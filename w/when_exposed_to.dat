5|$|Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a {{total of}} 32 {{scientific}} papers, including one that announced that, <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> radium, diseased, tumor-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.|$|E
5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. <b>When</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, {{which in turn}} flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium forms {{a number}} of oxides <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air, {{including}} rubidium monoxide (Rb2O), Rb6O, and Rb9O2; rubidium in excess oxygen gives the superoxide RbO2. Rubidium forms salts with halides, producing rubidium fluoride, rubidium chloride, rubidium bromide, and rubidium iodide.|$|E
5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (Class D type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E
50|$|Galeolaria {{build and}} live within white to grey {{calcareous}} tubes, up to 3 cm in length. These tubes {{may be found}} singly or in complex interwoven colonies, forming a distinctive zone at the mid tidal regions. They may be so thick and dense that they form a microhabitat for many other creatures. <b>When</b> <b>expose</b> <b>to</b> air at low tide, these animals retreat within their tubes.|$|R

5|$|Carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the {{presence}} of air at high temperatures. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen, may spontaneously combust <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air in coal mine waste tips, ship cargo holds and coal bunkers, and storage dumps.|$|E
5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> light, while {{ethyl bromoacetate}} is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures. Both have similar colors to the liquid {{used on the}} demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained phosgene oxime or hydrogen cyanide. These two chemicals can be fatal, {{but none of the}} protestors in this incident died.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius trivialis is a European {{species that}} is similar in {{appearance}} to L.argillaceifolius, and they are often confused for each other. L.trivialis can be distinguished by gills that stain brown <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the latex, and a preference for growing in conifer- and birch-rich boreal and subalpine forests. Variety megacarpus may be confused with L.pallescens, a smaller paler-colored species with latex that stains gills lilac rather than brown.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way. <b>When</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|Pest species adapt {{readily to}} a variety of environments, but prefer warm {{conditions}} found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> light. An exception to this is the Asian cockroach, which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces and pale colors.|$|E
30|$|The {{radioprotection}} {{issue is}} intrinsically linked {{also to the}} appropriateness issue. Some {{recent studies have shown}} significant percentages of partially or totally inappropriate radiological examinations, even in top-level academic medical centres [16, 17]. Exams that are not appropriate should not be performed, but exams that are not appropriate and yield even a very low biological risk to the patient should be avoided. The inappropriateness of imaging techniques, especially <b>when</b> <b>exposing</b> <b>to</b> ionizing radiation, is becoming economically and socially unsustainable.|$|R

5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air at room {{temperature}} for extended periods.

5|$|The overall shell {{morphology}} of L.gigas is {{not solely}} {{determined by the}} animal's genes; environmental conditions such as location, diet, temperature and depth, and biological interactions such as predation, can greatly affect it. Juvenile conches develop heavier shells <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> predators. Conches also develop wider and thicker shells with fewer but longer spines in deeper water.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{quenching}} {{rate from}} the supercooled state, Q-carbon {{can be a}} semiconductor or metallic. It glows more than diamond <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> even <b>to</b> low levels of energetic radiation because of its stronger negative electron affinity.|$|R
5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. <b>When</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
