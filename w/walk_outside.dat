5|$|The {{family was}} arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E
5|$|As {{they reach}} the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, {{revealing}} the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
60|$|Having {{finished}} {{changing his}} clothing, Leo <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> and {{mingled with the}} crowd of town people.|$|R
60|$|The {{junior partner}} at once <b>walked</b> <b>outside,</b> and, taking up {{a bunch of}} letters, handed them to Hal.|$|R
60|$|As the two <b>walked</b> <b>outside,</b> {{the eyes}} of the boy opened, and he glanced sharply after the pair.|$|R
5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised as he looked back {{that she had been}} pulling him away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E
25|$|Not to <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> {{permitted}} {{limits on}} the Sabbath.|$|E
25|$|The {{top deck}} {{on the new}} bridge was {{originally}} just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running {{down the center of}} the pedestrian area was added by the 1970s. Originally meant to be a heated indoor pedestrian area, due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside that keep the area slightly warmer than outside, and some heat loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b> In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade.|$|E
50|$|After {{finishing}} the story, Gordie <b>walks</b> <b>outside</b> and drives {{away with his}} son and his son's friend to take them swimming.|$|R
60|$|French {{gazed at}} it in a puzzled manner. They <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> to the camp, where the cowboys were {{finishing}} their breakfast.|$|R
60|$|The talk {{continued}} and Ritter listened closely to every word. Then he arose and motioned to Coulter, {{and the two}} <b>walked</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|R
25|$|Armed {{guards were}} posted at the camps, which {{were all in}} remote, desolate areas far from {{population}} centers. Internees were typically allowed to stay with their families, and were treated decently unless they violated the rules. There are documented instances of guards shooting internees who reportedly attempted to <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> the fences. One such shooting, that of James Wakasa at Topaz, led to a re-evaluation of the security measures in the camps. Some camp administrations eventually allowed relatively free movement outside the marked boundaries of the camps. Nearly {{a quarter of the}} internees left the camps to live and work elsewhere in the United States, outside the exclusion zone. Eventually, some were authorized to return to their hometowns in the exclusion zone under supervision of a sponsoring American family or agency whose loyalty had been assured.|$|E
500|$|While Poole is on a space <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> his EVA pod {{attempting}} {{to replace the}} unit, Hal takes control of the pod, severs his oxygen hose and sets him adrift. Bowman takes another pod to attempt rescue. Meanwhile, Hal turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, Hal refuses to let him in, stating that the astronauts' plan to deactivate him jeopardizes the mission. Bowman opens the ship's emergency airlock manually, enters the ship, and proceeds to Hal's processor core. Hal tries to reassure Bowman, then pleads with him to stop, and finally expresses fear. As Bowman gradually deactivates the circuits controlling HAL's higher intellectual functions, HAL regresses to his earliest programmed memory, the song [...] "Daisy Bell", which he sings for Bowman.|$|E
500|$|His family {{released}} a statement describing Armstrong as a [...] "reluctant American hero [...] served his nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut... While we mourn {{the loss of a}} very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves. For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink." [...] This prompted many responses, including the Twitter hashtag [...] "#WinkAtTheMoon".|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the Indian rider {{was close to the}} dooryard, and Dan <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> to meet him. As soon as the youth appeared, the savage halted his steed.|$|R
60|$|The pair <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> {{and the man}} {{locked the}} door. Then both hurried below {{and out of the}} side door to the street. They went as far as the corner.|$|R
50|$|Rebecca then <b>walks</b> <b>outside</b> {{to see a}} {{fire truck}} present and her classmates {{standing}} around. Through a door she sees the ghost of Ernessa, who slowly turns around and walks into the sun before vanishing.|$|R
500|$|Neighbor Patrick McQuaid {{said that}} he recalls, as a child, meeting Dugard through a fence in the Garridos' yard soon after the kidnapping. He {{said that she had}} {{identified}} herself by the name [...] "Jaycee" [...] and that when he asked her if she lived there or was just visiting, she answered that she lived there. At that point, Garrido came out and took her back indoors. He eventually built an eight-foot-tall fence around the backyard and set up a tent for Dugard, the first time that she was allowed to <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> since her kidnapping. She coped with her continued captivity by planting flowers in a garden and home-schooling her daughters. At one point, Garrido informed Dugard that to pacify his wife, she and her daughters were to address Nancy as their mother, and that she was to teach her daughters that she was their older sister. When Dugard and her daughters were eventually allowed to come into contact with other people, they continued this fiction.|$|E
500|$|At the Ipatiev House, Olga and {{her sisters}} were {{eventually}} required {{to do their own}} laundry and learned how to make bread. The girls took turns keeping Alexandra company and amusing Alexei, who was still confined to bed and suffering from pain after his latest injury. Olga was reportedly deeply depressed and lost a great deal of weight during her final months. [...] "She was thin, pale, and looked very sick", recalled one of the guards, Alexander Strekotin, in his memoirs. [...] "She took few walks in the garden, and spent most of her time with her brother." [...] Another guard recalled that the few times she did <b>walk</b> <b>outside,</b> she stood there [...] "gazing sadly into the distance, making it easy to read her emotions." [...] Later, Olga appeared angry with her younger sister Maria for being too friendly to the guards, reported Strekotin. After late June, when a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more stringent.|$|E
2500|$|The group’s {{supervisor}} quietly {{climbs out}} of bed in order to take a <b>walk</b> <b>outside.</b> His name is Prushevsky and, like Voschev, he feels that something is missing in his life. [...] "People make use of me," [...] he says to himself, [...] "but no one is glad of me." [...] He contemplates suicide but determines he will first write a letter to his sister.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy Valentine {{put on his}} coat, and <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> the {{railings}} {{towards the}} front door. As he went {{he thought he heard}} a far-away voice that he once knew call [...] "Ralph!" [...] But he never hesitated.|$|R
60|$|Ralph <b>walked</b> <b>outside.</b> It was now growing lighter in the east, for it {{was after}} four o'clock in the morning. He looked about the woodshed and the cottage, but {{everything}} appeared to be all right. Certainly nothing had been stolen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We are not intruding. Anybody <b>walks</b> <b>outside</b> this fence.' He {{indicated}} an iron railing newly tarred, dividing the wilder underwood amid which they stood {{from the inner}} and well-kept parts of the shrubbery, and against which {{the back of the}} gymnasium was built.|$|R
2500|$|Prefer {{being in}} nature: This happens mostly in less {{populated}} or rural areas, where people <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> {{early in the}} morning and go to defecate in the fields or bushes. They prefer to be in nature and the fresh air; instead of defecating in a closed space such as a toilet. There may be cultural or habitual preference for defecating [...] "in the open air", beside a local river or stream, or even the bush.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dedicated}} {{facility for}} Citywings' operations was {{opened in the}} former Jet2 administration offices and housed a check-in desk, reception lounge, toilet facilities and a small departure lounge. [...] The new facility also has access to security so passengers {{no longer need to}} <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> and through the Vehicle Security Point (VSP) to gain airside access. [...] The former administration building has been relocated next to the Citywing terminal and is used solely by airport staff. [...] At this point there were no further plans to build a new terminal closer to the runway.|$|E
2500|$|Keone Madrid {{directed}} and choreography a dance video titled [...] "Lois Lane" [...] and features {{a poem by}} Rudy Francisco [...] "I'm a Superman, thanks to Lois Lane" [...] which includes the line, [...] "Superman... The Man of steel, big Blue, the last son of Krypton, he is faster than a speeding bullet, stronger than a locomotive, he has Lasers for eyes, X-ray vision and can fly without even flapping his arms, but his most notable power... was Lois Lane, the love of an amazing woman is a phone booth, that can turn a man from a spineless news reporter into a symbol of justice, into the reason why it's safe to <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> while the sun is sleeping".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only mean}} what you mean," [...] {{answered}} the unknown in a temperate voice. [...] "What {{was it that}} you always meant on those million and one nights when you <b>walked</b> <b>outside</b> your Ludgate Hill shop and shook your hand in the air?" ...|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, Jesse {{returns to}} his house by the water and pours himself a drink. His wife calls and begins {{to leave a message}} on the {{answering}} machine, but Jesse doesn't pick up the phone. Instead he <b>walks</b> <b>outside</b> and watches the tide beneath the evening sky.|$|R

2500|$|They shot toward {{students}} standing {{close to}} a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They walked toward the west entrance, throwing pipe bombs, very few of which detonated. Meanwhile, inside the school, Patti Nielson, an art teacher, had noticed the commotion {{and walked toward the}} west entrance with a 17-year-old student, Brian Anderson. She had intended to <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> to tell the two students to [...] "Knock it off," [...] thinking Klebold and Harris were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened the first set of double doors, Harris and Klebold shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass and hitting Nielson in the shoulder with shrapnel. Nielson stood and ran back down the hall into the library, alerting the students inside to the danger and telling them to get under desks and keep silent. Nielson dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter. Anderson remained behind, caught between the exterior and interior doors.|$|E
60|$|In {{the pause}} which followed, {{footsteps}} were {{heard on the}} <b>walk</b> <b>outside,</b> and the girl sprang up with a beautiful blush.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} what the risks are," [...] he answered. [...] "I do. Come and <b>walk</b> <b>outside</b> with me, Mr. Pratt. We have half an hour before we leave. My people were more than ordinarily punctual." ...|$|E

50|$|The video {{starts in}} a dark house {{decorated}} for Christmas. We then see Miller-Heidke in a peach-coloured dress singing in numerous locations in a house including her living room with a fish tank. The outdoor Christmas decorations light up and Miller-Heidke <b>walks</b> <b>outside</b> and sings toward the camera as the video ends.|$|R
50|$|While {{waiting for}} the crew, Jos, the {{caretaker}} of the house, prepares a welcome home party for Vince. He is interrupted when he begins hearing strange noises.
