5000|$|In the July 27, 2009 {{issue of}} Newsweek, Jacob Weisberg lamented that HAA is [...] "going nowhere" [...] and {{commented on the}} {{existing}} employer-based health care system: We're missing the boat most completely by sticking with a workplace-based system that no longer makes sense. America {{has always been a}} mobile society, with a labor market that grows more fluid over time. Once, the norm was to work for a single employer for one's entire career. Today, people change jobs an average of 11 times before they reach 40. Fear of losing health coverage keeps people in jobs they would otherwise leave, creating a drag on economic efficiency. The Senate's smartest health-care , Ron Wyden of Oregon, believes <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>move</b> away from job-based insurance. He has introduced a bill that would do this by converting the tax deduction for employer-provided health insurance into a tax credit and requiring individuals to use it to buy insurance. This would achieve universal coverage, apply meaningful cost controls, and—according to the Congressional Budget Office—pay for itself within a few years. But Wyden's bill is going nowhere. Instead, Democrats are poised to pass legislation that spends an additional trillion dollars, fails to restrain spending, and shores up an anachronistic employer-based system.|$|E
5000|$|While {{in office}} as Minister of Works, Xun Shuang tried to balance {{relations}} between Dong Zhuo and other officials. In 190, {{a coalition of}} regional officials and warlords started a campaign against Dong Zhuo {{in the name of}} rescuing Emperor Xian from being held hostage by Dong Zhuo. As Dong Zhuo prepared to evacuate Luoyang and move the imperial capital to Chang'an in the west, two officials Yang Biao (楊彪) and Huang Wan (黃琬) strongly objected to his decision and had a heated argument with him in the imperial court. Xun Shuang was worried that Dong Zhuo would execute Yang Biao and Huang Wan for opposing him, so he pretended to openly chide Yang Biao and Huang Wan in front of everyone by saying, [...] "You think the Chancellor of State (Dong Zhuo) feels happy about having to do this?

50|$|We need {{to further}} {{focus on this}} {{exceptional}} portal and its potential mythological message. It has been long emphasised {{the importance of the}} solar symbols in the local vernacular art. Yet, this portal displays only two rosettes that can be related to the sun and possibly the cross {{as a symbol of the}} Christ, which actually is also connected to the sun. The other symbols are rather linked to the other celestial body, i.e. the moon. The relief moulding rope seems to me to indicate the presence of the snake, which, like other monsters in the ancient legends, protects the sacred room. The snake is a dominant motive on the church portals throughout the Carpathian Mountains, most often in stylized forms, but in a few cases even in plain shapes. According to Mircea Eliade, the snake was considered a lunar beast in the old European beliefs and therefore it is possible to read the lower part of the portal, on each side, as a full or new moon coiled up by a snake. In the same context, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>move</b> our attention upon the indented pattern around the aperture, which in the imagery of the local needle women represents the water wave or the river water, possibly the life giving water of a spring, surprisingly identical with the old Egyptian pictograph for the running water. Consequently, the small triangles filling the space in between the rosettes and crosses may represent small drops of rain fertilising the fields. Naturally, we may wonder: what did these ancient symbols want to tell us? In the ensemble moon-snake-rain or running water the church carpenter seems to have sought for the regenerating power of the nature.|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of new {{technologies}} expectations of new gender relations and (de) constructions also came. How is gender constructed {{in the age of}} the cyborgism?

This paper will focus on the gender construction of selected virtual game characters, by implementing an archetypal psychological approach. The &quot;virtual babes &quot; that will be discussed are Lara Croft of Tomb Raiders, Elexis Sinclaire of Sin, Ultravixen from the game with the same title and All New Gen(der) from the Bad Code game.
