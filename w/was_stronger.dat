By 1983, overall economic growth <b>was</b> <b>stronger,</b> and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3million in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances. In magic, fire <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than wind, wind <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than thunder, and thunder <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes and bows, axes and bows <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|R

5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel <b>was</b> <b>stronger,</b> thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E

JMA's peak intensity for Tingting was 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Tingting was also 150km/h (90mph) 1-minute sustained, or 130km/h (80mph) 10-minute sustained. The Hong Kong Observatory also assessed Tingting to have winds of 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. However, Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris, France proposed that Tingting <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> than officially reported.

5|$|This was Manchester United's 22nd Community Shield {{appearance}} and Arsenal's 17th. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson assessed before the match that his midfield <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> than before, despite selling first-team players David Beckham and Juan Sebastián Verón. Arsène Wenger was optimistic of Arsenal's {{prospects in the}} upcoming season despite having only made minor changes to his squad, and Chelsea's emergence as a competitor following Roman Abramovich's takeover.

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E

These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

5|$|In 1191 Leo {{captured}} and rebuilt Bagras, a strategically important fortress that Saladin had seized from the Knights Templar and then destroyed before abandoning it. Bohemond ordered Leo {{to return it}} to the Templars, but Leo refused, stating that his right of recent conquest <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> that the claim of the Templars who had lost their property. After Bohemond failed include Cilicia in his truce with Saladin in 1192, Leo invited him to Bagras to start negotiations. Bohemond accepted the offer, but Leo had him captured, forcing him to surrender Antioch. Although the noblemen (who were closely related to Armenian nobles) were willing to accept Leo's rule, the mainly Greek and Latin townspeople formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from occupying Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Spanish {{continued}} {{to strengthen their}} blockade of trade activities in the Sulu Archipelago, resulting in the blockade's opposition by Germans when many of their trading ships were seized by Spain. Both Berlin and London stated the archipelago should remain open to world trade route. Soon, the British began to co-operate with German when rumours about the seizure of their trading ship by the Spanish began arriving to Great Britain which lead the British to oppose the Spanish action. British and Germans then refused to recognise the Spanish sovereignty over Sulu. But with strong opposition from Germans over the illegal seizures of their ships and the British fear of the German presence (which <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> than the Spanish during the time), a protocol known as Madrid Protocol was then signed in Madrid to secure Spanish sovereignty over the archipelago, making the Spanish free to wage any war with the Sultanate of Sulu without the fear of other foreign western powers intervening and as a return the Spanish would not intervene {{in the affairs of}} British in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The 1923 West Indies touring team played 21 {{first-class}} {{matches in}} England, of which six were won, seven lost {{and the others}} drawn. The team's relative success, and particularly the performance of leading batsman George Challenor, persuaded English critics that West Indies cricket <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> than previously supposed; this {{was instrumental in the}} promotion of the team to Test match status in 1928. Challenor was the biggest individual success of the tour, but Constantine impressed English critics, through his style of play more than his statistical achievements. He played 20 first-class matches on the tour, scoring 425 runs at an average of 15.74 and taking 37 wickets at an average of 21.86. Against Oxford University, he scored 77, his maiden first-class fifty; his only other half century came against Derbyshire. He also took five wickets in an innings for the first time, in the match against Kent.|$|E

5|$|The 2001 India cyclone was {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone, in terms of barometric pressure, to form in the Arabian Sea on record; only Cyclone Gonu in 2007 <b>was</b> <b>stronger.</b> The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May18. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May24 with winds of 215km/h (135mph 3-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the Arabian Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Heath {{ministry}} {{continued to}} experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973, subsequently losing the February 1974 general election. Labour formed a minority government {{and went on}} to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election. Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Thatcher was not initially seen as the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start. Her main support came from the parliamentary 1922 Committee and The Spectator, but Thatcher's time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist rather than that of an ideologue. She defeated Heath on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership. In the second ballot she defeated Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor. The vote polarised along right–left lines, with the region, experience and education of the MP also having their effects. Thatcher's support <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> among MPs on the right, those from southern England, and those who had not attended public schools or Oxbridge.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{positions}} were well-sited {{on the spur}} for an attack from the east along the track from Katika to Sattelberg, but at this point, Captain B. G.

A furious fight ensured. The Japanese held their fire until the Australians were almost on top of them. Realising that the position <b>was</b> <b>stronger</b> than he had thought, Cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded. Windeyer ordered the 2/17th to bypass the position and proceed to its objective, the high ground south of the Song River. The 2/15th was ordered to attack Katika Spur. The attack was delivered at 15:15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars, but the Japanese defenders had withdrawn, leaving behind eight dead.

Edward confirmed Warwick's position as Captain of Calais, and made him High Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices. His brothers also benefited: John Neville, Lord Montagu, was made Warden of the East March in 1463, and the next year created Earl of Northumberland.
