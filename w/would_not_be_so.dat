Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> similar in different directions.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple of}} seasons later in 1983–84 Genoa <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> lucky, despite beating champions Juventus {{on the final}} day of the season, the club were relegated even though they {{finished}} the season with the same number of points as surviving Lazio; this was because Lazio had recorded better results in matches against Genoa.|$|E
25|$|The {{next season}} for the club in Serie A <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> fortunate, they were relegated in 17th place. Some notable high points of the season {{included}} a 1–0 victory over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. A team from Rome would also be the opposition for Messina's other most impressive result of the season, they stunned Lazio by beating them 4–0 {{on the last day}} of the season.|$|E

25|$|After {{the heavy}} defeat to New Zealand their next {{international}} fixture would be during their second World Cup where the Tongans would again {{be placed in}} another tough group with France, Papua New Guinea again and the South Africans. Tonga would face South Africa in their first match of the tournament {{where they would be}} comfortable victors in a 66–18 drubbing, however the rest of the tournament <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> kind to the Tongan side with losses to both France and Papua New Guinea meaning the Tongans would again fail to make it past the first stage of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Growth {{continued}} {{throughout the}} decade of the 1940s, with the CCW growing from a network of 126 affiliate store with 50,000 members and sales of $4.7 million in 1941 to 211 stores with about 90,000 members and sales of about $11.5 million in 1948. The next decade <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> kind, however, as the Central Wholesale organization began a long term decline owing in large measure to the growth of supermarkets in the United States. This loss of size and strength moved the CCW to seek formal consolidation with other like-minded enterprises in the region.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} Syracuse, the richest and most {{powerful}} city of Sicily, felt that the Athenians were in fact coming to attack them under the pretense of aiding Segesta in a minor war. The Syracusan general Hermocrates suggested that they ask for help from other Sicilian cities, and from Carthage. He also wanted to meet the Athenian fleet in the Ionian Sea before they arrived. Others argued that Athens was no threat to Syracuse, and some people did not believe there was a fleet at all, because Athens <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> foolish as to attack them {{while they were still}} at war with Sparta. Athenagoras accused Hermocrates and others of attempting to instill fear among the population and trying to overthrow the government.|$|E

25|$|The opening {{game of the}} Olympics {{was against}} Cuba. Although the USA had played Cuba several times during their {{exhibition}} tour, and won handily, none of those games counted. A loss in the preliminary round wouldn't eliminate the team form medal contention, but a second loss would, so there was additional pressure. The USA team was playing {{in front of a}} home crowd, and played tight in the beginning, while Cuba hit six of their first eight shots to take a 14–7 lead. The team settled down, helped by a spark from the reserves, and went on to win 101–84. The second game was against Ukraine, another team they had played in exhibition, but a team that had done well against the USA, worrying VanDerveer. This time, the result <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> close, and the USA team won their second game 98–65.|$|E
500|$|As the fleets converged, Victory’s captain, Thomas Hardy, {{suggested}} that Nelson remove the decorations on his coat, {{so that he}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> easily identified by enemy sharpshooters. Nelson replied {{that it was too}} late [...] "to be shifting a coat", adding that they were [...] "military orders and he did not fear to show them to the enemy". Captain Henry Blackwood, of the frigate , suggested Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe the battle. Nelson refused, and also turned down Hardy's suggestion to let Eliab Harvey's [...] come ahead of Victory and lead the line into battle.|$|E
500|$|From the Persian perspective, {{such terms}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> humiliating {{as they might}} at first seem. The Persians already allowed the Greek cities of Asia to be governed under their own laws (under the {{reorganization}} conducted by Artaphernes, following the Ionian Revolt). By these terms, the Ionians were still Persian subjects, as they had been. Furthermore, Athens had already demonstrated their superiority at sea at the Eurymedon and Salamis-in-Cyprus, so any legal limitations for the Persian fleet {{were nothing more than}} [...] "de jure" [...] recognition of military realities. In exchange for limiting the movement of Persian troops in one region of the realm, Artaxerxes secured a promise from the Athenians to stay out of his entire realm.|$|E

500|$|His contemporaries noted his {{classical}} style. The journalist A.R.B. Palmer {{described his}} cover drive as [...] "... perfectly balanced and true ... the bat seems a whip in his hands." [...] Clem Hill, the former Australian captain, noted Jackson's sparkling footwork, watching {{close enough to}} notice that his toes turned in as he walked. [...] Like Kippax, whose style was uncannily similar, Jackson wore his shirt-sleeves almost down to his wrists. This was not in imitation but to conceal the blemishes on his arms caused by psoriasis. Kippax was not seen by some as the best person to imitate, with Charles Kelleway critical of Jackson's flourishes, wishing he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so,</b> [...] "... cramped in copying other batsman's styles".|$|E
500|$|Gleeson further {{distinguished}} himself {{later that}} year by assisting in the defence of a trench against enemy attack. [...] He had {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of freeing Belgium from German occupation but was known to be critical of what he considered anti-clerical views held by the French authorities. [...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and caked and crusted with cold, wet trench mud, like these poor soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> glib with their treatises on the art of war. These militants should be made undergo a few nights in cheerless billets [...] mud-river trenches to teach them a lesson. What is it all for at all?".|$|E
500|$|By January 1915, {{the horrific}} {{nature of the}} war was apparent. Michael felt [...] "greatly embittered towards people in general and most of all towards those who are at the top, who hold power and allow all that horror to happen. If the {{question}} of war were decided by the people at large, I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> passionately averse to that great calamity." [...] Michael confessed {{in a letter to his}} wife that he felt [...] "ashamed to face the people, i.e. the soldiers and officers, particularly when visiting field hospitals, where so much suffering is to be seen, for they might think that one is also responsible, for one is placed so high and yet has failed to prevent all that from happening and protect one's country from this disaster." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{of these}} boards were ineffectual. By the 1920s, the New York stage, a {{frequent}} source of subsequent screen material, had topless shows; performances {{were filled with}} curse words, mature subject matter, and sexually suggestive dialogue. Early during the sound system conversion process, {{it became apparent that}} what might be acceptable in New York <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> in Kansas. In 1927, Hays suggested studio executives form a committee to discuss film censorship. Irving G. Thalberg of Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM), Sol Wurtzel of Fox, and E. H. Allen of Paramount responded by collaborating on a list they called the [...] "Don'ts and Be Carefuls", based on items that were challenged by local censor boards, and which consisted of eleven subjects best avoided, and twenty-six to be handled very carefully. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved the list, and Hays created the SRC to oversee its implementation. However, there was still no way to enforce these tenets. The controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} edited by series regular Jay Rabinowitz in a Manhattan NBC facility, with {{consultation}} {{at various times}} by Fleder, Yoshimura and Tom Fontana. Rabinowitz edited the episode for several days alone, then worked with Fleder for four days, making hundreds of edits to the episode. Yoshimura worked with the editor next and was disappointed with the first cut of the episode that he saw, claiming that {{it needed to be}} [...] "a lot more frenetic and chaotics at the end, and not so artsy". Yoshimura also told Rabinowitz that the final cut of the episode should place strong emphasis on Braugher because he felt that the story is experienced [...] "through his eyes". During the editing process, Yoshimura originally removed a scene featuring a silhouette of Pembleton riding the escalator out of the subway station after Lange died. Yoshimura felt that the shot was too sentimental, but Levinson personally had it placed back in the episode after Fleder claimed to have [...] "begged" [...] for it to be included. When Fontana first watched the episode, he felt that the prologue was too confusing because it was difficult to tell what happened during the accident scene. It was edited so that rather focusing on medium shots of D'Onofrio and MacVittie, it included a wider shot to establish the presence of a subway train before the accident so viewers <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> confused.|$|E
2500|$|The {{goal of the}} new {{magazine}} was to be basically a magazine, but with sports. Many at Time-Life scoffed at Luce's idea; in his Pulitzer Prize–winning biography, Luce and His Empire, W. A. Swanberg wrote that the company's intellectuals dubbed the proposed magazine [...] "Muscle", [...] "Jockstrap", and [...] "Sweat Socks". Launched on August 16, 1954, it was not profitable (and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> for 12 years) and not particularly well run at first, but Luce's timing was good. The popularity of spectator sports in the United States was about to explode, and that popularity came to be driven largely by three things: economic prosperity, television, and Sports Illustrated.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2015, John McEnroe {{was interviewed}} on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. [...] At that time, McEnroe was 56 years old but still active on the seniors tennis circuit, Serena Williams was 34 {{years old and}} in the chase for a [...] "calendar-year" [...] Grand Slam. McEnroe {{mentioned}} to Kimmel that about 15 years prior, Donald Trump had suggested {{that he would like}} to put together a [...] "battle of the sexes" [...] match between McEnroe and Williams. McEnroe said he would face Williams but that Trump was not offering a big enough payout. McEnroe boasted that he believed he could take Williams in a tennis match, but he joked that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> confident if it were a boxing match.|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{denied that}} the songs were {{anything}} but about personal experience, and were not about the United States. It quickly became the fastest selling album that Morrison had recorded {{at that time and}} went gold within three months. Relocating to Europe within a few years, his work during the 1980s <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> [...] "radio friendly" [...] and easily accessible to the casual listener. With the success of Wavelength Morrison assembled a band to promote it, which was similar in many ways to the abandoned Caledonia Soul Orchestra of It's Too Late to Stop Now fame. During the Wavelength tour, Morrison performed in his native Belfast [...] {{for the first time since}} leaving for the US to record [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] for Bang Records. Morrison's first video, Van Morrison in Ireland, released in 1981, resulted from these performances and featured two songs from the album: [...] "Wavelength" [...] and [...] "Checkin' It Out".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{three months before}} his execution, Kelly said {{that at the time}} of the incident, he was 200 miles from home, and according to him, his mother had asked Fitzpatrick if he had a warrant and Fitzpatrick said that he had only a telegram to which his mother said that Dan need not go. Fitzpatrick then said, pulling out a revolver, [...] "I will blow your brains out if you interfere." [...] His mother replied, [...] "You <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> handy with that popgun of yours if Ned were here." [...] Dan then said, trying to trick Fitzpatrick, [...] "There is Ned coming along by the side of the house." [...] While he was pretending to look out of the window for Ned, Dan cornered Fitzpatrick, took the revolver and claimed that he had released Fitzpatrick unharmed. When Kelly was asked if Fitzpatrick tried to take liberties with his sister, Kate Kelly, he said [...] "No, that is a foolish story; if he or any other policeman tried to take liberties with my sister, Victoria would not hold him." ...|$|E
