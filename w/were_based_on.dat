5|$|As Vega {{had long}} {{been used as a}} {{standard}} star for calibrating telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that <b>were</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> it being spherically symmetric.

5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems <b>were</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song {{broke away from}} this pattern of programmatic symphonic works, as Dvořák did not specify a specific accompanying text, and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized {{as a reason for}} its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested that the work was intended to be autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works <b>were</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E
