5|$|Moore {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1942, where he was tasked with drawing {{airplane}} diagrams. A problem <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> prevented him from being aircrew. In late 1943, following recommendations from artists William Dargie and Harold Herbert, he was commissioned as an official war artist attached to the army, and given the rank of lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E

5|$|Krishna {{is often}} {{depicted}} wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, {{and playing the}} bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he is usually shown standing <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> bent {{in front of the}} other in the Tribhanga posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic and seductive man with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.|$|E
5|$|The Borobudur reliefs {{also pay}} close {{attention}} to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at 4years {{of age in}} the wild and at 3years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the dry season). Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse. Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> while passively placing the other in the female's back. As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation. The female lays 2–4eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present {{in the vicinity of the}} nest when providing food. Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame. The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65days after they hatch. Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg,</b> but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Crouching {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be synonymous with squatting. It is common to squat <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> and kneel with the other leg. One or both heels may be up when squatting. Young children often instinctively squat. Among Chinese, Southeast Asian, and Eastern European adults, squatting often {{takes the place of}} sitting or standing.|$|E
25|$|The most usual leg {{movement}} {{with the front}} crawl is called the flutter kick. The legs move alternately, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> kicking downward while the other leg moves upward. While the legs provide {{only a small part}} of the overall speed, they are important to stabilize the body position. This lack of balance is apparent when using a pull buoy to neutralize the leg action.|$|E

25|$|West's {{father died}} {{around the time}} of his birth in Washington, D.C. His mother was hospitalized with {{tuberculosis}} in 1882 and young Jimmie was placed in the Washington City Orphan Home; his mother died later that year. In 1883, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and by 1885 he was crippled, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> shorter than the other. At the orphanage, Jimmie was put to work with the girls, sewing and caning chairs. He became a voracious reader and took charge of the orphanage library. After convincing the staff that he could continue his chores (stoking the furnace and caring for chickens) he entered public school at the fifth grade. In 1895, he graduated with honors from Business High School, where he had edited the school newspaper, was business manager of the football team and had acted as a substitute math teacher.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} at Alma College, Hull moved to Hibbing, Minnesota to work as an {{apprentice}} mining engineer. However, after two months he was afflicted by polio, which left him paralyzed <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg,</b> causing him to recover at his parents home {{for a year and}} forcing him to reconsider his life path. He considered becoming a minister of Unitarianism, because he found their philosophy focused sermons appealing. His love of philosophy eventually led to his interest in Psychology, which he studied during his recovery. He began his journey by reading William James’ book Principles of Psychology. He also took a particular interest in the works of Watson and Pavlov. A little after he started reading, his eyes would become weak and his mother would read to him until his eyes became strong enough for him to read on his own. A year later, he decided to teach back home in the one room school, which had expanded to two-rooms. After his two years teaching, he married Bertha Iutzi with very little money.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{around the}} second {{third of the}} 6th century BC, Attic artists became {{interested}} in mythological scenes and other representations of figures. Animal friezes became less important. Only a few painters took care with them, and they were generally moved {{from the center of}} attention to less important areas of vases. This new style is especially represented by the François vase, signed by both the potter Ergotimos and the painter Kleitias (570–560 BC). This krater is considered to be the most famous Greek painted vase. It is the first known volute krater made of clay. Mythological events are depicted in several friezes, with animal friezes being shown in secondary locations. Several iconographic and technical details appear on this vase for the first time. Many are unique, such as the representation of a lowered mast of a sailing ship; others became part of the standard repertoire, such as people sitting <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> behind the other, instead of with the traditional parallel positioning of the legs. Four other, smaller vases were signed by Ergotimos and Kleitias, and additional vases and fragments are attributed to them. They provide evidence for other innovations by Kleitias, like the first depiction of the birth of Athena or of the Dance on Crete.|$|E

25|$|A brown recluse's {{stance on}} a flat surface is usually with all legs {{radially}} extended. When alarmed it may lower its body, withdraw the forward two legs straight rearward into a defensive position, withdraw the rearmost pair of legs into a position for lunging forward, and stand motionless with pedipalps raised. The pedipalps in mature specimens are dark and quite prominent and are normally held horizontally forward. When threatened it usually flees, seemingly to avoid a conflict, and if detained may further avoid contact with quick horizontal rotating movements or even resort to assuming a lifeless pose (playing dead). The spider does not usually jump unless touched brusquely, and even then its avoidance movement is more of a horizontal lunge rather than a vaulting of itself entirely off the surface. When running, the brown recluse does not leave a silk line behind, which would make it more easily tracked when it is being pursued. Movement at virtually any speed is an evenly paced gait with legs extended. When missing a leg or two it appears to favor this same gait, although (presumably when a leg has been injured) it may move and stand at rest <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> slightly withdrawn. During travel it stops naturally and periodically when renewing its internal hydraulic blood pressure that, like most spiders, it requires to renew strength in its legs.|$|E
