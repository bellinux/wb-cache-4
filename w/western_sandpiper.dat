The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America.

40|$|Sexual {{segregation}} {{outside the}} mating season {{is common in}} vertebrates, and {{has been attributed to}} sexual differences in predator escape performance in ungulates and fish, but not in birds. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sex- and latitude-specific predator escape performance underlies the differential nonbreeding distribution of <b>western</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris mauri), a migratory shorebird. Females overwinter further south along the American Pacific coast, creating a latitudinal cline in sex ratio. Escape performance is reduced with increasing body mass, and birds generally carry less fat further south. <b>Western</b> <b>sandpipers</b> with poor escape performance were therefore predicted to prefer southern sites {{to reduce the risk of}} mortality posed by predators. Data from four nonbreeding latitudes showed that wing loading, used as an index of escape performance, was overall higher for females, and that it decreased with latitude in both sexes. Within latitudes, wing loading was lower at smaller, and presumably more dangerous, sites. Flight response to a predatory attack was longer in the south.

40|$|I tested {{predictions}} about foraging decisions and stopover durations {{based on a}} mortality-minimizing migratory model in two shorebird species on southward migration.

Late migrants had higher vigilance, and stopover duration trends fitting reduced vulnerability at the expense of migratory speed. Flight initiation distance and spatial usage were not consistent with predictions.

500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first <b>western</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The <b>western</b> <b>sandpiper</b> has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|E

40|$|Myers {{proposed}} the Migration Distance Hypothesis (that {{the costs of}} long-distance migration force a compensating reduction in breeding investment) to explain parental care differences between species and sexes in shorebirds. This thesis proposes that seasonally increasing predation danger during migration is the main cost of extending breeding investment, and examines whether danger and other cross-seasonal factors predict reproductive patterns of Pacific Dunlins (Calidris alpina pacifica) and other shorebird species breeding in Alaska. The Predation Danger Hypothesis assumes that moult and migration schedules of shorebirds evolved to minimize exposure to raptors, especially migratory Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus). The hypothesis predicts that these scheduling considerations affect parental care because they either require shorebirds to depart breeding areas early and in advance of falcon migration and moult on non-breeding areas prior to the migratory arrival of falcons; or to remain on or near northern breeding areas to moult, and migrate after falcon passage. Following breeding, Pacific Dunlins linger in Alaska until October, arriving on wintering areas after peak falcon passage. I found that breeding Pacific Dunlins renested and double-brooded extensively. Female Pacific Dunlins invested more time to reproduction and remained longer on the breeding grounds than female <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris mauri), their sympatrically-breeding, ecologically-similar, and early-migrating congener. The breeding seasons of both species were initiated on almost the same day, but the breeding investment of female Pacific Dunlins exceeded that of female <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> by 7. 2 days, and the seasonal decline in parental care duration of <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> was steeper than in Pacific Dunlins. As predicted, <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> but not Pacific Dunlins departed sooner in years with early falcon southward migration (related to snowmelt timing), and they gave up more breeding opportunity to do so. Stable isotope analyses showed that Dunlins and other sandpipers are primarily income rather than capital breeders and I found little support for the Differential Parental Capacity Hypothesis (that female shorebirds truncate care due to higher investment in egg production). These findings support the Predation Danger Hypothesis and highlight how predation danger can have far-reaching impacts on the life histories of potential prey species...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of top predators can affect prey behaviour, morphology and life history, and thereby can produce indirect population consequences greater and further reaching than direct depredation would have alone. Raptor {{species in the}} Americas are recovering since restrictions {{on the use of}} dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and the implementation of conservation measures, in effect constituting a hemisphere-wide predator-reintroduction experiment, and profound effects on populations of their prey are to be expected.

Comparisons between years, sites and seasons strongly implicate increasing danger from the recovery of peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) as a causal factor.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{potential}} selective importance of predation danger {{on the evolution}} of migration strategies of arctic-breeding calidrid sandpipers. Adult calidrids truncate parental care for reasons not obviously related to levels of food abundance on the breeding areas or at migratory stopover sites, suggesting that a different trade-off occurs between providing additional care and adult survivorship. The southward migrations of adult <b>western</b> <b>sandpipers</b> precede those of migratory peregrine falcons by almost a month. By moving early and quickly, adults remain ahead of migrant falcons all the way to their non-breeding areas, where they rapidly moult flight feathers. They complete the moult just as falcons arrive in late September¿October. By migrating early, they avoid exposure to falcons when they are unusually vulnerable, due to the requirements for fuelling migratory flight and of wing feather moult. Juvenile <b>western</b> <b>sandpipers</b> migrate south just as falcon numbers start to increase, but do not moult flight feathers in their first winter. Pacific dunlin use an alternative strategy of remaining and moulting in Alaska after falcons depart, and migrating to their overwintering sites after migrants have passed. East of the Rocky Mountains, the southbound migration of falcons begins 4 ¿ 6 weeks later. Southbound semipalmated sandpipers make extended migratory stopovers, but their lengths of stay shorten prior to falcon migration to the sites in September. Predation danger also may affect the evolution of migration routes. Southbound <b>western</b> <b>sandpipers</b> fly directly from Alaska to southern British Columbia, in contrast to the multi-stage journey northward along the Alaska panhandle. We estimate that a direct flight would be more economical on northward migration, but may be avoided because it would expose sandpipers to higher mass-dependent predation danger from migratory falcons, which travel north with sandpipers. By contrast, few raptors are present in Alaska during preparation for the southward flight. A temporal and spatial window of safety may also permit semipalmated sandpipers to become extremely vulnerable while preparing for trans-Atlantic southward flights. Danger management may account for the these previously enigmatic features of calidrid migration strategies, and aspects of those of other birds...|$|R
40|$|Exercise-induced muscle {{damage is}} a well-described {{consequence}} of strenuous exercise, but its potential {{importance in the}} evolution of animal activity patterns is unknown. We used plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity as an indicator of muscle damage to investigate whether the high intensity, long-duration flights of two migratory shorebird species cause muscle damage that must be repaired during stopover. In two years of study, plasma CK activity was significantly higher in migrating <b>western</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (a non-synchronous, short-hop migrant), than in non-migrants. Similarly, in the bar-tailed godwit (a synchronous, long-jump migrant), plasma CK activity was highest immediately after arrival from a 4000 – 5000 km flight from West Africa to The Netherlands, and declined before departure for the arctic breeding areas. Late-arriving godwits had higher plasma CK activity than birds that had been at the stopover site longer. Juvenile <b>western</b> <b>sandpipers</b> making their first southward migration had higher plasma CK activity than adults. These results indicate that muscle damage occurs during migration, and that it is exacerbated in young, relatively untrained birds. However, the magnitude of the increases in plasma CK activity associated with migratory flight were relatively small, suggesting that the level of muscle damage is moderate. Migrants may avoid damage behaviourally, or have efficient biochemical and physiological defences against muscle injury. ...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{conservation}} {{management of}} migratory birds {{can be challenging}} and requires knowledge about population structure {{and the strength of}} migratory connectivity. The latter likely affects the degree to which populations are locally adapted and differentiated, and both may affect their ability to adapt to environmental changes. <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris mauri) are long-distance migrants that exhibit latitudinal differences in morphology and life-history strategies across their non-breeding range. The differential migration patterns in this small shorebird species could be based on population genetic differences or phenotypic plasticity. I investigated the population structure of <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> and its implications for differential migration and conservation, across their global range using genetic, morphometric and acoustic data. I recorded and analyzed breeding male vocalizations, conducted playback experiments and collected genetic and morphometric data across breeding and non-breeding ranges. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP) and mtDNA sequence data indicated low, but significant genetic population structure across breeding and non-breeding ranges. I found evidence for an evolutionarily recent demographic expansion (mtDNA), for latitudinal clines in genetic scores (AFLP) and for isolation by distance (AFLP). A scan of thousands of AFLP markers in a pooled lane approach revealed no fixed genetic differences among juveniles with a postulated difference in life-history strategy or migratory direction. Songs, but not alarm calls, varied geographically, decreasing in length and increasing in fundamental frequencies from southern to northern breeding sites. These geographic differences were sufficiently large to allow males to discriminate between local and non-local songs and hence are potentially biologically relevant. AFLP scores and vocalization frequencies showed correlations with body size. In conjunction, my results suggest that <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> underwent a recent range and population expansion that has resulted in divergence patterns that are primarily isolation by distance driven. My results suggest interrelationships among genetic population structure, morphology and latitudinal segregation. While populations were not sufficiently distinct to allow for assignment tests, the latitudinal gradients found across both the breeding and non-breeding grounds are suggestive of a gradual ’chain’-like migration pattern, but do not indicate strong migratory connectivity. Consequently, conservation strategies could focus on the protection of major sites at different latitudes...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} habitat {{selection}} often requires individuals {{to choose among}} habitats that differ in foraging profitability and predation danger. The local habitat distribution of <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris maur~] was studied at Bahia Santa Maria, northwest Mexico, for three non-breeding seasons (1 999 - 2002). <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> are highly sexually dimorphic, males being lighter and smaller-billed than females, and thus males may use visual foraging more often, be more susceptible to interference, and be less vulnerable to predation than females. Bahia Santa Maria supports over 350, 000 <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> in a diverse mosaic of habitats. Three habitats were categorized - brackish flats, mangroves, and cattail marshes- that differed with respect to food abundance and predation danger. Brackish flats were high-food and low-danger, while mangroves and cattail marshes were low-food and high-danger. Sandpiper and prey densities covaried positively among habitats, with brackish flats supporting the highest bird density. Males, and adults within each sex, were over-represented in brackish flats and mangroves. Sex ratios, and age ratios within each sex, were more evenly represented in cattail marshes. Compared with females, males were biased towards visual foraging and using drier substrates, changed their foraging behaviour more as flock size increased, {{were more likely to}} be territorial and aggressive, and allocated less time to anti-predator behaviour. Sex differences in foraging behaviour were consistent among habitats. Birds in brackish flats and mangroves were more biased towards visual foraging than those in cattail marshes. In brackish flats, birds changed their foraging behaviour more strongly with increasing flock size. Territoriality was observed in brackish flats and mangroves. Territory length appeared to be related to intruder pressure. Sandpipers apparently perceived cattail marshes as more dangerous than brackish flats and adjusted their anti-predator behaviour accordingly. Significant numbers of birds occurred in habitats with lower food availability and greater predation danger, suggesting a density-dependent devaluation of brackish flats. Overall, there is evidence that (0 females are more constrained by predation danger and males more constrained by interference, and (;I] that density-dependent competition is important in shaping local distributions of sandpipers during the non-breeding season...|$|R
40|$|Estuarine {{intertidal}} habitats are heterogeneous, therefore migratory shorebirds {{are expected}} to forage in microhabitats where they can maximize their energy intake. Identifying proximate factors that migratory shorebirds use to accept or reject a particular habitat patch will help land managers make conservation and restoration decisions that provide the greatest benefits to shorebird populations during migration, a period of intense energy usage. We examined whether small semipermanent tidal channels were preferentially used by foraging <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris mauri) and Dunlins (C. alpina) during a spring migratory stopover in Bandon Marsh, an Oregon, USA, estuary. Further, we tested alternative hypotheses about how channels might be beneficial to shorebirds by examining infauna abundance, composition, and depth alongside channels compared with that in open mudflats. The densities of <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> and Dunlins were at least 4 times higher along channels than in open mudflat habitats. Infauna along channels were twice as abundant {{as those in the}} surrounding mudflats, and infauna were generally found closer to the surface. Furthermore, sediment alongside channels required less than half the force to probe, probably increasing shorebirds 2 ̆ 7 overall access to prey. We conclude that shorebirds selected microhabitats near channels because of the greater food abundance and availability. Additional evidence suggested that another microhabitat, patches of red algae (Gracilaria sp.), may also have conferred advantages on foraging shorebirds. Channels may be a valuable microhabitat to consider when selecting conservation areas for shorebirds, and maintaining channels (e. g., through maintaining natural hydrology and sedimentation patterns) should be considered in management practices...|$|R
40|$|To migrate successfully, birds need {{to store}} {{adequate}} fat reserves to fuel each {{leg of the}} journey.

Here, we evaluate the factors underlying stopover-site usage by migrant <b>Western</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris mauri) on a landscape scale. We measured the food and danger attributes of 17 potential stopover sites in the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound region.

The model including both food and safety best-predicted site usage by sandpipers. Furthermore, lean sandpipers used the most dangerous sites, whereas heavier birds (which do not need to risk feeding in dangerous locations) used safer sites.
