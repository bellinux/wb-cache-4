However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song.

[...] Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly perceived that Cher's vocals are heavily processed due {{to the use of}} auto-tune. Lyrically, [...] "A Different Kind of Love Song" [...] alludes to themes of tragedy, heroism and , as noted by Rolling Stone journalist Barry Walters. The song was also treated with different remixes done by producers such as Rodney Jerkins. In an interview with MTV News, Jerkins expressed that he was flattered to be working with Cher. He further added, [...] "It's incredible {{to be able to work}} with a true diva.

Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast.

She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed at her father Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do.

Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening in a way they could dance to it. Released on February 6, 1991, [...] "State of the World" [...] was the eighth and the final single of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814.

[...] "From that point on," [...] writes Bolland, [...] "either he [...] or his successor Steve MacManus called me direct whenever they <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a Dredd story."
