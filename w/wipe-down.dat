25|$|The medical {{industry}} utilizes {{a variety}} of energy methods to address bioburden issues associated with biofouling. Autoclaving typically involves heating a medical device to 121°C (249°F) for 15–20 minutes. Ultrasonic cleaning, UV light, and chemical <b>wipe-down</b> or emersion {{can also be used}} for different types of devices.|$|E

Characters disappear and reappear, the visible {{parameters of the}} stage merely one of their playgrounds. The visual discord finally gains momentum when Bunnie executes {{some of the players}} with her shotgun. It is left for the primly dressed Mama character to clean up the mess, including giving the bloodied screen a <b>wipe-down.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dogs of this breed have an {{extremely}} short and almost odorless coat that requires {{little more than}} an occasional bath about once a month (though many veterinarians suggest that even bathing once per month is too frequent for this breed), but a <b>wipe-down</b> with a damp cloth is recommended after walks as seeds, burrs and floating dust in the air can get into the coat and irritate the skin. This breed sheds medium to little hair.|$|E

The book contains important and common terminology such as standard abbreviations, basic drug calculations and standard CPR procedures. The book also has <b>wipe-down</b> laminated pages making it ideal for use on a ward.

40|$|Exposure {{control systems}} {{performance}} {{was investigated in}} an aircraft painting hangar. The ability of the ventilation system and respiratory protection program to limit worker exposures was examined through air sampling during painting of F/A- 18 C/D strike fighter aircraft, in four field surveys. Air velocities were measured across the supply filter, exhaust filter, and hangar midplane under crossflow ventilation. Air sampling conducted during painting process phases (<b>wipe-down,</b> primer spraying, and topcoat spraying) encompassed volatile organic compounds, total particulate matter, Cr[VI], metals, nitroethane, and hexamethylene diisocyanate, for two worker groups: sprayers and sprayer helpers ("hosemen"). One of six methyl ethyl ketone and two of six methyl isobutyl ketone samples exceeded the short term exposure limits of 300 and 75 ppm, with means 57 ppm and 63 ppm, respectively. All 12 Cr[VI] 8 -hr time-weighted averages exceeded the recommended exposure limit of 1 25 g/m 3, 11 out of 12 exceeded the permissible exposure limit of 5 25 g/m 3, and 7 out of 12 exceeded the threshold limit value of 10 25 g/m 3, with means 38 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 8. 3 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Hexamethylene diisocyanate means were 5. 95 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 0. 645 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Total reactive isocyanate group [...] the total of monomer and oligomer as NCO group mass [...] showed 6 of 15 personal samples exceeded the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive workplace exposure limit of 20 25 g/m 3, with means 50. 9 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 7. 29 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Several exposure limits were exceeded, reinforcing continued use of personal protective equipment. The supply rate, 94. 4 m 3 /s (200, 000 cfm), produced a velocity of 8. 58 m/s (157 fpm) at the supply filter, while the exhaust rate, 68. 7 m 3 /s (146, 000 cfm), drew 1. 34 m/s (264 fpm) at the exhaust filter. Midway between supply and exhaust locations, the velocity was 0. 528 m/s (104 fpm). Supply rate exceeding exhaust rate created re-circulations, turbulence, and fugitive emissions, while wasting energy. Smoke releases showing more effective ventilation here than in other aircraft painting facilities carries technical feasibility relevance.
