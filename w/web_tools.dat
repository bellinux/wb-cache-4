The GTEN network and its support tools were developed {{with support from the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the goal of lessening illness relating to crossing international borders and the likelihood of disease importation into home communities. This program has included the development of a number of public health programs and resources, including <b>web</b> <b>tools</b> that provide up-to-date recommendations on health interventions and risks; these resources are maintained within the Heading Home Healthy Program.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} a product of {{collaboration}} between the EPS students at EPSEVG and Catalonia Railway Museum. The goal was to create a <b>web</b> <b>tool,</b> test it and launch it. The aim of the <b>web</b> <b>tool</b> is to facilitate the communication between railway museums on a global level. A need for such a tool is present because at the moment there is no existing platform for a fast, private and simple communication between railway museums. The <b>web</b> <b>tool</b> functions like a forum, the message board will enable the possibility to have discussions, group chats and other functions that can be expected in a forum. AngularJS, as the backend framework, and Lumen, for the backend, were used to develop the <b>web</b> <b>tool.</b> The code is documented well, to make sure that next developers have an easy start and are able to implement new features quickly. Since this is a forum that will be used by colleagues on an international level the main language will be English, with a possibility to translate it to any other language. The <b>web</b> <b>tool</b> gets translated by the Google translate widget, owned and powered by Google. Before the launching of the <b>web</b> <b>tool</b> a user survey was complete. The test persons included museum personnel, students, usability professors, family and friends. After a mostly positive feedback, few corrections were made before the <b>web</b> <b>tool,</b> with the name "Elephorum", was launched...|$|R

30|$|A {{learning}} outcome {{approach to}} teaching and a learning-oriented assessment are increasingly framing higher education. In an attempt to facilitate professors’ teaching activities, the TALOE (Time to Assess Learning Outcomes in E-learning) project has developed a <b>web</b> <b>tool</b> that aims to help trainers decide on the assessment methods to use in their online courses. Based on a conceptual model (ALOA) built upon Bloom’s revised taxonomy of learning objectives of the cognitive domain, the <b>web</b> <b>tool</b> automatically aligns learning outcomes stated by a user with recommended assessment methods. The <b>web</b> <b>tool</b> has been developed with the European Commission support within the Lifelong Learning Programme and it is publicly available. This paper presents the background and description of the tool {{and the results of}} the testing, where various stakeholders have provided feedback about the easiness and friendliness of the tool, as well as about the utility and quality of the recommendations it provides. Prospective of the <b>web</b> <b>tool,</b> limitations and strengths are highlighted in the paper.|$|R
