Gilmore Girls survived the merger, being {{selected}} as one of seven WB shows to be transferred for a new season, but it resulted in a significant change. In April that year, it was announced that Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel could not come to an agreement with The CW and would be leaving the show when their contracts expired that summer. Journalist Michael Ausiello said of the decision: [...] "The thought of Gilmore Girls heading into <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be its final season (and its first on a brand-new network) without its mama or her right-hand man is unfathomable."

2500|$|In brief, {{sensemaking}} {{is viewed}} more as [...] "a motivated, continuous {{effort to understand}} connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively", rather than the state of knowledge underlying situation awareness. Endsley points out that as an effortful process, sensemaking is actually considering {{a subset of the}} processes used to maintain situation awareness. In {{the vast majority of the}} cases, SA is instantaneous and effortless, proceeding from pattern recognition of key factors in the environment—"The speed of operations in activities such as sports, driving, flying and air traffic control practically prohibits such conscious deliberation in the majority of cases, but rather reserves it for the exceptions." [...] Endsley also points out that sensemaking is backward focused, forming reasons for past events, while situation awareness is typically forward looking, projecting <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> happen in order to inform effective decision processes.|$|E
2500|$|De Grey {{and other}} {{scientists}} in the general field {{have argued that the}} costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky et al. 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of Alzheimer's disease in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050. [...] "Consider <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> happen if we don't [...] Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ptolemy first {{proposes that}} it is not [...] "useless" [...] to create {{predictions}} of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> happen, even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in Cicero's text De Divinatione, in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they [...] offer no means of escape. Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject [...] "by which we gain full view of things human and divine", which, he argues, gives a better perception of [...] "what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament". He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; {{the same can be said}} of all philosophy, which concerns itself with [...] "greater advantages". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because [...] "foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes".|$|E

6000|$|SIR JOHN JERVIS had now {{arrived to}} take the command of the Mediterranean fleet.
