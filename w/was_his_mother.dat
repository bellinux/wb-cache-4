5|$|Manuel's {{death on}} 24 September 1180 left his 11-year-old son Alexios II Komnenos on the throne. Alexios was highly incompetent at the office, but it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> Maria of Antioch, and her Frankish {{background}} {{that made his}} regency unpopular. Eventually, Andronikos I Komnenos, a grandson of Alexios I, launched a revolt against his younger relative and managed to overthrow him in a violent coup d'état. Utilizing his good looks and his immense popularity with the army, he marched on to Constantinople in August 1182 and incited a massacre of the Latins. After eliminating his potential rivals, he had himself crowned as co-emperor in September 1183. He eliminated Alexios II, and took his 12-year-old wife Agnes of France for himself.|$|E

(It is not known whether the Seven Against Thebes figured in early epic.) As far as Oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at Thebes after the revelation that Iokaste <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children — markedly different from the tale known to us through tragedy (e.g. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and later mythological accounts.|$|E

25|$|In 1501, two papal bulls {{were issued}} {{concerning}} the child, Giovanni Borgia. In the first, he {{was recognized as}} Cesare's child from an affair before his marriage.

Lucrezia's name is not mentioned in either, and rumors that she <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> have never been proven. The second bull was kept secret for many years, and Giovanni was assumed to be Cesare's son. This is supported by the fact that in 1502 he became Duke of Camerino, one of Cesare's recent conquests, hence the natural inheritance of the Duke of Romagna's oldest son. Giovanni went to stay with Lucrezia in Ferrara after Alexander's death, where he was accepted as her half-brother.|$|E
