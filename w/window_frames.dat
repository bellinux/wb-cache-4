5|$|The {{main part}} of the {{detached}} building is two storeys high along with an attic and cellar. The building was based on a timber frame structure that partially survives although refaced in brick and affected by later extensions. It is mostly rendered and painted white or cream, with doors and <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> painted red or brown.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{is used in}} the {{construction}} of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles, poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers, fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets. In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making joists, roof trusses, roofing shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> floor boards, parquet flooring, panelling and cladding.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} in Merchants Street was {{designed}} {{so as to}} house eight shops, {{four on each side}} of the main doorway. Each shop has another room above, reached by an individual spiral staircase, which space was intended as a home for the owners. These rooms above the shops have a window each, forming eight square windows on the façade, one above each entrance of a shop. The windows are decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of the shops was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous <b>window</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|E

40|$|Study of <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> {{fabrication}} by {{injection moulding}} process {{was carried out}} {{with the aid of}} MoldflowÂ® software. Rice husk filled high-density polyethylene was used as the raw material. Solid and hollow designs (A 001 and A 002) were created to compare {{the pros and cons of}} each design. The investigations were carried out on flowing, packing, cooling and costing of injection moulded <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> At the end of the analysis, the most feasible design was selected to be further undergone stress analysis according to BS EN 14608 : 2004 and BS EN 14609 : 2004. Eventually, the mechanical properties were classified according to BS EN 13115 : 2001. The actual processing conditions of rice husk composite were approximated to softwood at Cross-WLF viscosity model due to unavailability of rice husk plastic composite (RHPC) rheology property. RHPC melt is generally shear thinning, meanings that the viscosity decreases with increasing of shear rates. From the analysis, <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> with hollow design is preferable, since hollow design has advantage of filling, packing, and cooling properties. The hollow design also costs less than solid design of <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> However, high injection pressure and clamping tonnage are unfavourable for hollow design. A 002 hollow design was selected as the most feasible <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> to be fabricated. Stress analysis was done to classify the <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> The analyses were carried out to determine racking and static torsion resistance. A 002 <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> mechanical strength is classified as Class 2 according to BS EN 13115 : 2001...|$|R
5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, the KR200 Kabrio {{model was}} released, {{featuring}} a cloth convertible top and fixed side <b>window</b> <b>frames.</b> This {{was followed by}} the KR201 Roadster without <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> using a folding cloth top, a windscreen, and removable side curtains. A Sport Roadster was later offered with no top and with the canopy fixed into place so that the driver would have to climb in and out {{at the top of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|Deep-set {{windows in}} {{rectilinear}} shapes, a Breuer trademark, were {{planned for the}} facade. The <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> were made of precast concrete. The building was the first Breuer-designed structure in the United States to use a precast concrete facade, {{and this was the}} first federal building to be built of precast concrete. The facade was designed to be load-bearing, with the panels on the second, third, and fourth floors designed to carry the weight of the building. The <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> on the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors were slightly thinner, because although they were not load-bearing they had to contain HVAC piping. The panels on the middle floors required the least amount of fabrication, according to architect Herbert Beckhard (an associate in Breuer's firm who helped design the building), as they did not need to bear as much load nor contain much piping. The windows do not meet {{at the corner of the}} concrete frame. Pipes from the I-395 tunnel (which runs below the building) run up through the building's walls and vent at the corners of the <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> dispersing automobile exhaust fumes high in the air. Each concrete unit is three feet (0.9 metres) thick and weighs almost 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes). The firm which supplied the <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> had no previous experience producing architectural concrete, but instead had supplied precast forms for bridges and parking garages.|$|E

25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the side <b>window</b> <b>frames.</b> This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E

25|$|Hypermediated: This form of {{remediation}} {{attempts to}} “refashion the older medium or media entirely, while still marking {{the presence of}} the older media and therefore maintaining a sense of multiplicity or hypermediacy” (p.46).

Hypermediated remediation is akin to “a mosaic in which we are simultaneously aware of the individual pieces and their new, in-appropriate setting” (p.47).|$|E
25|$|As a child, he was {{described}} as hyperactive, and after neighbors complained of hearing seven-year-old Puente beating on pots and <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> his mother sent him to 25-cent piano lessons. By the age of 10, he switched to percussion, drawing influence from jazz drummer Gene Krupa. He later created a song-and-dance duo with his sister Anna in the 1930s and intended to become a dancer, but an ankle tendon injury prevented him pursuing dance as a career. When the drummer in Machito's band was drafted to the army, Puente subsequently took his place.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Window</b> <b>Frame</b> - After Andrew [...] "vandalizes" [...] {{the glass}} window above {{everyone}}'s doors, everyone is {{taught how to}} replace the glass on the existing <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> Deen appeared to not pay attention, but he had in fact paid perfect attention, and easily passes. Cory destroys his <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> {{in the process of}} removing it, and fails as a result. Prior to this challenge, Matt had his helmet modified to include a mohawk by the show's crew in his honour (for passing so many challenges), and his streak of passing continues with this one. Angela fails, as her window glazing is rough in various areas. Simon finishes his window without incident, but he has trouble remounting his window, which has a hinge. That is termed a failure.|$|R
