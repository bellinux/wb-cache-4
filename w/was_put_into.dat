50|$|All {{of these}} linearized objects <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> {{envelopes}} that enable {{the client and}} server agents to coordinate their processing. In DDM architecture, these envelopes are called Data Stream Structures (DSS). Commands <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> a Request DSS (RQSDSS), replies <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> a Reply DSS (RPYDSS), and other objects <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> an Object DSS (OBJDSS). There can be only one command in a RQSDSS and only one reply in RPYDSS, but many objects, such as records, can <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> an OBJDSS. Further many OBJDSSes can be chained to a RQSDSS or a PRYDSS to accommodate as many objects as necessary A DSS consists of the total length of the DSS, a flag byte identifying the type of DSS, a request identifier, and the linearized objects in the DSS. The request identifier ties an RQSDSS with subsequent OBJDSSes from the client, such as the records to be loaded into a file by the Load File command. The request identifier also ties the RQSDSS from the client with a RPYDSS or the OBJDSSes from the server to the client.|$|R
