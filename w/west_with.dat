5|$|There {{has long}} been plans for Metrorail, the local heavy rail rapid transit system to be {{extended}} <b>west,</b> <b>with</b> two proposed lines terminating at Florida International University's main campus. This would ease traffic and parking problems at and around the main campus.|$|E
5|$|After Harrison's {{preliminary}} studies, {{it became}} clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end of the main site, aligned east to <b>west,</b> <b>with</b> a tower at the west end; the upper quadrangle, to the immediate west of the hall and aligned north to south, would have the Warden's Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end; steps would lead down from the upper quadrangle into the lower quadrangle, again aligned east to <b>west,</b> <b>with</b> the main entrance at the far east end of the lower quadrangle. The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street. The sub-committee recommended that Harrison's plans be adopted in January 1939, and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 – he had been abroad for much of the intervening period.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had more success.

The king fled <b>west</b> <b>with</b> the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E
