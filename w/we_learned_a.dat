The covers consist most part of pop songs in which the band transformed into a more symphonic oriented form. Lead vocalist Sharon den Adel stated that:“Our approach was to really make the cover a new Within Temptation song. So not going the easy way by using only a piano or an acoustic guitar for example, but really trying to put {{all the elements of}} a Within Temptation track in this new version. It was quite a challenge because we had only one week to get it right, while recording an original Within Temptation song can sometimes takes up half a year! But this pressure also gave us an creative boost and it was very rewarding to get it done in time each week. Also, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> lot from the in-depth analysis we needed to make on these hits, written by others, in combination with implementing our own sound and style in each new cover.

40|$|Object {{tracking}} {{is challenging}} as target objects often undergo drastic appearance changes over time. Recently, adaptive correlation filters {{have been successfully}} applied to object tracking. However, tracking algorithms relying on highly adaptive correlation filters are prone to drift due to noisy updates. Moreover, as these algorithms do not maintain long-term memory of target appearance, they cannot recover from tracking failures caused by heavy occlusion or target disappearance in the camera view. In this paper, <b>we</b> propose to <b>learn</b> multiple adaptive correlation filters with both long-term and short-term memory of target appearance for robust object tracking. First, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> kernelized correlation filter with <b>an</b> aggressive <b>learning</b> rate for locating target objects precisely. We {{take into account the}} appropriate size of surrounding context and the feature representations. Second, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> correlation filter over a feature pyramid centered at the estimated target position for predicting scale changes. Third, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> complementary correlation filter with <b>a</b> conservative <b>learning</b> rate to maintain long-term memory of target appearance. We use the output responses of this long-term filter to determine if tracking failure occurs. In the case of tracking failures, <b>we</b> apply <b>an</b> incrementally <b>learned</b> detector to recover the target position in a sliding window fashion. Extensive experimental results on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.

[...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan.

60|$|But in our {{particular}} case {{there was another}} perturbing factor. The sun, in its annual march north through the heavens, was increasing its declination. On the 19th parallel of north latitude {{in the middle of}} May the sun is nearly overhead. The angle of arc was between eighty-eight and eighty-nine degrees. Had it been ninety degrees it would have been straight overhead. It was on another day that <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> few things about taking the altitude of the almost perpendicular sun.

I, on the other hand, started in to draw the sun down to south-east and strayed away to the south-west. You see, we were teaching ourselves. As a result, at twenty-five minutes past twelve by the ship's time, I called twelve o'clock by the sun. Now this signified that we had changed our location on the face of the world by twenty- five minutes, which was equal to something like six degrees of longitude, or three hundred and fifty miles. This showed the Snark had travelled fifteen knots per hour for twenty-four consecutive hours--and we had never noticed it! It was absurd and grotesque. But Roscoe, still looking east, averred that it was not yet twelve o'clock. He was bent on giving us a twenty-knot clip. Then we began to train our sextants rather wildly all around the horizon, and wherever we looked, there was the sun, puzzlingly close to the sky-line, sometimes above it and sometimes below it. In one direction the sun was proclaiming morning, in another direction it was proclaiming afternoon. The sun was all right--we knew that; therefore we were all wrong. And the rest of the afternoon we spent in the cockpit reading up the matter in the books and finding out what was wrong. We missed the observation that day, but we didn't the next.
