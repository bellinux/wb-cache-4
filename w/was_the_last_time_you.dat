And despite boasting the musical dexterity of Status Quo, it's a short, sharp shock that dispatches its venom with a tireless guile." [...] Similarly, critic Roy Wilkinson of Select compared some songs favourably to The Stooges and early-Siouxsie and the Banshees. However, he noted that the band [...] " [...] intent on falling short of PJ 's black-bordered presence. When <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> heard the Yeovil delta blues sound enlivened by such Carry On Riffing-isms as 'I've rocketed to Uranus' ('Nothing') and 'When the kids scream, there is a racket/You've got a magnificent packet' ('Too Famous')?" ...|$|E
500|$|Up! Close and Personal {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. David Bianculli of New York City's Daily News wrote, [...] "After watching Britney Spears' [...] special last week, Twain's act will {{seem like an}} exercise in restraint. It'll also seem like someone singing, rather than lip-syncing." [...] Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant gave Up! Close & Personal a negative review. He found himself straining to hear Alison Krauss and Union Station, and asked, [...] "And when <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> tuned in to a star's special to hear the background singers?" [...] Furthermore, {{he would have preferred}} the band to duet with Twain, rather perform backup for her. Catlin also criticized Twain's decision to model the show after Presley's 68 Comeback Special, believing she did so with far less efficiency. [...] "Not only is she not Elvis, she's not even Alison", he concluded. Allmusic rated Up! Close and Personal three out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, {{if for no other}} reason than his persistence" [...] in the face of abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> could say that about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put it all on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked Raynor as the 24th greatest soldier in video games.|$|E

500|$|Snippets {{of voices}} between {{and over the}} music are another notable feature of the album. [...] During {{recording}} sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer {{a series of questions}} printed on flashcards. [...] The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as [...] "What's your favourite colour?" [...] and [...] "What's your favourite food?", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death). [...] Questions such as [...] "When <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> were violent?", followed immediately by [...] "Were you in the right?", were answered in the order they were presented. Roger [...] "The Hat" [...] Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. [...] Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied [...] "...give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock..." [...] When asked about death he responded [...] "live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me..." [...] Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: [...] "I've been mad for fucking years – absolutely years". [...] The band's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during [...] "Brain Damage" [...] and [...] "Speak to Me". [...] His second wife, Patricia [...] "Puddie" [...] Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the [...] "geezer" [...] who was [...] "cruisin' for a bruisin used in the segue between [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them", and the words [...] "I never said I was frightened of dying" [...] heard halfway through [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people may}} be better [...] "lie detectors" [...] than others, better able to {{distinguish}} a lie by facial expression, cadence of speech, certain movements, consistency, and other methods. According to David J. Lieberman, PhD, in Never Be Lied to Again: How to Get the Truth in Five Minutes or Less in Any Conversation or Situation, these methods can be learned. Some methods of questioning {{may be more likely}} to elicit the truth, for instance: [...] "When <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> smoked marijuana?" [...] (a leading question) is more likely to get a truthful answer than [...] "Do you smoke pot?" [...] Asking the question most likely to get the information you want is a skill and can be learned. Avoiding vague questioning will help avoid lies of omission or vagueness.|$|E
