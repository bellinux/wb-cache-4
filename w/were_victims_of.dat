5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{formations}} {{were also}} created but were mostly eroded away following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny affected the entire {{western part of}} what would become North America starting about 70million to 50million years ago. This event helped to build the Rocky Mountains {{and in the process}} closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> this uplift. The Colorado Plateaus were uplifted 16million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus, each separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own uplift rate. The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.|$|E

5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further effected by fungal infections. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|E
