60|$|On Saturday {{he drove}} over to Hintock, and assured her with mysterious pacifications {{that in a}} day or two she might expect to receive some assuring news. So it turned out. <b>When</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> came there was a letter for Grace from her father. It arrived at seven o'clock, the usual time at which the toddling postman passed by Hintock; at eight Grace awoke, having slept an hour or two for a wonder, and Mrs. Melbury brought up the letter.|$|E
60|$|It {{is not to}} be {{supposed}} that Mr Mason contemplated the probable renewal of hostilities without great anxiety. For himself, we need scarcely say, he had no fears, but his heart sank when he thought of his gentle Alice falling into the hands of savages. As the night passed away without any alarms, his anxiety began to subside, and <b>when</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> dawned, he lay down on a couch to snatch a few hours' repose before the labours of the day began.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{was very}} {{glad to hear that}} there was no chance of meeting Grimes again, though he was a little sorry for him, {{considering}} that he used sometimes to give him the leavings of the beer: but he determined {{to be a very good}} boy all Saturday; and he was; for he never frightened one crab, nor tickled any live corals, nor put stones into the sea anemones' mouths, to make them fancy they had got a dinner; and <b>when</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> came, sure enough, MRS. DOASYOUWOULDBEDONEBY came too. Whereat all the little children began dancing and clapping their hands, and Tom danced too with all his might.|$|E
60|$|The week {{passed without}} any further {{communication}} with the 'Hall,' as Arthur was evidently fearful that we might 'wear out our welcome'; but <b>when,</b> on <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> we were setting out for church, I gladly agreed to his proposal to go round and enquire after the Earl, who {{was said to be}} unwell.|$|R
60|$|Old Mr. Pringle never stirred {{beyond his}} parlour, and was {{invisible}} to every one, except his housekeeper and doctor, but his tall, square, curtained pew was jealously locked up, {{and was a}} grievance to the vicar, who having been foiled in several attempts, was meditating a fresh one, if, as he told his wife, he could bring his churchwarden up to the scratch, <b>when</b> one <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> the congregation was electrified {{by the sound of}} a creak and a shake, and beheld a stout hale sunburnt gentleman, fighting with the disused door, and finally gaining the victory by strength of hand, admitting himself and a boy among the dust and the cobwebs.|$|R

In mid-February 1942, she headed south in the escort for a convoy to Pago Pago, Samoa, then joined [...] in laying a protective mine field off Tutuila. At the end of March the two minelayers shifted to the Fiji Islands, to lay a minefield in Nadi waters 7-14 April.

40|$|Time {{and again}} {{throughout}} scripture {{we are told}} {{that we live in a}} broken world where we are guaranteed to experience hardship, pain, and trial. In the face of this sobering truth, there is genuine hope to be found in the promises of God. Jesus did not wear blinders to the suffering of humanity two thousand years ago. He healed the sick and uplifted the downtrodden. He met people in the midst of their darkest hours of grief and sickness. So too does God abide with us now. We have been given the promise that Jesus is with us always, to the end of the age. 1 In addition to that abiding present hope, Jesus gave us the hope of an eschatological kingdom of God. Such a vision is impossible for us to comprehend fully. There is however a foretaste of that kingdom we can share with all of our brothers and sisters in Christ. We have the prayer Jesus gave us which has the power to both unify all Christians and grant us a glimpse of the eschaton. That prayer is the Lord’s Prayer. 2 Prayer – broadly speaking – is one of the single greatest unifying activities of Christians, and consequentially, one of the most compelling motivators for ecumenical discussion. Even when we cannot agree on the finer points of theological interpretation, when the structures of our various church bodies seem foreign and nonsensical, and <b>when</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> worshi...|$|E
5000|$|The {{arrival of}} Hurst {{certainly}} boosted season ticket sales and a record takings were banked before a ball was kicked {{prior to the}} start of the 1972-73 season. It proved that the public of Stoke-on-Trent were now right behind the team but despite high hopes and expectations, the [...] "Potters" [...] started the new campaign rather poorly and found themselves in the bottom six. Stoke's immediate plans were hit <b>when</b> on the <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> of 22 October 1972 after visiting the Victoria Ground for treatment Gordon Banks crashed his car on the way home and effectively ended his career. Such was the scale of Banks' presence his condition was headline news. Realising that Banks was to be out of action for quite some time Waddington moved in for Scotland international Bobby Clark, but the deal fell through as he failed to impress the Stoke directors. Mike McDonald was signed instead from Clydebank as cover for John Farmer after it was learnt that Banks had lost an eye and would never play competitive football again.|$|R
