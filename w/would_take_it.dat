5|$|After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell {{up for all}} {{the same}} classes he had. Smith would do all {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham. When he had a test, he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> twice and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the music for}} the film, Snow {{had a couple of}} months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked {{the first time in the}} history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|Captain Lawrence {{realised}} {{that his}} ship's speed <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> past Shannon {{and ordered a}} 'pilot's luff'. This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make the sails shiver and reduce the ship's speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while one round shot demolished Shannons ship's bell.|$|E
5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.|$|E

25|$|It {{arrived at}} Jupiter on 8 February 1992 for a {{swing-by}} maneuver that increased its inclination to the ecliptic by 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flight path southward {{and away from}} the ecliptic plane. This put it into a final orbit around the Sun that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> past the Sun's north and south poles.|$|E
25|$|The group got {{considerable}} publicity through word {{of mouth}} and articles in vernacular newspapers. This publicity helped it increase its membership. By {{the second year of}} its formation, 100 to 150 women had joined the group, {{and by the end of}} the third year it had more than 300 members. By this time, the terrace of seven founders could no longer accommodate the members and the ingredients, so the kneaded flour was distributed among the members who <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> to their homes and make papads. The papads were brought back for weighing and packaging.|$|E

But when Argentina join the Rugby Championship the tournament was cancelled which meant that with the same schedule, New Zealand again would be the winners by 41 points over South Africa. They <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> again in 2013–14 with Spain being {{the first team to}} be relegated after finishing last during that season with Japan replacing them.|$|E

25|$|After 1300, Jews {{suffered}} more {{discrimination and}} persecution in Christian Europe. As Catholics were forbidden {{by the church}} to loan money for interest, some Jews became prominent moneylenders. Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having such a class of people who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication. As a result, the money trade of western Europe became a specialty of the Jews. But, in almost every instance when Jews acquired large amounts through banking transactions, during their lives or upon their deaths, the king <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> over. Jews became imperial servi cameræ, {{the property of the}} King, who might present them and their possessions to princes or cities.|$|E
25|$|The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was {{conceived}} {{as part of}} a network of canals which would allow coal from the Dudley Canal and the Stourbridge Canal to reach Oxford and London, without having to use the Birmingham canals, the management of which was seen as high-handed. An Act was passed on 28 March 1793 {{for the construction of a}} canal from a junction with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal in Kings Norton to Stratford-upon-Avon. The Canal Company was empowered to raise £120,000 by issuing shares and an additional £60,000 if required. The route <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> close to Warwick and Birmingham Canal at Lapworth, but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it, or with the River Avon at Stratford. Negotiations started with the Warwick and Birmingham, and to second act was obtained on 19 May 1795, to allow a connecting link to be built, despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company.|$|E
25|$|New Horizons {{crossed the}} orbit of Saturn on June 8, 2008, and Uranus on March 18, 2011. After astronomers {{announced}} the discovery of two new moons in the Pluto system, Kerberos and Styx, mission planners started contemplating {{the possibility of the}} probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons. A study based on 18 months of computer simulations, Earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the Pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3% on the probe's scheduled course. If the hazard increased, New Horizons could have used one of two possible contingency plans, the so-called SHBOTs (Safe Haven by Other Trajectories): the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected, or, it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> just 3000km from the surface of Pluto where it was expected that the atmospheric drag would clean the surrounding space of possible debris.|$|E

25|$|Once {{they left}} home these armies and fleets {{had to be}} supplied, not only with food and {{clothing}} for the men but also forage for the horses which gave them mobility and were fitting to their Station. Yet if armies of the seventh and eighth centuries were accompanied by servants and a supply train of lesser free men, Alfred found these arrangements insufficient to defeat the Vikings. One of his reforms, if {{he was responsible for}} them, was to divide his military resources into three. One part manned the burhs and found the permanent garrisons which would make it impossible for the Danes to overrun Wessex, although they would also take to the field when extra soldiers were needed. The remaining two <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> in turns to serve. They were allocated a fixed term of Service and brought the necessary provisions with them. This arrangement did not always function perfectly. On one occasion a division on Service went home in the middle of blockading a Danish army on Thorney Island, its provisions consumed and its term expired, before the king came to relieve them. This method of division and rotation remained in force right up to 1066. In 917, when armies from Wessex and Mercia were in the field from early April until November, one division went home and another took over. Again, in 1052 when Edward's fleet was waiting at Sandwich to intercept Godwine's return, the ships returned to London to take on new earls and crews. The importance of supply, vital to military success, was appreciated even if it was taken for granted and features only incidentally in the sources.|$|E

500|$|All these {{satellites}} {{have observed}} the Sun {{from the plane}} of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first travelled to Jupiter, to [...] "slingshot" [...] into an orbit that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> far above {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's release, it was {{reported}} that the game's font-size had been formatted {{in such a way as}} to make in-game text difficult to read on standard definition televisions. Representatives from BioWare stated that the issue was a design choice instead of a bug. Mark Barlet, president of the website AbleGamers, which advocates for making games more accessible to the disabled, observed that [...] "It's not just the size of the text of Mass Effect 2 that is the problem, it's the coloring of the text" [...] that is the problem. After investigating the complaints further, BioWare released a statement acknowledging that [...] "on some standard definition TVs the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to read", and concluded that they were unable to resolve it through a title update. However, they stated that they <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> into consideration for future games.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Jackson's 1996 film The Frighteners, Universal Pictures was {{impressed}} with Jackson's dailies and early visual effects footage. The studio was adamant to work with Jackson on his next project and, in late 1995, offered him the chance to direct a remake of the 1954 film Creature from the Black Lagoon. He turned down the offer, but Universal became aware of Jackson's obsession with King Kong and subsequently offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct that remake. The studio did not have to worry of lawsuits concerning the film rights from RKO Pictures (the studio behind the 1933 film) because the King Kong character is held in the public domain. Jackson initially turned down the King Kong offer, but he [...] "quickly became disturbed by the fact that someone else <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> over," [...] Jackson continued, [...] "and make it into a terrible film; that haunted me and I eventually said yes to Universal." ...|$|E
