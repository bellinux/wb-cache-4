5|$|Though Fox was {{initially}} worried about an entire episode {{set in the}} other universe, they soon came to appreciate the storyline. The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes.

Brezhnev rejected Kosygin's bid for producing more consumer goods during the Tenth Five-Year Plan. Because of it the total volume of consumer goods in industrial production only stood at 26 percent. Kosygin's son-in-law notes that Kosygin was furious with the decision, and proclaimed increased defence expenditure would become the Soviet Union's [...] "complete ruin". The plan was less ambitious than its predecessors, with targets of national industrial growth no higher than <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the world had already achieved.

500|$|Feedforward processing: The {{cerebellum}} {{differs from}} most {{other parts of}} the brain (especially the cerebral cortex) in that the signal processing is almost entirely feedforward—that is, signals move unidirectionally through the system from input to output, with very little recurrent internal transmission. The small amount of recurrence that does exist consists of mutual inhibition; there are no mutually excitatory circuits. This feedforward mode of operation means that the cerebellum, in contrast to the cerebral cortex, cannot generate self-sustaining patterns of neural activity. Signals enter the circuit, are processed by each stage in sequential order, and then leave. As Eccles, Ito, and Szentágothai wrote, [...] "This elimination in the design of all possibility of reverberatory chains of neuronal excitation is undoubtedly a great advantage in the performance of the cerebellum as a computer, because <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the nervous system requires from the cerebellum is presumably not some output expressing the operation of complex reverberatory circuits in the cerebellum but rather a quick and clear response to the input of any particular set of information." ...|$|E

Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor.

[...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ...

[...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted.

After all, only buddies capable of putting their differences aside could craft the soaring, majestic [...] "Tug of War," [...] where Brodsky's wide-reaching pipes mesh brilliantly with KK's ace musicianship". He continues to say that [...] "the disc shifts from roaring, expansive rockers like [...] "Bicycle Song" [...] to crunching anthems like [...] "Ted Nugent" [...] and on to lilting, near-ballads like [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] with inexplicable ease". Moore writes that [...] "The Scope" [...] "encapsulates <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the album will sound like. It starts out sounding rather crunchy and smooths out as the album progresses, providing a good contrasting effect that runs throughout the album". Moore, however, writes that [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] is [...] "only mediocre. It's the only song on the album over five minutes long. Playing slow just isn't this band's forte, although {{they have the ability}} to write poignant lyrics". Similarly, a ScenePointBlank review states that [...] "Cadence for a Rainy Day" [...] and [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] "often diverge and lead the listener off-course".|$|E
