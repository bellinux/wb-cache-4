40|$|General Information: Power fuses {{shall be}} {{utilized}} to provide primarily {{short circuit protection}} for cables and transformers. The fuse rating shall be selected to appropriately provide 125 percent of the transformers full-load rating continuously, sustain no damage from magnetizing in-rush currents, and provide protection against thermal damage from internal or secondary faults. The interrupting rating shall be sufficient to quickly and safely interrupt fault currents and prevent extensive damage to equipment. Expulsion Type Power Fuses: The quality of components is to be that represented by: S & C Electric type SM- 5 S or SM- 5 SS Fuses shall be of the solid-material type and shall utilize refill-unit-and-holder or fuse-unit-andend-fitting construction <b>with</b> readily <b>replaceable</b> <b>refill</b> unit or fuse unit. Disconnect style mountings shall be used for switchgear rated up through 600 MVA at 13. 8 kV. Non-disconnect style mountings for power fuses shall be used only where higher ratings are required. Fusible elements shall be non-aging and non-damageable construction. Melting time-current characteristics shall be permanently accurate with a maximum total tolerance of 10 % in terms of current. Power fuses shall be capable of detecting and interrupting down to minimum melting current, under all realistic conditions of line-to-line or line-to-ground voltage, and shall be capable of handling {{the full range of}} transient recovery voltage severity associated with these faults. All arcing accompanying power fuse operation shall be contained within the fuse, and any arc products and gases evolved during fuse operation shall be vented through exhaust control devices that shall effectively control fuse exhaust. Blown-fuse indicators shall provide visible evidence of fuse operation while installed in the fuse mounting. Expulsion-type power fuses shall be 13. 8 KV, E- rated, with an Interrupting Rating (kA sym) o...|$|R
