5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response,</b> {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E
25|$|After Emperor Charles's {{death on}} 20 October, Frederick quickly {{resolved}} to strike first; on 8 November {{he ordered the}} mobilization of the Prussian army, and on 11 December he issued an ultimatum to Maria Theresa demanding the surrender of Silesia. In return, he promised to acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction and to give his vote as elector of Brandenburg in the imperial election to Maria Theresa's husband, Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine. Not <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response,</b> he then led his troops across the lightly defended Silesian frontier on 16 December 1740, beginning the First Silesian War.|$|E

500|$|Gibbes {{was working}} as a {{salesman}} when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 2February 1940. He exaggerated his height, which was below the minimum requirement, to gain entrance. In a 1990 interview, he related that he had undertaken flying lessons at his own expense prior to enlisting, but [...] "when war was declared, I thought I'd wait for King George to pay for the rest". He further recalled that he applied to join the Royal Australian Navy at the same time, but was still <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response.</b> After completing flying training at Mascot and Richmond, New South Wales, and Point Cook, Victoria, Gibbes was commissioned a pilot officer on 28June 1940. His initial posting was to No.23 Squadron, which operated CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons out of Archerfield, Queensland. [...] He was promoted to flying officer on 26December 1940.|$|E
500|$|In January 1925, while {{wintering}} in Schruns, Austria, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> from query letters {{written to}} friends and publishers in America, Hemingway submitted the story {{to be published in}} his friend Ernest Walsh's newly established literary magazine This Quarter. Walsh bought it for 1,000 French francs, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction. On October5, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York. The last story in the volume was the two-part [...] "Big Two-Hearted River". The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and [...] (1987). The fragment Hemingway cut was published posthumously as a separate short story titled [...] "On Writing" [...] in 1972 in The Nick Adams Stories.|$|E
500|$|On January21 Hemingway {{chartered}} a sightseeing {{flight of}} the Congo Basin as a late Christmas present to Mary; two days later, {{on their way to}} photograph Murchison Falls from the air, the plane hit an abandoned utility pole and crashed, with the passengers sustaining minor injuries. That night they camped in the bush <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to their distress call. The crash site was seen by a passing airliner that reported no survivors, and the news of Hemingway's death was telegraphed around the world. [...] The next day they were found and picked up by a bush pilot, but his de Havilland caught fire during take-off, crashed and exploded, which left Hemingway with a concussion, scalp wound, double-vision, intermittent hearing in his left ear, a crushed vertebra, ruptured liver, spleen and kidney, and burns. The explosion burned their passports, [...] "thirty rolls of exposed film, three pairs of Ernest's bifocals, all of their money, and their $15,000 letter of credit." [...] The group traveled to Entebbe by road, where journalists from around the world had gathered to report his death. On January26 Hemingway briefed and joked with the reporters, and spent the next few weeks in Nairobi recuperating and reading his obituaries. During his recuperation Hemingway immediately prepared the piece for Look. The magazine paid him an additional $20,000 for an exclusive about the plane crashes. Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that the piece, [...] "ran for twenty magazine pages spread out over two issues", with the first issue bearing a publication date of 26January.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, {{producers}} Jon and Peter Shapiro {{created a}} 2D IMAX concert film titled All Access, which featured live performances of several musicians. [...] Due {{to the difficulty}} of using conventional IMAX film stock that had to be replaced every three minutes of shooting, the Shapiros wanted to use digital technology for their next project, which could easily be upscaled to the IMAX format without loss of quality. [...] Noting how 3D films out-performed 2D films, they also wanted their next project to be in the IMAX 3D format. [...] While looking for a new digital 3D technology medium, the Shapiros met producer Steve Schklair, founder of Cobalt Entertainment in 2000. Schklair had recently developed a digital 3D filming technique known as [...] "active depth cut", which allowed for smooth cuts between shots that would normally not line up when filmed in 3D. This was done using motion control photography and real-time image processing to create a realistic 3D experience without subjecting the viewer to excessive motion sickness or eye strain. It was intended to be an inexpensive and effective way to shoot live events such as concerts or sports. With the help of John and David Modell, former owners of the Baltimore Ravens American football team, the digital 3D technology was tested at several National Football League (NFL) games in the 2003 season, including Super Bowl XXXVIII. Cobalt showed the footage to the NFL, hoping to create an NFL-based 3D IMAX film. While <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response,</b> the Shapiros proposed the idea of creating a 3D concert film for IMAX theaters. Although All Access had showcased several artists, the Shapiros now wanted to focus on a single act, and being U2 fans, suggested the band as a potential subject. Schklair felt U2 would be a good choice for the film due to their large concert setups and their constant movement while performing, both of which would provide good depth of field for 3D effects.|$|E
2500|$|On August 9, 1610, {{tired of}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> from Powhatan, West sent George Percy with 70 men {{to attack the}} Paspahegh capital, burning the houses and cutting down their cornfields. They killed 65 to 75, and {{captured}} one of Wowinchopunk's wives and her children. Returning downstream, the English threw the children overboard and shot out [...] "their Braynes in the water". The queen was put to the sword in Jamestown. The Paspahegh never recovered from this attack and abandoned their town. Another small force sent with Samuel Argall against the Warraskoyaks found that they had already fled, but he destroyed their abandoned village and cornfields as well. This event triggered the first Anglo-Powhatan War.|$|E

60|$|While the {{conversation}} was thus going on, to Middleton's astonishment there came {{a knock at the}} door of the room, and, without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>response,</b> it was opened, and there appeared at it the same young woman whom he had already met. She came in with perfect freedom and familiarity, and was received quietly by the old gentleman; who, however, by his manner towards Middleton, indicated that he was now to take his leave. He did so, after settling the hour at which the excursion of the next day was to take place. This arranged, he departed, with much to think of, and a light glimmering through the confused labyrinth of thoughts which had been unilluminated hitherto.|$|E
