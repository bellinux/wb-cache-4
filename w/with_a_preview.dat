5|$|The {{night after}} WrestleMania, Orton demanded a rematch, {{threatening}} Linda McMahon (Vince's wife) {{as well as}} their grandchildren. McMahon did not grant him the rematch but scheduled a six-man tag team match for the pay-per-view Backlash between Triple H and Shane and Vince McMahon and The Legacy, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>preview</b> that evening between Vince and Orton. However, Raw's general manager at that time, Vickie Guerrero, made their six-man tag team match a WWE Championship match. The stipulation was that if Triple H's team won, he retained the championship, while if The Legacy won, Orton would win the title. As the singles match progressed, Shane and Triple H came to Vince's aid, causing both Rhodes and DiBiase to interfere until a returning Batista appeared and cleared the ring; McMahon then announced that Batista was to replace him in the match at Backlash. At the event, Orton won by pinning Triple H after an RKO and a running punt, leaving Triple H hospitalized according to the storyline. In spite of Triple H's absence, Shane McMahon continued his feud with the group, leading to another match between him and Orton on Raw. After the original match ended in a no contest due to interference, Rhodes and DiBiase won singles matches to be entered into a handicap match with all of The Legacy facing Shane later that night. This match was used to write him out of the storyline, as The Legacy members used the steel ring steps to shatter his ankle.|$|E

500|$|The song's melody oscillates {{over the}} chords of C major and C diminished, a chord favoured by Harrison in his Indian music-inspired {{compositions}} for the Beatles.
