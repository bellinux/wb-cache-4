The {{aspect of the}} machine plays that posterity knows most about is their economics, as this was <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> prompter Downes most vividly recalled when he wrote his Roscius Anglicanus in 1708. The scenery alone for Psyche cost more than £800, which {{can be related to}} the entire annual box office takings for the company of £10,000. Ticket prices for these performances would be raised to up to four times normal. Both Psyche and The Tempest actually complained of the production costs in their epilogues, hinting pointedly that the public ought to reward the [...] "poor players" [...] for their risk-taking and for offering splendours that had so far been reserved for royal masques: ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} took place at various {{locations}} in and around New York City in June 2009. In creating the visual effects for the series, the company turned to Brooklyn-based effects company Brainstorm Digital. Says Glenn Allen, visual effects producer for Boardwalk Empire and co-founder of Brainstorm, [...] "It's our most complex job to date. Everything is HD now, {{so we have to}} treat it like a feature film." [...] "Anytime you get to work on a period piece, it's more fun," [...] comments visual effects artist Chris [...] "Pinkus" [...] Wesselman, who used archival photographs, postcards, and architectural plans to recreate the Atlantic City boardwalks as accurately as possible. [...] "We got to explore <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Atlantic City was really like. The piers were one of the toughest parts because every summer they would change – new houses, new advertisements." [...] It took two months for the firm to complete all the visual effects {{for the pilot}}.|$|E

I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I {{wanted it to be}} in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E

Scott of The New York Times was not {{impressed}} with Reeves' performance, commenting that [...] "even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, {{much as he}} did back when we knew him as Neo." [...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a B minus and wrote, [...] "It's a decent enough stab at being <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> movie was to its time, following the same basic plot, full of respectful references to its model, updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson". Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was [...] "musty and derivative" [...] and thought its only bright spot was 10-year-old Jaden Smith's [...] "engaging, lively performance".|$|E
2500|$|Love was a conceit made petty by the sonnet writer {{stuck in}} {{revolution}} around one archetypal subject. The writer's world was that {{subject and the}} world was there to profess the supremacy of her beauty. [...] According to Klein, this takes the subject {{into the realm of}} imagination. Shakespeare grounds his subject in reality using the following lines of Sonnet 59:O, that record could with a backward look,Even of five hundred courses of the Sun,Show me your image in some antique book,Since mind at first in character was done!That I might see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> world could sayTo this composed wonder of your frame. Shakespeare uses his own education about the past to coolly reason his subject's beauty out of emotional speculation. [...] In essence he has researched the beauty of antiquity and found:O, sure I am of the wits of former daysTo subjects worse have given admiring praise.|$|E
2500|$|Darius sends {{a secret}} message in ancient runes to MacLeod in Seacouver, Washington {{asking him to}} protect Victor Paulus, another protégé of his, from Grayson. MacLeod tells Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch) Darius' legend: two {{thousand}} [...] years old, an ancient general and Grayson was his second-in-command. Fifteen hundred years ago, Darius could have led his armies across Europe and ruled for a thousand years, but he turned his armies back to become a peacemaker and Grayson felt betrayed. MacLeod then recounts, [...] "The legend has it Darius killed a holy man {{at the gates of}} Paris. The oldest living Immortal at that time. And suddenly he changed. He turned his back on war." [...] Richie rationalizes that the holy man's Quickening went to Darius and made him benevolent, the only known example of a Light Quickening. However, a deleted line from the script has MacLeod say: [...] "Maybe <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> One told him finally made sense to Darius", suggesting an intellectual realization of the horrors of war rather than the overwhelming positive power of the holy man's Quickening.|$|E

2500|$|The {{running backs}} coach for Vanderbilt before {{accepting}} the head coaching position at Oklahoma in 1932, Lewie Hardage played football {{as well as}} baseball for the Commodores. During his tenure at OU, he developed a lightweight football uniform consisting of foamed rubber head gear, knee pads and shin guards along with pants that ended three inches above the knee. This gear weighed approximately eight pounds, half of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> style had weighed. He also built OU's fastest all-weather football field in his time. For much of his tenure at OU, Hardage suffered from sickness that resulted from accidentally swallowing a poison tablet his mistook for a headache tablet. Only 12 players attended spring practice in 1932, but running back Bill Pansze kept the Sooners up 3-0 {{for the first half}} of the season. A knee injury in the Texas game took Pansze out for the remainder of the season and severely slowed the OU running game. [...] "The same wolves who had harassed Ad Lindsey, began to yip at Hardage's heels" [...] because of the Sooners' poor running and blocking. Hardage was fired as head coach of the Sooners after the 1934 season. His final record at OU was 11-12-4.|$|E
