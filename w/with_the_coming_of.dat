5|$|Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh {{had gained}} {{sufficient}} popularity over its run of 20 Merry-go-Round episodes {{to be given}} its own 39-week series beginning in January 1947. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> peace, the supposed RAF station became a civil airport, and the show continued much as before, written by and starring Horne and Murdoch, with Sam Costa. Maurice Denham—described by Murdoch as a vocal chameleon—joined the cast and played over 60 roles. The programme became popular, with audiences of 20 million, and ran for four series until September 1950.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> night, most of {{the crowd}} that had {{accompanied}} the storming of the palace earlier that day departed, intending to resume looting the next day. In the meantime, Alexios III, who resided in the Blachernae Palace in the city's northwestern corner, rallied for a counter-strike. A small force was dispatched with boats around the city's peninsula to the Hodegetria Monastery north of the Great Palace. It was led by the emperor's son-in-law Alexios Palaiologos, who at that point was likely regarded as his heir-apparent, and quickly made contact with the Varangians who had held out in the palace's northern parts.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> {{the war and}} {{construction}} of the ALCAN Highway, which connected to the Richardson south of Big Delta, road traffic waned further. The ferry crossing {{was replaced by a}} wooden bridge, and later, a larger steel bridge was constructed downriver. This caused rerouting of the highway away from the roadhouse, drawing off traffic and travelers. Wallen operated the roadhouse through the 1940s and early 1950s, although in later years guests were by invitation only. John Hajdukovich died in 1965, and Rika Wallen died four years later in 1969.|$|E
5|$|During the Triassic {{period of}} some 251–199.6Ma, the Indian subcontinent {{was part of}} a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea. Despite its {{position}} within a high-latitude belt at 55–75°S—latitudes now occupied by parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35°N—India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons. India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana, a process beginning some 550–500Ma. During the Late Paleozoic, Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator, where the Indian craton (stable continental crust) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-biomass ecosystems. This is underscored by India's vast coal reserves—much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence—the fourth-largest reserves in the world. During the Mesozoic, the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the Carboniferous, global cooling stoked extensive glaciation, which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the Permian.|$|E
5|$|No rivers or streams {{ran into}} the sound but note that early maps {{conflict}} and show that the River Cadoxton, originating from feeder brooks meeting at Michaelston-le-pit between Ely, Leckwith and Wenvoe to the north-east, passed through Dinas Powys and Sully Moors and bypassed the Barry shoreline to meet the sea near Cold Knap Point before decades later, Cold Knap promenade and Watchtower Bay was developed. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the docks, the River Cadoxton was re-routed from Sully moors through what was later to become the Supplies Reserve Depôt (SRD) and later still, the chemical complexes in the area, to discharge south-east of the dock's south-east breakwater at the Bendricks. For many years after the last war, with {{the dissolution of the}} SRD and coming of the chemical works, effluent discharge from some of them, was carried along the river to the sea and turned the water white in colour and it gave off a pungent effervescent odour until bylaws brought this pollution to an end and gradually the hitherto white shoreline at that area, returned to its normal sandstone colour.|$|E

5|$|Temple-building in Egypt {{continued}} {{despite the}} nation's decline and ultimate loss of independence to the Roman Empire in 30BC. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Christianity, traditional Egyptian religion faced increasing persecution, and temple cults died {{out during the}} fourth through sixth centuries CE. For centuries, the ancient buildings suffered destruction and neglect. At {{the start of the}} nineteenth century, a wave of interest in ancient Egypt swept Europe, giving rise to the discipline of Egyptology and drawing increasing numbers of visitors to the civilization's remains. Dozens of temples survive today, and some have become world-famous tourist attractions that contribute significantly to the modern Egyptian economy. Egyptologists continue to study the surviving temples and the remains of destroyed ones as invaluable sources of information about ancient Egyptian society.|$|E
5|$|The 5th century saw the {{withdrawal}} of Imperial Roman support from Britain, and the succeeding centuries, the Dark Ages, witnessed {{the emergence of a}} national identity and of kingdoms. The area which would become the Rhondda lay within Glywysing, an area that incorporated the modern area of Glamorgan, ruled by a dynasty founded by Glywys. This dynasty was later replaced by another founded by Meurig ap Tewdrig whose descendant Morgan ap Owain would give Glamorgan its Welsh name Morgannwg. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the Norman overlords after the 1066 Battle of Hastings, south-east Wales was divided into five cantrefi. The Rhondda lay within Penychen, a narrow strip running between modern day Glyn Neath and the coast between Cardiff and Aberthaw. Each cantref was further divided into commotes, with Penychen made up of five such commotes, one being Glynrhondda.|$|E
5|$|The attack tapered off <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> daylight, {{but that}} night it resumed. The North Koreans struck {{repeatedly}} at the defense line. This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September. The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops. Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve was down to six men. When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12:00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{improvements}} to the river were made between the 1540s and the 1570s, when Arundel became a port, and navigation up to Pallingham was improved, but barges had difficulty negotiating the flash locks that were installed. The work {{was carried out by}} Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, who made the upper section toll-free. Harbour commissioners managed the lower river from Arundel to the sea from 1732, and major improvements to keep the estuary free from silt were sanctioned by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the railways and changes in coastal shipping, Littlehampton superseded Arundel as the port of the Arun, and the Littlehampton harbour commissioners are still responsible for the river up to Arundel, collecting tolls for its use.|$|E
5|$|The flame robin mostly breeds in {{and around}} the Great Dividing Range, the Tasmanian {{highlands}} and islands in Bass Strait. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> cooler autumn weather, most birds disperse to lower and warmer areas, some travelling as far as eastern South Australia, southern Queensland, or (in the case of some Tasmanian birds) across Bass Strait to Victoria. Birds breeding in the warmer climates north of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales tend to retain their highland territories all year round. Outside the breeding season, birds may congregate in loose flocks, but they are most usually encountered throughout the year singly or in pairs, the latter more commonly in breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The saga states that, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> spring, Hákon {{ordered the}} {{preparation}} of Óspakr-Hákon's fleet. While preparations were under way Óláfr came to the king at Bergen, and reported the unrest in the Isles, noting that Alan had assembled a powerful army and was causing unrest in the region. When the fleet left Norway for Orkney, Óláfr accompanied it on-board Páll Bálkason's ship. When the fleet reached Orkney, several ship-commanders sailed to Skye, where they defeated a certain Þórkell Þórmóðsson in a sea-battle. The fleet then united at Islay, and was strengthened by Óspakr-Hákon's brothers and their followers, and swelled in size to 80 ships. The fleet then sailed south and around the Mull of Kintyre to Bute, where the force invaded the island and took the castle whilst suffering heavy casualties. The fleet then sailed to Kintyre, and Óspakr-Hákon fell ill and died. The Chronicle of Mann, however, specifically states that Óspakr-Hákon {{was struck by a}} stone and killed, and later buried on Iona.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} constructed, Archway Road {{went through}} countryside with few buildings - though by 1828 the Woodman pub {{at the junction}} with Muswell Hill Road, and the now demolished Wellington pub at the junction with North Hill provided refreshments to travellers; however, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the railways in 1867 ribbon development started along the road, including the Camra Heritage listed Winchester Tavern with the distinctive attached parade of shops and house with deep arched eaves built by the Imperial Property Investment Co in 1881. At {{the northern end of}} Archway Road, the road re-intersects with the traditional Great North Road route (at this point called North Hill). The roads almost immediately re-diverge, with the Great North Road route heading north as the A1000 towards Finchley, Whetstone and Barnet and the A1 heading west as Aylmer Road.|$|E

It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system. The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 (I‑75).|$|E
5|$|A church {{building}} had existed {{on the site}} since 1280. During this time, a small chapel stood on the site to serve the local townships of Oldham, Chadderton, Royton and Crompton. This was later replaced by an Early English Gothic church in the 15th century. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the Industrial Revolution, the population of Oldham increased at a rapid rate (from under 2,000 in 1714, to over 32,000 by 1831). The rapid growth of the local population warranted that the building be rebuilt into the current structure. Though the budget was originally agreed at £5,000, the final cost of building was £30,000, one third of which was spent on the crypt structure. Alternative designs by Sir Charles Barry, the designer of the Palace of Westminster, although now regarded by some as superior, were rejected. The Church, of the Anglican denomination, is in active use for worship, and forms part of the Diocese of Manchester. There are Roman Catholic churches in Oldham. These include Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St Patrick Church. It was built in 1870, was founded by priests from St Mary's Church in Oldham, and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the Interstate Highways, the {{corridor}} {{was to be}} upgraded to Interstate standards. In late 1958, a group of motel owners whose properties were located on SR84 strongly objected to any routing of I-8 that would not go through the city of Casa Grande. Motel owners in Yuma proposed their own alternative in 1961 to the four routings of I-8 through the city that had been proposed, raising concerns about losing revenue from tourism. In January 1962, the alternatives were narrowed down to two, {{with one of them}} being the route supported by the motel owners. However, nearby school officials expressed concerns regarding that route, because 1200students would {{no longer be able to}} walk to school if the freeway was constructed along that route. Later that year, a new route had been proposed, along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River. By 1963, work was in progress, with portions of the highway between Mohawk and Gila Bend, and between Gila Bend and near Stanfield upgraded. Other merchants objected to the routing, and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their concerns following the final approval of the route in 1964. A new park was to be built east of the Colorado River crossing, just opposite downtown; city officials hoped that this would give an improved look to the town as drivers first arrived.|$|E
