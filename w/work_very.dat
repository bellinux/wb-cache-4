5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not <b>work</b> <b>very</b> well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E

25|$|A {{popular belief}} exists that the Inuit have {{an unusually large}} number of words for snow. This is not accurate, and results from a {{misunderstanding}} {{of the nature of}} polysynthetic languages.

Parts of speech <b>work</b> <b>very</b> differently in the Inuit language than in English, so these definitions are somewhat misleading.|$|E
