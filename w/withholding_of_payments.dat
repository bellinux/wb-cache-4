[...] A clause which stipulates onerous provisions in a contract may be onerous, but unless it is triggered by breach {{it is not a}} penalty {{in the eyes of the}} law. Their Lordships also observed that a penalty clause may often be simple payment of money, but it could also encompass other things, such as the <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> requirements to transfer assets, or (on the facts before them) a requirement to repay a non-refundable deposit.|$|E

50|$|Theft of {{this sort}} should not be {{confused}} with reasonable rejection, where, for example, a customer does not pay because the services provided were not as advertised or because the services did not meet reasonable standards of quality. For example, if a roofer installs a new roof, but the roof leaks, the customer might be able to withhold payment until the leak has been fixed. <b>Withholding</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> without reason would be considered larceny.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{inception}} after {{the independence of}} Pakistan, the financial situation of APP continued to deteriorate until {{it was on the}} verge of collapse. This was a direct result <b>of</b> the <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> funds from the Government of Pakistan due towards APP from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in an effort to create a financial crisis for the national news agency. In the early 1960s, APP owed about Rs. 8 lakhs (Rupees 800,000) to the government's Post and Telegraph Department and another Rs. 12 lakhs (Rupees 1200,000) in unpaid subscription fees to foreign news agencies. The Government of Pakistan intervened and took over the agency on 15 July 1961 following the instructions of certain vested interests within the Government of Pakistan. A government ordinance was issued for it. The given reason was to strengthen APP's financial foundation.|$|R

50|$|According to the US State Department, {{expatriate}} {{workers from}} nations throughout Asia {{and parts of}} Africa are routinely subjected to forced labor and, in some instances, prostitution. Most of these people voluntarily migrate to Qatar as low-skilled laborers or domestic servants, but are subsequently subjected to conditions indicative of involuntary servitude. Some of the more common labor rights violations include beatings, <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> charging workers for benefits which are nominally {{the responsibility of the}} amir, severe restrictions on freedom of movement (such as the confiscation of passports, travel documents, or exit permits), arbitrary detention, threats of legal action, and sexual assault. Many migrant workers arriving for work in Qatar have paid exorbitant fees to recruiters in their home countries - a practice that makes workers highly vulnerable to forced labor once in Qatar.|$|R

50|$|The {{territorial}} government's {{ability to}} function was severely impacted by {{the two sets of}} territorial officials. As an early step in resolving the issue, a lawsuit was filed to declare the Republican nominee for Territorial Treasurer the legitimate office holder. The court ruled in favor of the Republican nominee, but the details of the ruling left other Republican nominees reluctant to also file suit. While the courts eventually ruled in favor of Wolfley's appointments, it was his administration's <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> salary <b>payments</b> that eventually forced all the Democratic nominees to surrender their offices.|$|R

40|$|Microcredit, a {{non-profit}} lending {{approach that is}} often championed {{as a source of}} women’s inclusion and empowerment, has in the past decade been followed by microfinance, a forprofit sibling of a different temperament. Microfinance in India is now in turmoil, precipitated by legislation in the state of Andhra Pradesh, which has encouraged <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> which in turn has frozen the market. This paper considers one precipitating condition of the crisis: the remarkable, new, and developing burden of formal economic debt that poor women in the state have only recently come to hold – debt that now surpasses one year’s family income, on average. The development of this lending sector follows upon innovation in lending to the poor of the global north over the past two decades, and the practices show noteworthy parallels. Both lending schemes have produced similar disproportionate burdens upon some low-status individuals within their respective economic orders, and both may exploit a vulnerability that is born of aspiration and produces great dysfunction for borrowers. This paper introduces the two lending schemes, sketches the parallels, and introduces the claim that ethical finance arrangements for the poor require attention to vulnerability, an under-utilized category in both liberal ethical theory and in finance...|$|R
60|$|More {{severe than}} any talk was Henry's {{instruction}} to Sully to <b>withhold</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> {{the last quarter}} of the prince's allowance, and to give refusals to his creditors and purveyors.

5000|$|It {{ceased to}} be remitted to the pope after 1320, but {{seemingly}} this was not permanent. The exact reason for the 'prohibition' by Edward III is unknown, but the threat <b>of</b> <b>withholding</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> Peter's Pence proved {{more than once a}} useful weapon against uncooperative popes in the hands of English kings. In 1366 and for some years after, it was refused {{on the grounds of the}} pope's obstinacy Evidently, however, the payment survived or was revived in some localities, because it was one <b>of</b> many <b>payments</b> abolished by Act of Parliament in the 25th year of Henry VIII's reign. The 1534 Act, [...] "An Act for the exoneration of exactions paid to the See of Rome", specifically mentions Peter's Pence. Along with other payments, it was [...] "never more to be levied … to any person", indicating that the payment was to be extinguished completely and not diverted to crown use. This occurred just prior to Henry's permanent break from the Church, which occurred in 1536, making England part of the Protestant Reformation.|$|R
40|$|Many {{economists have}} until fairly {{recently}} treated {{the family as}} a "black box" [...] analysing the behaviour of "the family" rather than of the individuals within the family. In this paper, we outline the new "collective" approach to modelling family behaviour which makes explicit the fact that families consist of individuals with different tastes and different experiences who may sometimes be in conflict with one another. This paper argues that {{new developments in the}} economics of the family are of interest to policy-makers because many policy conclusions are sensitive to the model of the family which is adopted. We illustrate the importance of the collective approach to decisions about child-support guidelines, automatic <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> support <b>payments,</b> child benefits, cash versus kind transfers, and individual versus family taxation. ...|$|R
40|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2008, as {{the world}} economy slowed and export-demand {{declined}} due to the global financial crisis, news reports began to appear detailing the return of rural migrants in China to their provincial homes. It was reported that 20 million rural migrant workers were laid off, and social instability rose due to both economic hardship and to the <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> wages. Over time, these circumstances have changed, due to both the Chinese government’s fiscal stimulus package and to those programmes that have been targeted specifically at assisting the country’s rural migrants. As a result, the situation for rural migrants is no longer dire; circumstances have been greatly ameliorated by proactive government policies. To confirm these results, {{in this paper we}} look both at the situation across China and briefly at a study carried out in Sichuan province...|$|R

40|$|Cash {{retention}} is {{a common}} means of protecting an employer from a contractor's insolvency as well as ensuring that contractors finish the work that they start. Similarly, contractors <b>withhold</b> part <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> due to their sub-contractors. Larger contracts tend {{to be subjected to}} smaller rates of retention. By calculating the cost of retention as an amount per year of a contract, it is shown that retention is far more expensive for firms whose work consists of short contracts. The extra cost is multiplied when the final payment is delayed, as it often is for those whose work takes place {{at the beginning of a}} project. This may explain why it is that main contractors are a lot less interested than sub-contractors in alternatives to cash retention, such as retention bond...|$|R

50|$|IRC §1441 et seq. {{regulates the}} <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> income taxes from <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> U.S. source income {{made to a}} non-U.S. person.

A §1441 Qualified Intermediary (QI) is {{generally}} a foreign bank or other foreign financial institution that signs {{an agreement with the}} Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

30|$|The child {{tax credits}} are not {{contingent}} on work. In principle, the working tax credits (WTCs) are withheld during weeks not at work (with {{an exception for}} a four-week spell in between jobs). As a result, if annual income qualifies a worker for a positive WTC, the WTC has both a positive and {{negative effect on the}} weekly employment tax wedge. The positive-tax effect comes from the effect of a week’s employment on annual income and therefore the weekly amount of WTC to be received during times of employment. The magnitude of the positive tax effect depends on the phase-out rate and the number of weeks during the year the person is at work (i.e., equation (4) itself would depend on n). The negative-tax effect comes from the <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> WTC <b>payments</b> during weeks not employed and, for the reasons noted below, is not relevant for my calculations.|$|R

40|$|The Institute's Discussion Paper {{series is}} {{designed}} to describe, and to elicit comments on, work in progress. Its papers should be considered working drafts. Child support reform has been proposed {{as a way of}} reducing "welfare dependency " and countering the "feminization of poverty " while increasing the well-being of children living in single-parent households. The federal government and some states have already begun to change laws regarding the establishment of child support awards and the collection <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> Routine income <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> child support <b>payments,</b> mandated by the 1988 Family Support Act, {{is designed to}} increase the proportion of child support collected. This paper assesses its effects on postdivorce income by using data from a demonstration <b>of</b> routine <b>withholding</b> in ten Wisconsin counties. Unfortunately, the data conclude that routine income withholding will have only a small effect on postdivorce income. The authors suggest that to substantially increase postdivorce income, as well as child support, awards in more family court cases must be established, the amount of those awards must be greater, and the collection rate for those who have awards must be improved.
