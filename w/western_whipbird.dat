25|$|The {{whipbirds}} and wedgebills are all {{found in}} Australia, occurring {{in a range}} of habitats from rainforest to arid scrub. The <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> is considered to be near-threatened because of habitat loss and fires while the Papuan whipbird is classed as data deficient.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo Island {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of the vulnerable fairy tern, the near threatened bush stone-curlew, hooded plover and <b>western</b> <b>whipbird,</b> and the biome-restricted rock parrot and purple-gaped honeyeater. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of Cape Barren geese, black-faced cormorants, Pacific gulls and pied oystercatchers, and sometimes of musk ducks, blue-billed ducks, freckled ducks, Australian shelducks, chestnut teals and banded stilts.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} rest of the South West, there is a fairly low {{diversity}} of bird species. Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions. Exceptions include the red-eared firetail (Stagonopleura oculata) and the white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana), both of which occur only in the karri forest; the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> (Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis) and western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), all of which inhabit the region's heath vegetation; and the noisy scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus), which inhabits densely vegetated gullies. Other forest birds include the purple-crowned lorikeet.|$|E

50|$|The {{area covered}} by the {{national}} park is also overlapped by the Coffin Bay Important Bird Area, a non-statutory classification determined by BirdLife International. This particular IBA supports over 1% of the world populations of pied and sooty oystercatchers, as well as significant numbers of fairy terns, hooded plovers, <b>western</b> <b>whipbirds,</b> rock parrots and blue-breasted fairy-wrens.|$|R
50|$|Three {{subspecies}} of the <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> include: Psophodes nigrogularis oberon {{found within}} the same areas as the western whipbird; Psophodes nigrogularis lashmari found on Kangaroo Island; and Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis found in the same areas as the main <b>western</b> <b>whipbird.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Phylogenetic {{research}} has found that the two whipbirds are not sister taxa. Toon, Joseph, and Burbidge’s (2013) study found that the eastern whipbird shares a more recent ancestor with wedgebills than the <b>western</b> <b>whipbird.</b> The inclusion of the Papuan whipbirds (Androphobus) in the genus may see the <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> become the sister species to that group. Schodde and Mason (1999) [...] recognised that there could be three lineages within Psophodes; the eastern whipbird, <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> and the wedgebills. This however, has not yet been confirmed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> (Psophodes nigrogularis) is a {{passerine}} bird {{found in}} several scattered populations across southern Australia. It is predominantly olive green in colour.|$|E
50|$|The eastern whipbird {{distribution}} {{is from the}} eastern side of Australia from north-eastern Queensland to eastern New South Wales and Victoria. The <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> is found in coastal areas from Perth to Hopetoun and in mallee heath between Wongan Hills and Hopetoun. The bird also covers areas within the south west of Australia and west of the sclerophyll forest. Records indicate the <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> is also found in Mt Gardner, Two People Bay, Mallee country, Banksia, stunted heath around Gnowangerup, and Borden.|$|E
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> {{is found}} in coastal {{thickets}} and dense forest understorey vegetation. Their preferred habitat consists of two-layered formation 2-3 metres high with understoreys which are dense to mid-dense. The <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> {{is known as the}} ‘rain bird’ as it is seeks the summit of coastal areas preceding rain. The bird is difficult to find as it is a ground runner and it rarely leaves low shrub areas. It is observed that the eastern whipbird prefers tall moist forests and riparian areas, even though the upper layer is rarely used.|$|E
50|$|Endangered {{species such}} as the noisy scrub-bird, western bristlebird and the <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> are known to inhabit the area. The {{endangered}} Western ringtail possum is also frequently sighted in the area.|$|E
50|$|Animals either recorded, or {{expected}} to be present, on the reserve include malleefowl, <b>western</b> <b>whipbird,</b> Carnaby’s cockatoo, western mouse, black-gloved wallaby and tammar wallaby.

50|$|Adults {{range in}} size from 19 cm to 23 cm in length. Adult males have grey heads with a raised black crest, a white {{forehead}} and throat, and a prominent black breast, {{while the rest of the}} body is grey or brown. Females and immature birds are less prominently coloured than the males, lacking the black breast and having a smaller, unraised black crest. Both males and females have orange-red eyes. Similar species include wedgebills and the <b>Western</b> <b>whipbird,</b> which female and juvenile bellbirds resemble.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{found within}} the {{national}} park as of 2003 included 111 species of native bird of which 13 species were scheduled in Australian and state legislation. The following 13 species were listed in the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 either as being vulnerable or rare species - chestnut quail-thrush, eastern reef egret, fairy tern, hooded plover, little tern, malleefowl, osprey, painted button-quail, peregrine falcon, rock parrot, shy heathwren, <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> and white-bellied sea-eagle while the malleefowl was also recognised nationally as a vulnerable species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} rest of the South West, there is a fairly low {{diversity}} of bird species. Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions.

Other forest birds include the purple-crowned lorikeet.|$|E
50|$|The park is {{also home}} to 22 species of mammal, 200 bird species, 41 species of reptile and 12 species of frog. It is {{recognised}} as an Important Bird Area; some of the rarer species are the western bristlebird, western ground parrot and the <b>western</b> <b>whipbird.</b> The endangered malleefowl is also known to inhabit the park with seven known and recorded sightings having been made 1998.Some of the mammals found are the very rare dibbler and the heath rat, both of which were thought to be extinct at one time or another. The tammar wallaby and woylie, both of which are threatened species, are known to inhabit the mallee and heath areas of the park. Other species such as the quenda, chuditch and the red-tailed phascogale also inhabit the area.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve forms {{part of the}} Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks Important Bird Area, {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because of its significance in the conservation of several rare and threatened bird species. [...] It supports a population of noisy scrub-birds, a species that {{was thought to be}} extinct until rediscovered in 1961. The population then was estimated at less than 100, while in 1994 it was thought to be around 1100 (of which 450 occur in the reserve). [...] Other threatened birds inhabiting the reserve are the western ground parrot, western bristlebird, <b>western</b> <b>whipbird</b> and Australasian bittern.Other threatened bird species that have been observed within the park include short-billed black cockatoo, peregrine falcon, hooded plover, little bittern and red-eared firetail.

5000|$|Warrenben Conservation Park is a {{protected}} area {{located in the}} Yorke Peninsula of South Australia about 12 km north-east of Marion Bay. The conservation park which held protected area status under previous legislation was re-proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 in 1972. The following statement of significance appears in the conservation park’s management plan:Together with nearby Innes National Park, it conserves a substantial proportion of the natural habitat remaining on southern Yorke Peninsula. The park comprises an area of undulating limestone plains and low, stabilised dunes that remain well vegetated with mallee and tea-tree scrub and some sheoak woodlands. It provides habitat {{for a number of}} threatened species including the nationally and state vulnerable Annual Candles, state rare Goldsack’s Leek-orchid (Prasophyllum goldsackii), and the nationally and state vulnerable Malleefowl and <b>Western</b> <b>Whipbird</b> (Psophodes nigrogularis leucogaster). [...] The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category I{{a protected}} area.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{and vocal}} {{diversity}} among {{closely related species}} reflects a combination of shared ancestry and recent species-specific adaptations. A small group of Australo-Papuan passerines in the core Corvoidea, the whipbirds and wedgebills (Psophodes, Androphobus), {{provide an opportunity to}} explore this. Vocally, the <b>Western</b> <b>Whipbird</b> (Psophodes nigrogularis sensu lato) is very similar to the two species of wedgebills, whereas the sibilant whipcrack-like song of male Eastern Whipbirds is distinctive among the group. Using phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA we show that Australian whipbirds are not sister taxa but that the Eastern Whipbird is sister to the wedgebills and that the <b>Western</b> <b>Whipbird</b> is sister to the other three members of the group. Wedgebills are nested within the whipbird clade, supporting their current inclusion in Psophodes. The topology and reconstruction of ancestral states suggests the similarity in vocalisation among wedgebills and the <b>Western</b> <b>Whipbird</b> is a result of shared ancestral character states, whereas the whipcrack-like song of the Eastern Whipbirds is autapomorphic.

40|$|The <b>Western</b> <b>Whipbird</b> (Psophodes nigrogularis) has {{a highly}} disjunct west-east {{distribution}} across southern Australia. Earlier morphological analyses recognised four subspecies in one species: P. n. nigrogularis and P. n. oberon in south-west Western Australia, and P. n. leucogaster of the Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas and the Murray Mallee, and P. n. lashmari, restricted to Kangaroo Island, both in eastern Australia. Later morphological analyses elevated P. n. nigrogularis to monotypic species rank, {{and placed the}} remaining western and two eastern taxa as three subspecies of a second species P. leucogaster. Initial mtDNA analysis questioned both arrangements but could not include all taxa. We used mtDNA sequence data from all available specimens of the entire group (DNA extracted from cryo-preserved tissues, toe-pads and feathers; holotypes excepted) to derive a more stable view of species limits. The samples fell into two strongly divergent but geographically structured groups, completely reflecting the eastern and western components of the distribution. Thus we see merit in treating the two geographical groupings as two species, P. nigrogularis {{in the west and}} P. leucogaster in the east, each having two subspecies. Nuclear data could test whether the two western subspecies in particular are genetically isolated or currently exchanging genes...|$|E
