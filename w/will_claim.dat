5|$|After Prince died in 1899 he was {{replaced}} by the Reverend John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. Around 1890, Smyth-Pigott again started leading meetings of the community and recruited 50 young female followers to supplement the ageing population of Agapemonites. He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> that he was a god another time, which did come true as in the life time of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god. After the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he claimed again being god and was sentenced to death and died.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel is {{sent by the}} Brotherhood of Light to the Lake of Oblivion, {{where his}} {{deceased}} wife, Marie, tells him that Spirits who founded the Brotherhood said that the Lords of Shadow's power will save the world. Gabriel meets {{a man from the}} Brotherhood called Zobek, who states that a prophecy has been kept a secret by a select few, which tells of a pure-hearted warrior who <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> the Lords of Shadow's power to overcome evil. Zobek says that he and Gabriel must enter the lands of the Dark Lords in order to unite the Heavens with the world again, and that with this Gabriel can bring Marie back from the dead. Gabriel defeats the werewolf Cornell (Richard Ridings) and the vampire Carmilla (Sally Knyvette) for the first two pieces of the God Mask on his journey, while learning that they were once two of the three founding members of the Order who fought the spawns of Satan in God's favor until they transformed into the Spirits, with power only second to God's. After they ascended to the Heavens, they left behind their dark sides, who were known as the Lords of Shadow.|$|E

The psychology backed methodologies applied in qualitative marketing research are continuously changing and being further developed. One of the examples of psychology theory developed specifically for use in marketing research is morphological psychology.|$|E
25|$|However, chance plays a {{large role}} in Button Men; it is always {{possible}} for a 20-sided die to roll a 1 at an inopportune time. Among tournament legal buttons, at least, no match-up is impossible for either side to win. Inevitably it happens that a weaker Button Man or a less skilled player <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> some improbable victories due to lucky die rolls. This effect is offset somewhat, however, by the rule that a player must win three rounds to win a game.|$|E
25|$|The narrator adopts the attire of his {{hosts and}} begins also to adopt their customs. Zee {{falls in love}} with him and tells her father, who orders Taee to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taee and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of {{habitable}} space underground and <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.|$|E

25|$|Immediately, Horace states he is {{changing}} his will to leave Alexandra {{everything except the}} railroad bonds which, he <b>will</b> <b>claim,</b> he freely lent to Leo. This story will thwart any attempt by Regina to blackmail her brothers over their theft and will deny her any claim to an ownership stake in the mill. Alexandra is rescued from a larger misfortune, that of marrying the repugnant Leo, by Birdie, the only person able to do so, who wills herself the courage to tell the younger woman not to marry the wrong man (i.e. Leo), lest she bear the consequences {{for the rest of}} her life. Unfortunately, Oscar overhears part of the conversation and, after Alexandra is out of earshot, slaps Birdie hard.|$|E
500|$|..... (A)fter this case, every {{defendant}} <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> {{that something}} the Government agent did before soliciting the crime [...] "created" [...] a predisposition {{that was not}} there before. For example, a bribetaker <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> that {{the description of the}} amount of money available was so enticing that it implanted a disposition to accept the bribe later offered. A drug buyer <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> that the description of the drug's purity and effects was so tempting that it created the urge to try it for the first time. In short, the Court's opinion could be read to prohibit the Government from advertising the seductions of criminal activity as part of its sting operation, for fear of creating a predisposition in its suspects.|$|E

Pansomun, as Christian convert Fernando Malang Balagtas signed in 1589 a will on the Kapampangan territory. Pansomun/Balagtas stated that {{he was born in}} Tabungao (Sta.

500|$|DiStasio quickly hires lawyer Marvin Exley (Ron Rifkin) {{and claims}} {{diplomatic}} immunity. After Deng positively identifies DiStasio from the lineup, Tutuola and Benson {{take him to}} Dr. Warner's (Tamara Tunie) office for a forensic exam. The results confirm that his DNA matches that recovered from the crime scene. Benson and Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) then warn Deng that DiStasio's defense team <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> in court that she fabricated the accusation for monetary reasons and {{ask her if she}} has been completely truthful; she replies that she has been. Later, the police and prosecution learn of a tape recording of Deng in which she admits that she could get a lot of money from DiStasio for assaulting her, weakening her credibility. However, Deng does not retract her accusation and insists that she was raped by DiStasio.|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Hills' {{concept of}} the [...] "cult blockbuster" [...] {{involves}} cult followings inside larger, mainstream films. [...] Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings. [...] The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and fan works. [...] Hills identifies three different cult followings for The Lord of the Rings, each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream. [...] Academic Emma Pett identifies Back to the Future (1985) as {{another example of a}} cult blockbuster. [...] Although the film topped the charts when it was released, it has developed a nostalgic cult following over the years. [...] The hammy acting by Christopher Lloyd and quotable dialogue draw a cult following, as they mimic traditional cult films. [...] Blockbuster science fiction films that include philosophical subtexts, such as The Matrix, allow cult film fans to enjoy them on a higher level than the mainstream. Star Wars, with its large cult following in geek subculture, has been cited as both a cult blockbuster and a cult film. [...] Although a mainstream epic, Star Wars has provided its fans with a spirituality and culture outside of the mainstream. [...] Fans, in response to the popularity of these blockbusters, <b>will</b> <b>claim</b> elements for themselves while rejecting others. [...] For example, in the Star Wars film series, mainstream criticism of Jar Jar Binks focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing. [...] Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings. [...] They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media, as cult blockbusters are often franchised, preconceived as a film series, or both. [...] To reduce mainstream accessibility, a film series can be self-reflexive and full of in-jokes that only longtime fans can understand.|$|E
