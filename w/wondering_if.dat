5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' {{drumming}} style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E

Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E

5|$|The episode borrows {{heavily from}} the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and is largely {{based upon the}} 1939 Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None. The opening scene of the episode {{is similar to that}} of Stanley Kubrik's The Shining. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois remarks on the estate's beauty, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> {{television}} host Jeff Probst has a similar home. As they walk into the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} also subject to criticism, however. Next Generation {{objected to the}} {{difficulty}} level, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> the challenge was added to prolong the gameplay. The Electric Playground pointed to the unusual control scheme and lack of configuration options. GameSpy cited the camera's behavior, the learning curve for the controls, and graphical shortcomings such as flickering and jagginess. GameSpot criticized the game's conclusion for its dramatic change in gameplay to a rail shooter-like style at the story's climax, {{as well as a}} leveling-off of the difficulty. Lastly, Gamecritics felt that the story was overly short and the characters were underdeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional {{for the first time}} in years, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> God is speaking, but that no one is listening.|$|E

5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Gator Bowl, Vick was asked by an NBC broadcaster if he intended to return to Virginia Tech for another year of collegiate football. He responded that he would discuss matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision. That announcement sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> Vick would choose to return to school or enter the 2001 NFL Draft. Virginia Tech, through its football coaching staff, began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay. On January 11, 2001, Vick held a press conference to announce that he would be forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft. Immediately after the announcement, he was predicted to be the No. 1 pick in the draft, a hypothesis realized on April 21, when he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons, who had traded draft picks in order {{to have the right to}} select Vick.|$|E
5|$|Nuka-Worlds {{release date}} of August 30, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was {{announced}} in a post on the Bethesda Game Studios blog on August 15,. along with the expansion's trailer. Bethesda started releasing keys for the beta version on August 16 and pre-release gameplay was live streamed through Twitch.tv on August 23, with the official trailer coming out two days later. The expansion has a larger file size than Far Harbor, being 3.66 GB as opposed to 2.69 GB. This resulted in people <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> Nuka-World would contain more gameplay, although the price implied it would be somewhere between Automatron and Far Harbor. The North American release of Nuka-World on PlayStation 4 was delayed due to unknown problems. Unlike the PS4 launch of Far Harbor, no major stability or frame-rate issues were found while playing, except when inside a location called The Galactic Zone. In the article on the website Push Square, {{it was noted that}} the cause of the frame-rate issues in The Galactic Zone were unknown and were not consistent.|$|E

25|$|Attendance did {{not improve}} as the season progressed, in fact, it got much worse, {{averaging}} an announced 5,703.

25|$|Is {{he going}} to throw it away? Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different.

25|$|The Young Marrieds was ABC's {{first attempt}} at a sister serial for General Hospital. It ran for only two years, racking up a total of 380 episodes. Despite its {{moderate}} popularity, it was aired against CBS's top-rated The Edge of Night, which it could not compete against. The series finale aired on March 25, 1966, with the show's main protagonist contemplating suicide. It ended in a cliffhanger, leaving the audience <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> the man had killed himself or not. The Young Marrieds was set in the fictional suburb of Queen's Point, which was considered by the writers to be a suburb of Port Charles.|$|E
25|$|Other {{alternatives}} {{were also}} sought: Roosevelt inquired about {{the rate at}} which the Supreme Court denied certiorari, hoping to attack the Court for the small number of cases it heard annually. He also asked about the case of Ex parte McCardle, which limited the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> Congress could strip the Court's power to adjudicate constitutional questions. The span of possible options even included constitutional amendments; however, Roosevelt soured to this idea, citing the requirement of three-fourths of state legislatures needed to ratify, and that an opposition wealthy enough could too easily defeat an amendment. Further, Roosevelt deemed the amendment process in itself too slow when time was a scarce commodity.|$|E
