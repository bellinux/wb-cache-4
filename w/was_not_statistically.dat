5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} match of the tour, Hirst scored 92 {{and used his}} pull shot more {{effectively}} than on other occasions. He followed this with 66 in the third match but did not take many wickets before the first Test. Warner considered he had nevertheless bowled well but was finding it difficult to maintain his energy in the hot conditions; his bowling lost pace and sting later in his bowling spells. Hirst played in all five Test matches, the first two of which were won by England. In the first game, Hirst took two wickets. In his first innings, he scored a duck and was dropped by Frank Laver before he had scored in the second. He survived to score 60 not out and his partnership with Tom Hayward guided England to victory after wickets had fallen early chasing a target of 194. Hirst scored 11 runs in the second match and took three wickets on a difficult batting pitch, badly affected by rain. Although this performance <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> impressive, Warner thought he bowled very well. During the third Test, Hirst took three wickets and, with innings of 58 and 44, {{was one of the}} few successful England batsmen in a poor performance which enabled Australia to win the match. England won the crucial fourth match to ensure the series victory. Hirst took two wickets and contributed scores of 25 and 18. Australia achieved a win in the final match in which Hirst scored 0 and 1, but after taking no wickets in the first innings he achieved his best Test figures of the tour in the second, with five for 48.|$|E

For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005).

A two-week study had participants supplement their diet with sugar-sweetened soft drinks, artificially sweetened soft drinks, or neither.

25|$|Cabozantinib, {{trade name}} Cometriq, was granted {{marketing}} approval (November 2012) by the U.S. FDA for this indication. Cabozantinib {{which is a}} potent inhibitor of RET, MET and VEGF was evaluated in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. It was shown to improve overall survival by 5 months for the treated cohort vs. placebo, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> significant. However, cabozantinib was particularly effective in patients with the RET M918T mutation, extending overall survival by roughly 2 years, doubling survival vs. untreated patient (4 years vs. 2 year). Treatment with cabozantinib did require many dose reduction to mitigate side effects. It {{has been suggested that}} the trial dose of 140mg was excessive, particularly in lower body mass patients. Ongoing trials have been scheduled to identify more optimal dosing regimes. Activity has been observed, in practice at doeses of 1.2mg/kg.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{played for}} Sussex {{throughout}} the 1921 season {{and according to}} Wisden [...] "made a distinct advance". His batting record {{was similar to the}} previous season, although he increased his number of wickets in the season to 90 at an average of 30.64. Wisden notes that his bowling <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> good, but that his biggest impact came in fielding, which was [...] "brilliant in the extreme. He was described on all hands as the best mid-off in England." [...] In 1922, Gilligan assumed the Sussex captaincy from Herbert Wilson. The team's results were not impressive, but Wisden said that the team were attractive to watch and excelled in fielding, in which Gilligan led by example. Gilligan later recalled that he received great support from George Cox, the senior professional in the team. Personally, Gilligan had his best season to date with bat and ball; he scored 916 runs and took 135 wickets at an average of 18.75. Based on his good form, he was selected in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Appearing for the Gentlemen, a team of amateurs, his fielding in particular impressed commentators. He was selected in a further representative match, when he played for the [...] "Rest of England" [...] against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In the latter game, he took eight wickets in total. At the end of the season, Gilligan was included in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team to tour South Africa and play a Test series.|$|E
