5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal. Solid <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> disposed of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{management}} and recycling are co-ordinated by Poole Borough Council {{in partnership with}} Viridor. Locally produced inert <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> sent to landfill for disposal. Recycle <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> taken to Viridor's Materials Recycling Facility in Crayford for processing. Poole's distribution network operator for electricity is Scottish and Southern Energy. Drinking and waste water is managed by Wessex Water; groundwater sources in Wiltshire and Dorset provide 75% of drinking water, the rest comes from reservoirs fed by rivers and streams.|$|E

40|$|Low level {{radioactive}} <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> {{produced during}} {{the operation of}} the radioactive and nuclear installations of the Nuclear Engineering Institute (Instituto de Engenharia Nuclear, IEN) situated in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. These <b>wastes</b> can <b>be</b> generated during the operation and maintenance of the CV- 28 Cyclotron, the radioisotopes production, the research activities using natural thorium and uranium in chemical laboratories and, eventually, during the operation Argonauta Reactor. In accordance to the methodology of the radwastes management adopted in the IEN, the <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> segregated and treated depending on theirs physical, chemical, biological and radiological properties. The wastes with important levels of activity are separate and collected in special containers. Wastes containing short-lived radionuclides are also separated and left away for decaying. Solid <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> constituted of materials used in laboratories, such as papers, rubber gloves, plastics, over shoes, broken glassware, metal pieces, etc. These <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> classified as compressible, combustible, non-compressible and non-combustible. The solid <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> collected in suitable containers placed throughout the working area. Basically, the treatment methods used for these <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> activity decay, decontamination and compaction...|$|R
50|$|Hazardous <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> <b>wastes</b> with {{properties}} {{that make them}} dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous <b>wastes</b> can <b>be</b> liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludges. They can be by-products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms, RCRA hazardous <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> <b>wastes</b> that appear {{on one of the}} four hazardous wastes lists (F-list, K-list, P-list, or U-list), or exhibit at least one of four characteristics-ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. Hazardous <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C.|$|R
5|$|Food <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} {{attempts to}} minimize its environmental impact through several mechanisms, including minimizing area usage. Energy consumption {{is reduced by}} using recirculating excess heat to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating. <b>Waste</b> <b>is</b> minimized through purchase planning and recycling; the remaining <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> compressed and transported away from the Antarctic. Fuel is handled {{in such a way}} that even small spills are minimized. In 2016 a solar PV plant with 7.3 kilowatt peak has been installed on one of the roof tops. It serves as a pilot installation for the declared middle term target of reducing the oil consumption of the research station significantly, by extending the solar PV plant over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{reactors}} were decommissioned {{at the end}} of the Cold War, and the Hanford site is the focus of one of the world's largest environmental cleanup, managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the Washington Department of Ecology and the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270billionUSgallons (1billionm3) of groundwater contaminated by high-level nuclear waste that has leaked out of Hanford's underground storage tanks. , 1millionUSgallons (3,785m3) of highly radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> traveling through groundwater toward the Columbia River. This <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> expected to reach the river in 12 to 50years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule.|$|E

40|$|Marble <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} {{in two different}} forms in size. One type of marble <b>wastes</b> <b>is</b> in lump size and easily be evaluated in civil industry and other construction works. The other type of the wastes in fine particle size and may be even deteriorate environment, in particular, agricultural fields near cities. Both types of marble <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> mainly the by-products of marble procvessingplants in the country. Beneficiation from these <b>wastes</b> <b>is</b> significantly important for the economy of country. Fine marble <b>wastes</b> may <b>be</b> considered as lime raw materials without calcining by the local lime consumers and {{may be used as}} lime in various industrial sectors such as rubber, paper, animal food productions. Another use of marble <b>wastes</b> can <b>be</b> air pollution control and holding up toxic gases in chemical plants...|$|R
50|$|The most {{overlooked}} toxic {{and hazardous}} <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> the household products in everyday homes that are improperly disposed of such as old batteries, pesticides, paint, and car oil. Toxic <b>waste</b> can <b>be</b> reactive, ignitable, and corrosive. In the United States, these <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).|$|R
5|$|Waste {{management}} is {{handled by the}} local authority, Fife Council. Kerbside recycling operates in the town. A three-bin collection is {{in place for the}} majority of residents. Kirkcaldy has one recycling centre and several recycling points, all operated by Fife Council. Non-hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> sent to landfill at Lochhead near Dunfermline, and Lower Melville Wood, near Ladybank.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} proportion of food <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> produced by the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste. Potatoes, bread slices and apples are respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion. A majority of wasted food is avoidable, with the rest being divided almost equally by foods which are unavoidable (e.g. tea bags) and unavoidable due to preference (e.g. bread crusts) or cooking type (e.g. potato skins).|$|E
5|$|Great Britain has 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes {{much of its}} {{spent fuel}} at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield {{has a history of}} environmental and safety problems, including a fire in a nuclear plant in Windscale, and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant (THORP).|$|E
50|$|The {{island was}} the subject of a scandal in which 600,000 tons of toxic <b>waste</b> <b>were</b> {{illegally}} dumped on the island. In 2000, after a 25-year legal battle, the <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> transported to Naoshima for processing.|$|R

50|$|In Scotland in 1993, 14 {{million tons}} of <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> produced. 100,000 tons <b>was</b> toxic <b>waste</b> and 260,000 tons <b>was</b> {{controlled}} <b>waste</b> {{from other parts of}} Britain and abroad. 45% of the special <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> in liquid form and 18% was asbestos - radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> not included. Of the controlled waste, 48% came from the demolition of buildings, 22% from industry, 17% from households and 13% from business - only 3% were recycled. Ninety percent of controlled <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> buried in landfill sites and produced 2 {{million tons of}} methane gas. 1.5% was burned in incinerators and 1.5% were exported to be disposed of or recycled. There are 900 disposal sites in Scotland.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E
5000|$|Discarded Wastes: P-List and U-List <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> {{actually}} sublists of {{the same}} major list applying to discarded wastes. These wastes apply to commercial chemical products that are considered hazardous when discarded and are regulated under the following U.S. Federal Regulation: 40 C.F.R. 261.33 (e) and (f). P-List <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> <b>wastes</b> that <b>are</b> considered [...] "acutely hazardous" [...] when discarded and are subject to more stringent regulation. Nitric oxide {{is an example of}} a P-list waste and carries the number P076. U-Listed <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> considered [...] "hazardous" [...] when discarded and are regulated in a somewhat less stringent manner than P-Listed <b>wastes.</b> Acetone <b>is</b> an example of a U-Listed waste and carries the number U002.|$|R
5000|$|Special Waste: Six {{categories}} of <b>waste</b> <b>were</b> given deferral from hazardous waste requirements by EPA under proposed {{hazardous waste management}} regulations. This special category of <b>wastes</b> <b>was</b> maintained until further human health and environmental risk assessments could be completed. As per this deferral, the six {{categories of}} special <b>waste</b> <b>are</b> 1) Cement kiln dust, 2) Mining waste, 3) oil and gas drilling muds and oil production brines, 4) beneficiation and processing waste from phosphate rock mining, 5) uranium waste, and 6) utility or fossil fuel combustion waste. The difference between special wastes and other <b>wastes</b> <b>is</b> the large volume of generation of special waste at a time leading to less human and environmental risk.|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{inadequate}} {{management of}} hospital waste, that have toxic, infectious and chemical <b>wastes,</b> <b>is</b> {{a risk factor}} for humans and environment. Aim To identify, quantify and assess the risk associated to the management of hospital residues. Material and methods: A cross sectional assessment of the generation of hazardous waste from a hospital, between June and August 2005, was performed. The environmental risk associated to the management of non-radioactive hospital <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> assessed and the main problems related to solid <b>waste</b> <b>were</b> identified. Results: The rate of generation of hazardous non-radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> 1. 35 tons per months or 0. 7 kg/bed/day. Twenty five percent of hazardous liquid <b>waste</b> <b>were</b> drained directly to the sewage system. The drug preparation unit of the pharmacy had the higher environmental risk associated to the generation of hazardous waste. The internal transport of hazardous waste had a high risk {{due to the lack of}} trip planning. The lack of training of personnel dealing with these <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> another risk factor. Conclusions: Considering that an adequate management of hospital waste should minimize risks for patients, the hospital that was evaluated lacks an integral management system for its wast...|$|R
5|$|The city generates 5,34,760kg of {{domestic}} solid wastes everyday, while per capita generation of <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> 0.40kg per day. The sewer service areas {{are divided into}} nine zones in the city. Allahabad Municipal Corporation oversees the solid waste management project. Allahabad was the first city to get pre-paid meters for electricity bill in Uttar Pradesh.

5|$|The large {{population}} in Antananarivo {{and the high}} density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> inadequate. Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhausts, residential coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city. Antananarivo {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element fire is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some fat {{from all around the}} body is made into semen.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, a {{construction}} <b>waste</b> site <b>was</b> established {{east of the}} settlement on a 36-hectare site. In 1998, the dumping of building <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> ended, but in 1999 more construction <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> used to profile and recultivate the landfill site. As part of that, it was planned to create a hill with two observation plateaux, optically separated by a saddle.|$|R

5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> not as much of a problem for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor currently resides.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> excreted as uric acid.|$|E
