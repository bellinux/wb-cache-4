25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> into this year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the words}} of former NASA Administrator, Michael D. Griffin, [...] "The goal isn't just {{scientific}} exploration.... It's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the Solar System as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> in time.... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive.... If we humans want to survive {{for hundreds of thousands}} or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets ... colonize the Solar System and one day go beyond." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, {{who said}} that she had spoken a number of times with Karzai in recent days, {{announced}} that Karzai would be making an announcement the next day, saying [...] "He is going to announce his intentions ... But I don't want to pre-empt in any way President Karzai's statement, which will set the stage for how <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> in the next stage of this." [...] An unnamed diplomatic source also said that Karzai would be making a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide, and claimed that Karzai was prepared to make concessions, such as forming a power-sharing coalition or agreeing to a run-off.|$|E

2500|$|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, {{stating that}} she had spoken with Karzai {{a number of times}} in recent days, {{announced}} that Karzai would be making an announcement the next day, saying [...] "He is going to announce his intentions ... I am very hopeful that we will see a resolution in line with the constitutional order in the next several days. But I don't want to pre-empt in any way President Karzai's statement, which will set the stage for how <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> in the next stage of this." [...] A diplomatic source told The Times that Karzai would make a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N.

2500|$|Clinton {{spent her}} initial days as Secretary of State telephoning dozens of world leaders. She said {{the world was}} eager {{to see a new}} American foreign policy and that, [...] "There is a great {{exhalation}} of breath going on around the world. We've got a lot of damage to repair." [...] She did indicate that not every past policy would be repudiated, and specifically said it was essential that the six-party talks over the North Korean nuclear weapons program continue. Clinton re-emphasized her views during her first speech to State Department employees when she said, [...] "There are three legs to the stool of American foreign policy: defense, diplomacy, and development. And we are responsible for two of the three legs. And we will make clear, as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> that diplomacy and development are essential tools in achieving the long-term objectives of the United States. And I will do all that I can, working with you, to make it abundantly clear that robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America's future." [...] Clinton also soon visited the United States Agency for International Development, where she met employees and said they would be getting extra funds and attention during the new administration.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] {{answered}} James Morris. [...] "The question is, shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and investigate, {{or return}} to the post and give the alarm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{interrupted}} {{the flight of}} Leslie's voice, and as the singing came nearer, the hum of low words ceased. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> to meet George. Leslie sat up, clasping his knees, and did not speak. George came near, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this was}} disheartening {{to those of}} us who, twenty years before, had visioned Chicago as a shining center of American art, but <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> with our preparations, hoping that a fairly {{representative}} delegation could be induced to come.|$|R
6000|$|As me and {{my companions}} were {{scrambling}} up a hill, The path was lost in rolling stones, but <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> still; For <b>we</b> can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere, And it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to spare! ...|$|R

6000|$|So we stroll {{and look}} at the shops, at the {{filigree}} gold jewelling of the peasants, at a good bookshop. But there is little to see and therefore the question is, shall we go on? Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You read my {{thoughts}} well," [...] Major Kosuth declared. [...] "I {{do not seek}} to excuse them. For half a life-time we Turks have toiled and striven, always in danger of our lives, to help forward those things which have now come to pass. I think that our lives have become tinged with somberness and apprehension. Now that {{the first step is}} achieved, <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> still with trepidation. We need friends, Baron de Grost." ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. Oh, well, <b>we</b> must <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> there. I {{thought you}} told me {{yesterday}} the firm's balance was over four hundred.|$|R
60|$|THESE events {{occupied}} so much time, that June had numbered {{more than}} half its days, before we again commenced our long-protracted journey. The day after my return to Versailles, six men, from among those I had left at Villeneuve-la-Guiard, arrived, with intelligence, {{that the rest of the}} troop had already proceeded towards Switzerland. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> in the same track.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, true," [...] said Stanley; [...] "and it's a great {{matter to}} get fairly started. Once off <b>we</b> must <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> All ready, lads?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} it is not allowed on duty, and it is not allowed for midshipmen at all; but of an evening, if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> the {{officers}} on watch never take any notice. And now about to-morrow, Dinah. Of course I am most anxious to know what the news is, and whether this rising has extended over the whole of the island, and {{if it is true that}} everywhere they have murdered the whites." ...|$|E
6000|$|So wise we are! {{yet what}} fantastic fooleries still stream forth from my contemporary's brains; {{how are we}} still haunted! The speech of Faust {{concerning}} him is mis-translated by Shelley, who understood the humour of the piece, {{as well as the}} poetry, but not the particular humours of it. Nothing can be more expressive of a conceited, narrow-minded reviewer. 'Oh he!--he is absolutely everywhere,--What others dance, he must decide upon. If he can't chatter about every step, 'tis as good as not made at all. Nothing provokes him so much as when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> If you'd turn round and round in a circle, as he does in his old mill, he'd approve of that perhaps; especially if you'd consult him about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have marked}} it all morning, Nigel. This {{horseman}} has kept ever upon our flank, spying upon us or waiting {{to make some}} attempt upon us. Now I should be right glad to have a prisoner, for it is my wish to know something of this country-side, and these peasants can speak neither French nor English. I would have you linger here in hiding when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> This man will still follow us. When he does so, yonder wood will lie betwixt you and him. Do you ride round it and come upon him from behind. There is broad plain upon his left, and we will cut him off upon the right. If your horse be indeed the swifter, then you cannot fail to take him." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the horses}} were swollen out to about twice their natural {{dimensions}} (there {{seems to be an}} idea here, that this kind of inflation improves their going), <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> again, through mud and mire, and damp, and festering heat, and brake and bush, attended always by the music of the frogs and pigs, until nearly noon, when we halted at a place called Belleville.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>we</b> to <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> sir, as {{men should}} who {{set out to}} relieve a besieged fort, or must we loiter here until the enemy has worked his will?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Morales nodded. “It is a {{month since}} we marched east {{with a strong}} company and a little machine‐gun,” he said. “We march by night, and it is sunrise when we climb the Alturas gorge. Above, three leagues away, hides a company of the Sin Verguenza, and the Captain Vincente who marches round will take them in the rear. I have scouts thrown forward, and we march silently, but by and by the front files come running back and there is firing in the pass. The Sin Verguenza, it seems, are upon us, {{but that is not}} wise of them. Figure you the place—the rock one cannot climb above us, a barranco, very deep, below, and the machine‐gun to sweep the track. Pouf! It is swept. The Sin Verguenza melt away, and <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> to {{conclude}} the affair.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{described}} {{fully the}} market at Attegrat in a former letter; and as this was precisely the same scene upon a rather larger scale, I have little to add to what I then said. Very large quantities of flour were brought in, and the commissariat secured a considerable supply. Numbers of mules, donkeys, and cattle were also there. The small-goods market too was crowded, and herbs and grain of all sorts—onions, chillies, cloth, {{and most of the}} other articles I mentioned as having seen at Attegrat—were here, with the exception only of pumpkins, of which I did not see a single specimen. I, however, bought three pounds of coffee, which I look upon as a great prize, as it will be a change from the excessively bitter herb termed by courtesy tea. The commissariat have purchased a considerable quantity of coffee, and I am told we shall find it much more plentiful as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> This will be a very great boon for the men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us talk plainly {{for a few}} moments, Grace, and {{understand}} each other before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> or backward. It is five days since we left the hut; were we even certain of finding our wandering way back again, {{we could not reach}} them before another five days had elapsed; by that time all will be over. They have either been saved or are beyond the reach of help. This sounds harsh, Grace, but it is no harsher than the fact. Had we stayed, we would, without helping them, have only shared their fate. I might have been in your brother's place, you in your sister's. It is our fortune, not our fault, that we are not dying with them. It has been willed that you and I should be saved. It might have been willed that we should have perished in our attempts to succour them, and that relief which came to them would have never reached us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{scarcely}} {{expected to}} find him there, but the villagers held back, while <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> with cocked rifles. We found, however, nothing but a few bones and a quantity of blood. The tiger had made off at the approach of daylight into the jungle, which was about two miles distant. We traced him easily enough, and found that he had entered a large ravine, from which several smaller ones branched off.|$|R
60|$|I {{think it}} is not untrue {{to say that in}} these years we are passing through a decisive period {{in the history of our}} country. The {{wonderful}} century which followed the Battle of Waterloo and the downfall of the Napoleonic domination, which secured to this small island so long and so resplendent a reign, has come to an end. We have arrived at a new time. Let us realise it. And with that new time strange methods, huge forces, larger combinations--a Titanic world--have sprung up around us. The foundations of our power are changing. To stand still would be to fall; to fall would be to perish. <b>We</b> must <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> <b>We</b> will <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> <b>We</b> will <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> into a way of life more earnestly viewed, more scientifically organised, more consciously national than any we have known. Thus alone shall we be able to sustain and to renew through the generations which are to come, the fame and the power of the British race.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> and {{examined}} the place and saw the long tracks which her feet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge. If she had finished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in {{the edge of the}} water, and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among the half-covered boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two minutes. We had come exceedingly near witnessing her death.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Very good,’ was his reply; and he {{immediately}} hoisted the heavier of my trunks upon his shoulder, and taking one {{handle of the}} second, signed to me to help him at the other end. In this order we made good our retreat from the house, and without the least adventure, drew pretty near {{to the corner of}} Euston Road. Before a house, where there was a light still burning, my companion paused. ‘Let us here,’ said he, ‘set down our boxes, while <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> {{to the end of the}} street in quest of a cab. By doing so, we can still keep an eye upon their safety, and we avoid the very extraordinary figure we should otherwise present—a young man, a young lady, and a mass of baggage, standing castaway at midnight on the streets of London.’ So it was done, and the event proved him to be wise; for long before there was any word of a cab, a policeman appeared upon the scene, turned upon us the full glare of his lantern, and hung suspiciously behind us in a doorway.|$|E

60|$|Still, {{it was a}} fine day, and the {{temperature}} was delicious, and though we had left Summer behind us in the west, and were fast leaving Spring, we were moving towards Niagara and home.
