5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain <b>why</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was <b>why,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E

25|$|Because icons in Orthodoxy {{must follow}} {{traditional}} standards and are essentially copies, Orthodoxy never developed {{the reputation of}} the individual artist as Western Christianity did, and the names of even the finest icon painters are seldom recognized except by some Eastern Orthodox or art historians. Icon painting was and is a conservative art, in many cases considered a craft, in which the painter is essentially merely a tool for replication. The painter did not seek individual glory but considered himself a humble servant of God. That is <b>why</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th and early 20th centuries, icon painting in Russia went into a great decline with the arrival of machine lithography on paper and tin, which could produce icons in great quantity and much more cheaply than the workshops of painters. Even today large numbers of paper icons are purchased by Orthodox rather than more expensive painted panels.|$|E

25|$|A second Parliament {{was called}} later the same year, and {{became known as}} the Long Parliament. Cromwell was again {{returned}} as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628–29, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain <b>why</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first week of the Parliament {{he was in charge of}} presenting a petition for the release of John Lilburne, who had become a Puritan cause célèbre after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the House of Lords and Members of the House of Commons with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of Essex, Warwick and Bedford, Oliver St John and Viscount Saye and Sele. At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the Root and Branch Bill for the abolition of episcopacy.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values. According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), one of the reasons <b>why</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E

At the Quahog Day Spa, Peter mentions that he needs the sauna's treatment after a stressful morning; the scene cuts to a non-sequitur that parodies the opening scene of Back to the Future. Another scene in the spa references the film Ghost; representations of the film's stars, Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore, are on top of Peter's back giving him a massage. After Lois chastises Peter, he recites the speech John Candy made in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles nearly verbatim.

500|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} {{one of the}} grandest rooms in the house, the Library. The room was {{formerly known as the}} Great Chamber; in a 16th-century mansion, such as Montacute, this room was the epicentre of all ceremony and state: hence, its position {{at the head of the}} principal staircase, making it the finale of a processional route. Here, the most important guests would have been received, and where the Phelips dined formally with their guests and where musical entertainments and dancing would take place. The Great Chamber at Montacute contains the finest chimney-piece in the house; however, its classical statuary depicting nudes are long gone, victims of Victorian prudery. During the 18th century the room was shut up and used a store and permitted to decay; this explains <b>why</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century it was completely restored in [...] "Elizabethan style." [...] The strapwork ceiling, panelling and bookcases all date from this period.

Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush gave the song four stars out of five, explaining that it [...] "possesses a hook that will send people running for the dance floor", although [...] "Gomez's vocal is pretty flat [...] but then again, this isn't the kind of song to show off any sort of vocal gymnastics." ...|$|E
500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity.

No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned, <b>why,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?"
