Like W1 and W3, horses <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of dominant white may be pure white or near-white, with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time. This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a missense mutation on Exon12.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} the Eastern Front, Müncheberg {{travelled}} to Berlin {{where he}} briefly served {{on the staff of the}} General der Jagdflieger Galland discussing air combat tactics and how to lead a fighter wing.

His first major task was re-equipping JG51 with the Fw190. Under his leadership JG51 became the first fighter wing on the Eastern Front to equip <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type.</b> He claimed his first victories in the east on 3 August 1942, shooting down two Petlyakov Pe-2 dive bomber near Rzhev.|$|E
