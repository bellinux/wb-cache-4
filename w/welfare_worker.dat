40|$|Abstract Social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> {{employed}} in the same county base their assessments on the same laws, routines and guidelines, yet it seems that they sometimes come to different decisions. It's the discretion that enables the social workers to make individualized decisions adapted to each clients unique situation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> reflections on discretion and what influences their discretion in the professional role. Six qualitative interviews were conducted with social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> in three communitys i the middle of Sweden. The main result shows that it is primarily four factors that affect the social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> discretion in the professional role : External factors such as other organizations change of regulations and cooperation with other organizations. Organizational factors such as routines, rules and guidelines. Professional factors such as the opportunity to use experience and professional knowledge to determine which measure works in different situations. Individual factors like the workers ability for initiative and the clients individual circumstances. Social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> feel that they have a relatively wide discretion in their profession. They believe they have the ability to make individual evaluations of each client, however they also believe that their discretion often is limited by lack of time. Key words: social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers,</b> clients, discretion, assessments. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the personal viewpoints about corporal punishment of child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> in California???s Central Valley counties. This secondary analysis was part of a larger pre-existing study that examined child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers???</b> opinions and knowledge about physical punishment of children. The study was adapted from a study administered from the American Academy of Pediatrics. This quantitative study utilized an electronic survey that was distributed through Qualtrics Survey Software where participants had access to the survey through an email link. A total of 1, 125 participants started the survey and 971 participants completed the entire survey. A major finding of this study was that child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers???</b> personal opinions of corporal punishment influence their professional opinions of corporal punishment the majority of the time. Another major finding was that an overwhelmingly large majority of child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> support the use of corporal punishment by parents in the home. Future studies should explore whether an individual???s demographic variables, especially religious affiliation, influences child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers???</b> opinions and practices regarding corporal punishment. It would be additionally important to examine whether child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> have received any professional education or information regarding the effects of corporal punishment on children...|$|R
25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the {{conventional}} Boer forces, Kitchener succeeded Roberts as overall commander in November 1900. He was also promoted to lieutenant-general on 29 November 1900 and to local general on 12 December 1900. He subsequently inherited and expanded the successful strategies devised by Roberts to force the Boer commandos to submit, including concentration camps and the burning of farms. Conditions in the concentration camps, which had been conceived by Roberts as a form of control of the families whose farms he had destroyed, began to degenerate rapidly as the large influx of Boers outstripped the ability of the minuscule British force to cope. The camps lacked space, food, sanitation, medicine, and medical care, leading to rampant disease and a very high death rate for those Boers who entered. Eventually 26,370 women and children (81% were children) died in the concentration camps. The biggest critic of the camps was the Englishwoman, humanitarian, and <b>welfare</b> <b>worker</b> Emily Hobhouse.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this essay is to further {{investigate}} and describe psychological strains experienced by child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers.</b> The method used was qualitative interviews, two group interviews. The research aimed to understand how child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> were affected and handled the psychological strains generated by work through theory of coping and symbolic interactionism where humans are viewed as pragmatic actors. The research showed, as previous studies shown, that the child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> experience {{a great deal of}} psychological strains generated by high turnover in staff and pressuring work demands. The child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> felt inadequate and alone in their work tasks and experienced stress and anxiety. Coping was mainly used to regulate the emotional response of stressful situations instead of changing them, which is an effect of the limited possibilities to affect the working conditions. The support from colleagues was of limited resource but also an important coping strategy. The emotional strain of the high turnover in staff made the child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> distanced from new staff, which leaves the workers lacking more support. The authors of this essay believes that lack of support and increased workload, affected by the high turnover in staff, results in staff leaving child welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{perceptions}} and experiences of child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> in regard to immigrant and non-immigrant families by using the concept of corporal punishment as a point of departure. There were three main questions and objectives that focused on exploring the expectations and approaches that child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> have when working with immigrant and non-immigrant families. This study was exclusively qualitative in nature. Data collection was done by undertaking semi-structured interviews with seven child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> from the Stavanger and Sola offices. Thematic analysis was used to generate the findings which were discussed with the lens provided by the theoretical framework that included the moral theories of universalism and relativism as well as the theory of street level bureaucracy. The results of the study indicate that child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> have a child centred approach to their practice. They do not seem to differentiate between children of immigrant and non-immigrant families. Their work is based on the promotion of the rights of the child stated by the UNCRC and the Norwegian law. In addition, it was found that while child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> have a culture blind approach to the use of corporal punishment, they take culture into account to develop a better understanding and relationship with immigrant families. This was explained with the help of a graphic that I called “the bridge of relativism”...|$|R

40|$|This article, {{which grew}} out of a series of 11 focus groups with child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> and supervisors, explores how legal ethics may {{increase}} the stress child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> experience in carrying out their duties and may contribute to high rates of turnover. A number of workers experienced their interaction with lawyers and the legal system as extremely stressful. Others misunderstood the role of a lawyer. This article considers the various sources of legal and social work ethics and standards of practice at work in lawyer-social worker interaction in the child welfare context and provides a comparison of legal ethics with social work ethics on a number of dimensions. Ethical issues such as defining the client, confidentiality, client loyalty and zealous advocacy are considered. Additionally, issues which are not specifically ethical in nature but are closely related are considered. These include efforts to be objective in handling the work, the personal affront experienced by many child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> when their judgment is called into question and methods of communication. The article concludes {{that there is a need}} for training to assist child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> to understand legal ethics and how they contribute to high turnover rates. ...|$|R
