5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E

5|$|On November20, {{shortly before}} the {{tropical}} depression intensified into a tropical storm, the government of Honduras issued a tropical storm warning for the Swan Islands, along with a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> the northwestern Honduran coastline. The advisories were discontinued within 10hours of Keith's passage through the region. The government of Belize briefly declared a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> the whole coastline of the country, but {{when it became clear}} that Keith posed little threat, the watch was canceled. About 16hours before the storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> much of the coastline of Quintana Roo. Six hours later, a tropical storm warning replaced the watch, and it was extended west to Progreso, Yucatán; a hurricane watch was also posted. Cuban officials issued a bulletin on the night of November20, advising that tropical storm conditions would spread over the west part of Cuba.

Early on November8, the tropical storm warning and hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> Mexico were modified to include areas from Punta Allen to Playa del Carmen and Tulum to Playa del Carmen respectively. A hurricane warning was also declared for areas between Playa del Carmen and Cabo Catoche. Later that day, the tropical storm warning for Grand Cayman was discontinued as Ida moved away from the island.

Later that day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Oahu. By early on August7, the tropical storm warning was extended to include Kauai, placing all of the main Hawaiian islands under some form of tropical cyclone warning. The potential for flooding also resulted in the issuance of a flash flood <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> the entirety the island chain. By August9, all warnings were lifted as Iselle no longer posed a threat to the islands.|$|E

5|$|On September 16, 44hours before Hurricane Isabel made {{landfall}} on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> the entire coastline of Delaware. The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> the coastline. On September 17, 26hours before Isabel made landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings. While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane, forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155miles (250km) south-southeast of Lewes as a 115mph (185km/h) major hurricane. Though located within the cone of uncertainty, all subsequent forecasts predicted a landfall on North Carolina with the hurricane passing {{to the west of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|The Guam National Weather Service office {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> the Marshall Islands shortly after Pongsona developed into {{a tropical storm}}, and a day later watches were issued for Chuuk. On December 5, the service issued tropical storm warnings for parts of the Federated States of Micronesia. As Pongsona became a typhoon, the Guam National Weather Service office issued a typhoon <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning about 23hours prior to the onset of tropical storm-force winds; typhoon warnings were also issued for the unpopulated island of Agrihan. By one day before the typhoon moved through the Mariana Islands, JTWC predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area. Despite a more westward track than anticipated, forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of December 8, when forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands. As a result, many citizens felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon.|$|E
