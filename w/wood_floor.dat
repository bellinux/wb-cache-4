40|$|Summary This research, {{based on}} the theory of market structure, is {{intended}} to discuss the market structure in Taiwan <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> industry. To decide the market structure, the market concentration ratio method was introduced. Also, the factors of the entry barriers that will affect the market structure on <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> industry was examined. As a result, {{there are two types}} of wood floorings, solid and laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> in Taiwan market. The sales volume of solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> are 2 million 637 thousand square meters and laminated are 1 million 815 thousand square meters in 1997. The solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is mainly used in the residential area, and the laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is mainly used in the public area. The characteristics of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> considered by consumer are stability, shallow color and no defective. The solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> two and three level of distribution channel are normally used. The laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> three level of distribution channel are normally used. As for the market structure analysis, the laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is identified as an oligopoly market. The market structure of solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is a competitive market. 摘 要 本研究主要目的在於以市場的背景現況及市場結構理論，來探 討臺灣木質地板的市場結構形態。研究中透過實地調查瞭解市場的 現況，並以市場集中度衡量臺灣木質地板市場結構，同時以市場進 入障礙來檢視國內木質地板市場結構之變化。經由調查得知，臺灣 木質地板市場主要分為實木地板與銘木地板兩類。目前木質地板 1997 年的銷售量，實木地板約為 81 萬坪，銘木地板約為 55 萬坪。以使 用場所而言，實木地板多用於一般家庭，而銘木地板多用於公共場 所。而在材種選擇的偏好上，消費者主要以材質穩定性、材面色淺 均勻無缺點為選擇重點。在配銷通路上，實木地板為二階與三階的 通路，而銘木地板為三階的通路。另外以市場結構分析臺灣木銘木 地板市場為大型製造商所形成之寡占市場，具高規模經濟性，因此 有高的進入障礙，而獲利性高，不過風險比較大；實木地板市場為 小型經銷商組成之競爭性市場，市場進入障礙低，產品差異性亦低， 因此獲利性也較低，但風險則相對較穩定...|$|R
50|$|All timber <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> {{are made}} from sawn wood and {{are the most common}} {{category}} of engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> They do not use rotary-peeled veneer, composite wood (such as HDF), or plastic in their construction.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the fuzzy}} {{semantic}} theory, {{the questionnaire was}} designed to understand the visual evaluations of consumers for the 12 species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> and the aforementioned fuzzy numerical computation formula {{was applied to the}} result to calculate the total utility value of each visual evaluation of every type of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> Moreover, the obtained values were used to produce diagrams and tables for further comparing and analyzing the visual images of the 12 species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> and are provided for designers and consumers as a reference to <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> selection in the hope of obtaining the products which best meet consumers’ demand.|$|R
25|$|A solid <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> is a floor laid with planks or battens {{created from}} {{a single piece of}} timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses {{moisture}} from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Linda Atiyeh {{acquired}} the historic property and began extensive renovations, including removing a drop ceiling to uncover original skylights, un-bricking original windows, installing new electrical, heating/cooling and lighting systems, painting and restoring the exterior storefront, and uncovering and restoring the original <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> using vintage floor planks reclaimed from a historic building in Kentucky. Gallery 30 opened for {{business in the}} newly restored building at 26-28 York Street in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Intermodal {{containers}} are {{not strong}} enough for conversion to underground bunkers without additional bracing, as the walls cannot sustain much lateral pressure and will collapse. Also, the wooden floor of many used containers could contain some fumigation residues, rendering them unsuitable as confined spaces, such as for prison cells or bunkers. Cleaning or replacing the <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> can make these used containers habitable, with proper attention to such essential issues as ventilation and insulation.|$|E
30|$|Experts conduct visual {{analyses}} through physical quantity, {{so their}} {{opinions on the}} visual images of wood tend to be consistent whereas {{the opinions of the}} general public are not. Through the comparison of the former studies, traditional measuring scale was mostly employed to manage the variability of human thinking that might not exactly reflect the implicit phenomenon of decision making. In summary, this study was aimed to employ objective research methods to analyze different species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> and different visual psychological feelings of human beings, investigate different human visual images evaluations for <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> and compare the visual images of different <b>wood</b> <b>floors</b> by suitable semantic adjectives. We used fuzzy algorithm to analyze the visual image evaluations of each type of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> The result is in hopes of providing for relevant business owners, designers, and consumers as a reference to <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> selection.|$|R

30|$|The {{aforementioned}} research {{result can}} be applied to future practice. The data of different <b>wood</b> species of <b>flooring</b> in each visual evaluation can be used to establish relevant databases. Furthermore, computer programs can be employed to design decision support systems which can be provided for consumers, so when they choose <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> they can find suitable <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> speedily according to their personal preferences for visual images. Designers can also accurately convey their concepts and what consumers want mentally. Further research and investigations can be aimed at the visual images of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> combining with interior furniture and colors.|$|R

25|$|The {{value of}} the armory as a public venue greatly {{decreased}} {{with the construction of}} the Duluth Arena-Auditorium in 1966, which had more seating and modern amenities. In 1977, the National Guard announced plans to build a new armory in Duluth and in 1978, the city purchased the historic armory from the state for $160,000. The Head House was used for offices and the Drill Hall served as a garage for maintenance vehicles. The Drill Hall also stored some raw materials, and its original <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> no longer exists.|$|E
25|$|A most {{significant}} feature of Ponce High School is its two-story high, elongated auditorium, which {{also contains a}} generous stage area and a U-shaped wood mezzanine supported from the concrete ceiling. Its original lighting fixtures were removed and replaced by fluorescent ones. Classrooms are well lit and ventilated; there are many openings. Walls are plain, having been painted over and over throughout the years. The original <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> finish is still retained in the library, the auditorium, {{and many of the}} classrooms; some have been substituted or changed to concrete. Hallways and stairs are paved in concrete. Vinyl flooring is used at offices. Glazed concrete tile is found at the lobby, where the original iron grilles, of geometrical design, are still in use.|$|E

30|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> {{makes people}} feel exquisite, comfortable, warm, and natural. It is also {{visually}} harmonious, beautiful, and antibacterial. Thus, it is favored {{and used by}} people in architecture and interior decoration, and the usage amount is increased. The statistical data of Customs Administration, Ministry of Finance, Taiwan, display the total import and export annual average amount during 2003 – 2012 was approximately 4, 870  tons, which was worth US$ 13  million dollars. Based on Lin’s [2] interviews with <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> traders, the average monthly use of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> in Taiwan is approximately 530, 000  m 2, namely 39, 505  tons.|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the three flooring materials linoleum, vinyl <b>flooring</b> and solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> during their life cycles was assessed and compared through life cycle assessment (LCA). The scenarios used describe a Swedish situation. Only impacts on the natural environment were studied The quantitative results of the inventory analysis were evaluated by using three different assessment methods. According to the results, solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> proved to be clearly the most environmentally sound flooring. Linoleum was ranked as more environmentally sound than vinyl flooring, although this was less evident in comparison with ranking the solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{middle bay}} {{was used for}} {{unloading}} hay wagons, threshing (thrashing) grain and other work. The foundation was typically not quarried stone but fieldstone and had no basement thus are called a ground barn. The timbers used were typically one solid piece running {{the full length of}} the building sometimes over forty feet long. The cows often stood on the ground rather than on a <b>wood</b> <b>floor,</b> their heads facing the middle bay in what is called a tie-up (not individual box stalls). Also the breeds of cows were usually smaller than today. English barns were built before the New England practice of connecting the barn to the house was popular so these barns are usually separate from the house although they could have been connected to the house at a later date. Houses and barns in New England built before the early 19th century typically face south rather than facing a road, the later orientation.|$|E
25|$|Thirteen steel columns, {{arranged}} in a circle {{in the center of}} the building, support the dome overhead. The columns are irregularly spaced to accommodate building's site and avoid blocking entrances. Horizontal steel beams run outward from these columns to the outer walls, supporting the upper floors. Each of the columns was coated in a thick layer of plaster, with vertical conduits and air ducts embedded and hidden in the plaster. On the first floor, the plaster-coasted columns were clad in marble, but merely painted on the second and third floors. Each of the upper floors was constructed with a concrete base, on top of which were placed brick and red tile arched supports. A <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> was constructed atop the arched supports, and in parts of the second floor marble tile was laid atop the wood flooring. Intricate embossed bronze brackets supported the second-floor balcony. The first floor ceiling, formed by the second floor balcony, was decorated with highly detailed bronze coffers.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, 2001 {{the city}} of Edwardsville held a ground {{breaking}} ceremony to officially commence a restoration project aimed at returning {{the house to the}} most original condition possible. The eventual goal of the project was to furnish the home circa 1820s and open it as a house museum to the public. The restoration project, overseen by the firm St. Louis Tuckpointing and Painting, carried a price tag of more than $1 million; $150,000 to purchase the house, $725,000 in restoration costs and $215,000 to purchase a nearby gas station. Initially the project was to be completed by December 2003, but by April 2004 most of the exterior work had been finished with interior plastering and <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> installation remaining. The restoration was nearly totally completed by the time the official dedication ceremony occurred on July 12, 2006, more than six years after the purchase of the house by the city.|$|E

30|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the visual evaluations of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> The selected 12 species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> were simulated by computer and combined with the 6 sets of visual image adjectives to design a questionnaire and survey the visual evaluations of consumers. Triangular fuzzy number of fuzzy theory was employed to obtain the scores of the 12 species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> in the 6 visual image evaluations. The {{results showed that the}} differences between different species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> in the visual evaluation were less significant in terms of “classical and primitive”, “durable and practical”, and “natural and original”. However, the differences were more significant in terms of “Elegant and Soft”, “close and comfortable”, and “tender and amiable”. Furthermore, six groups with relative overall visual images were induced from the comparison of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> by qualitative classification. For example, the overall visual images of Quercus rubra, Acer saccharum and Quercus alba were similar, and they were more “Elegant and Soft”,“durable and practical”,“close and comfortable”, and “tender and amiable”. The overall visual images of Carya ovata, Pinus rigida and Castanea sativa were similar, and they tended to be “classical and primitive” and “natural and original”.|$|R
500|$|When it opened, the Capitol {{structure}} was {{large enough to}} host all the state agencies and departments. Due {{to the growth of}} state government, however, only the offices of Senate and House leadership, and ceremonial offices for the governor and lieutenant governor remain in the capitol. The ground floor corridors led to [...] "store rooms" [...] designed by the architect in the original building plans. This includes an armory in the southwest corner of the south corridor. The original <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> has been replaced by gray tiles. The rooms were originally lit with gas fixtures, though by 1900, the building had been refitted with electric lights. Today, the ground floor is home to several offices, including the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House, and the Capitol Tours and Information Service.|$|E
2500|$|It {{used to be}} {{difficult}} to maintain a <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> properly. However, if the directions of the floor manufacturer are followed properly modern treatments will maintain a good surface. It is important not to just trust a commercial office cleaner to know how to do a good job, they should be instructed to follow the directions. There are no cheap and foolproof machines around for measuring traction which would enable cleaners to see their work conforms to dance or sports requirements. [...] Thus there is a very strong inclination for managers or cleaners to go for other requirements e.g. a shiny surface or one that resists dirt better.|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} part of the museum complex is the Rogerio Casas-Alatriste H. Library, named after the first director.

40|$|High-density wood is {{required}} in <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> especially in engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> (EWF) designed for heavy-duty applications. However, high-density wood resources are limited and their cost is high. A densification treatment {{makes it possible for}} low- or moderate-density woods to replace harder species by modifying them into high-performance and high-value products, such as engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> for heavy-duty applications. The general objective {{of this study was to}} develop a prototype of engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> using sugar maple hygro-thermally densified surface layers. The results showed that thin sugar maple lumber densified at 200 °C under the combined effects of steam, heat, and pressure with a heat-resistant fabric had great potential for the manufacturing of engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> for heavy-duty use. As a result of treatment, it acquired high density, improved mechanical properties, and it had a relatively high dimensional stability and an attractive color. Tests in conditioning rooms showed that the EWF with a densified sugar maple (Acer saccharum March.) surface layer presented the lowest amplitude distortion between the dry and humid conditions compared with the standard EWF (0. 15 mm vs. 0. 17 mm and 0. 25 mm) ...|$|R

Examples of closed applications include coolants and insulating fluids (transformer oil) for transformers and capacitors, {{such as those}} used in old fluorescent light ballasts, hydraulic fluids, lubricating and cutting oils, etc. In contrast, the major open application of PCBs was in carbonless copy ("NCR") paper, which even nowadays results in paper contamination. Other open applications were as plasticizers in paints and cements, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical cables and electronic components, pesticide extenders, reactive flame retardants and sealants for caulking, adhesives, <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> finishes, such as Fabulon and other products of Halowax in the U.S., de-dusting agents, waterproofing compounds, casting agents. It was also used as a plasticizer in paints and especially [...] "coal tars" [...] that were used widely to coat water tanks, bridges and other infrastructure pieces.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, {{there was}} an {{inventory}} of the images in the Church: at the time there existed 40 figures in wood and stone, located in various niches and altares in the sub-choir, nave, presbytery and dependent annexes. Considering {{the condition of the}} structure, it was determined that the organ, should be removed from the site and installed in the Church of Freixo de Espada-à-Cinta. But, still, water infiltration and humidity continued to degrade the pavement and stonework of the presbytery. In 1954, the tiles were repaired, which included the consolidation and painting of the Chapel of Senhor dos Passos, repair of the walls, ceilings and access corridor towards the Rua dos Bacalhoeiros. [...] Similar repairs were completed in 1955, including the painting of the doors, re-plastering the interior and exterior surfaces, and new wood floors in the sacristy. The roof was repaired between 1965–67. Yet, in 1959, the Prior denounced the state of degradation in the sacrsity, the access corridor towards the Rua dos Bacalhoeiros and the floor in the presbytery. The DGEMN, then, substituted the <b>wood</b> <b>floor</b> in the presbytery for stone; resurfaced the walls of the corridor access and sacristy's vestibule; oil painted the doors, panels and ceilings; cleaned the arcade; and painted the walls with water-based paints and an insulator.|$|E
