40|$|<b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>Science</b> of Sound. This {{course is}} {{offered as a}} regular class Fall Semesters on the USU campus in Logan, Utah. It is also {{available}} over the internet Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters, or as a yearlong independent-studies course. In each case, work is submitted using the internet. The only difference in the regular class held Fall semester is that students meet with the professor {{three times a week}} to discuss the material in the text. A teaching assistant is assigned to answer questions via the internet. The course consists of reading the text, supplementing concepts using the Internet, solving homework problems based on the reading, and taking exams over the internet. There are 8 modules representing 8 different aspects of sound. You will complete 5 of the 8 modules for the course (Modules 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). The other 3 modules (Modules 4, 7, and 8) are optional, but may be completed to increase your point total. To complete a module you will need to 1) read the chapters in the text associated with the module; 2) submit a homework assignment consisting of problems selected from each chapter; and 3) pass an exam based on the material presented in the module. Note: If you have any problems viewing the material in this course, make sure you have the Macromedia Flash and Real Player...|$|E

This year marks the opening of the CASIS Reference Library in Building 272, and we encourage all attendees to stop by for a look and to make use of it in the future. The Technical Program covers a wide variety of applications at LLNL including physical systems for collecting data and processing techniques for recovering and enhancing images. We hope that you enjoy the presentations, and we encourage you to participate in the discussions. Thanks for attending...|$|R
