40|$|Lowering {{the gear}} {{reduction}} in actuators by utilizing high-torque low-speed motors enables {{the use of}} less expensive and simpler gear systems and decreases the overall system inertia. Variable reluctance machines can produce high torque at low speeds. Their static torque, a critical quantity for determination of low speed operation, is colnpared for three variable reluctance motor design variations using linear analysis. Saturation effects, which are crucial to the accurate determination of static torque, are modeled using a dual energy technique first proposed by Lord Rayleigh. Dual energy techniques utilizing flux tubes and magnetomotive force slices are developed into a numerical method for predicting nonlinear three-dimensional magnetostatic field parameters. The dual energy method offers a compromise between the accurate but laborious finite element method and the speed of simplified lumped parameter magnetic circuit calculations. A two-dimensional dual energy model of a variable reluctance motor is developed. Results of calculations on a 4 kW Oulton machine are compared to measurements and other calculation methods. Finally, as a demonstration, the model is used to evaluate two competing variable reluctance motors for use as replacements for a DC <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|E
40|$|December 2004. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 18) As {{part of a}} field operational test, 96 {{drivers were}} lent instrumented vehicles for approximately 26 days. During this time, a variety of measures regarding vehicle use were recorded, including <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> use, wiper setting adjustments, and headway time margin to preceding vehicles. <b>Windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> activity was examined in detail {{in order to provide}} data regarding the naturalistic use of <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> systems. The results have implications for the design and durability of <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers,</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>motors,</b> <b>windshields,</b> and glazing treatments (such as hydrophobic coatings). Overall, <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> were used 8. 6 % of the time the vehicles were being operated. Across all conditions, the slowest intermittent setting was the most frequently usedâ€”whereas the fastest continuous setting was used the least. When ambient lighting diminished, a shift towards higher wiper speeds was observed. Average headway time margin and range increased, and speed decreased, when <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> were engaged. Middle-aged drivers used wipers more often than either their younger or older counterparts. Finally, older females used their wipers the least amongst female drivers, while male drivers used wipers fairly uniformly across age groups...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{guides the}} reader through {{the design of}} an {{inexpensive}} XY stage for abrasive water jet cutting machine starting {{with a set of}} functional requirements and ending with a product. Abrasive water jet cutting allows for mass customization of 2 D parts, such as inlaid tiles. Most water jet cutters are based on a prismatic-prismatic design (gantry type). In an effort {{to reduce the number of}} precision parts in the machine, a rotary-rotary parallel drive design is proposed. The proposed mechanism will be actuated by electric DC <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>motors</b> directly coupled to the links, this eliminates the need for gearing mechanisms that add up to the total cost and complexity of the design. Kinematics of the design is simulated for a working area of 310 mm x 310 mm. Dynamic analysis is performed and the concepts of decoupled and configuration invariant inertia are derived, simplified to a set of conditions on the kinematic structure/mass properties of the arm linkages and applied to significantly simplify the mechanism's control system. The XY stage was designed to be inexpensive and small enough to be placed in hardware stores, garages and small machine shops. A vision of water jet cutters sold in boxes stacked on shelves in Wal-Mart, available for all machinists, artists, schools, and industries might one day thus become a reality if the pumps could also be made cheaply. by Fadi Abu Ibrahim.

The <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> installed on the front windshield and worm gears are generally made of one mechanical part. The four-bar linkage of <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> of automobile is driven by motor through worm gears. The method of simulated annealing is a technique that has attracted significant attention as suitable for optimization problems of large scale, especially ones where a desired global extremum is hidden among many, poorer, local extrema. The simulated annealing algorithm with penalty strategy is adopted to solve the optimal model of windscreen wiper mechanism, thus motion accuracy of wiper mechanism is greatly increased, and the searching number is greatly decreased...|$|R
