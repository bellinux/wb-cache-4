6000|$|... "Most {{women know}} by {{instinct}} {{whether they can}} give it or not," [...] Lady Otway slipped in quickly, in rather a low voice, as if she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> said while her sister-in-law's attention was diverted. [...] "And if not--well then, my advice would be--don't marry." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marlowe also painted. A 1962 work {{entitled}} A Slight Misfit featured {{fragments of}} {{a portrait of}} actress Marilyn Monroe that Marlowe had painted then torn up. He then [...] "pasted the pieces into a jumble of newspaper and magazine clips." [...] Marlowe told Life magazine that he created this collage because [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> misfiting face... on a background of the press." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it is {{very odd}} that just when I had decided to go myself you should {{want to do what}} I {{proposed}} long ago. If I wait for you to go tomorrow another day will be lost; and I know I shall be unable to rest another night without having been. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> settled, and will.

6000|$|... 250. I repeat--for I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> {{clear to}} you--Botticelli wants, {{with as little}} engraving, as much Sibyl as possible. For his head is full of Sibyls, and his heart. He can't draw them fast enough: one comes, and another and another; and all, gracious and {{wonderful}} and good, to be engraved forever, if only he had a thousand hands and lives. He scratches down one, with no haste, with no fault, divinely careful, scrupulous, patient, but with as few lines as possible. 'Another Sibyl--let me draw another, for heaven's sake, before she has burnt all her books, and vanished.' ...|$|E

"I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> gun on that house," [...] said Bai-Jove-Judson, {{indicating}} the superior dwelling over whose flat roof floated {{the blue and}} white flag. The little twin screws kicked up the water exactly as a hen's legs kick in the dust before she settles down to a bath. The little boat moved un easily from left to right, backed, yawed again, went ahead, and at last the gray blunt gun's nose was held as straight as a rifle-barrel on the mark indicated. Then Mr. Davies allowed the whistle to speak as it {{is not allowed to}} speak in Her Majesty's service on account of waste of steam. The soldiery of the village gathered into knots and groups and bunches, and the firing up the hill ceased, and every one except the crew of the flatiron yelled aloud. Something like an English cheer came down wind.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, Kunawicz {{currently}} {{serves as}} editor-in-chief of Mango Jam, a serial Comic book made by independent Comic book publisher Mango Comics. Mango Jam is marketed as the Philippines' first all-girls comics, created by girls. [...] "The entire crew is all female, all Pinay," [...] says Kunawicz. [...] "...And even if we're competing against big-name international titles, we're proud of every issue that flies off the shelf!" [...] "The publisher {{saw an opportunity}} {{in the market for}} young women comic book readers and they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> message of girl power across, and there was no better way to do it than start off with women writers and women artists." ...|$|R

[...] "It is {{difficult}} to arrange, for he does not like toadies, which is so unreasonable, for I know many toadies who are very pleasant. Treeby is with him now, and that is excellent, for Treeby contradicts him, and is scientific as well as fashionable, and gives him the last news of the Sun {{as well as of}} White's. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> great African traveller to go down to him; but one can hardly send a perfect stranger as a guest. I wanted Treeby to take him, but Treeby refused--men are so selfish. Treeby could have left him there, and the traveller might have remained a week, told all he had seen, and as much more as he liked. My lord cannot stand Treeby more than two days, and Treeby cannot stand my lord for a longer period, and that is why they are such friends." ...|$|E

He is {{just come to}} the state when it all turns on getting him off to sleep quietly, and not {{disturbing}} him, and she is too excited and restless {{to do anything with}} her; she has startled him twice already, and then gets upset--tired out, poor thing! and will end in being hysterical if she does not get fed and rested, and then we shall be done for! Now I want you to take charge of her. See, here's her room, and I have ordered up some tea for her. You must get her quieted down, make her have a tolerable meal, and when she has worked off her excitement, put her to bed--undressed, mind--and you might lie down by her. If you can't manage her, call me. That's Leonard's door, and I shall be there all night; but don't if you can help it. Can you do this, or must I get Miss [...] "What-d'ye-call-her" [...] the elder one, if she can leave the Greens in Randall's Alley? ...|$|E
6000|$|Has Mr. Tulkinghorn {{any idea}} of this himself? It may be so, or it may not, but there is this {{remarkable}} circumstance to be noted in everything associated with my Lady Dedlock {{as one of a}} class--as one of the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes herself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of ordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks so. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to the manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices, follies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new custom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new dwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are deferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects of nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage {{her as if she were}} a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their lives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience, lead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook all and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet of the majestic Lilliput. [...] "If you want to address our people, sir," [...] say Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady Dedlock and the rest--"you must remember that you are not dealing with the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest place, and their weakest place is such a place." [...] "To make this article go down, gentlemen," [...] say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to their friends the manufacturers, [...] "you must come to us, because we know where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it fashionable." [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> print upon the tables of my high connexion, sir," [...] says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, [...] "or if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion, sir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for I have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion, sir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my finger"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not exaggerate at all.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2011, Mansoor {{elaborated}} on {{the forthcoming}} albums in Australian magazine Mixdown. He confirmed {{that there would}} be two albums recorded, and that one would be a concept album. Mansoor has had an interest in a concept album for quite some time, stating that [...] "he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> concept album out there. It's been an idea for years and years." [...] Mansoor also revealed that the band would release the albums separately, saying [...] "they'll probably do a staggered release, three to six months apart" [...] and that [...] "he really <b>wants</b> them <b>to</b> be these separate bodies of work, because they will sound different, and be completely different approaches, too." ...|$|R

6000|$|April 16th! It's {{really too}} dismal, dearest Alice, that, {{breaking}} off the above at the hour I had to, I {{have been unable}} to go on with it for so many days. It's now more than a fortnight old; still, though my check was owing to my having of a sudden, just as I rested my pen, to drop perversely into a less decent phase (than I reported to you at the moment of writing) and [from which I] have had with some difficulty to wriggle up again, I am now none the less able to send you no too bad news. I have wriggled up a good deal, and still keep believing in my capacity to wriggle up in general.... Suffice if for the moment that I just couldn't, for the time, drive the pen myself--when I am [...] "bad" [...] I feel too demoralised, too debilitated, for this; and it doesn't at all do for me then to push against the grain. Don't feel, all the same, that if I resort this morning to the present help, it is because I am not feeling differently--for I really am in an easier way again (I mean of course specifically and [...] "anginally" [...] speaking) and the circumstances of the hour a good deal explain my proceeding thus. I had yesterday a Birthday, an extraordinary, prodigious, portentous, quite public Birthday, of all things in the world, and it has piled up acknowledgments and supposedly delightful complications and arrears at such a rate all round me that in short, Miss Bosanquet being here, I today at least throw myself upon her aid for getting on correspondentially--instead of attending to my proper work, which has, however, kept going none so badly in spite of my last poor fortnight. I will tell you in a moment of my signal honours, but want to mention first that your good note written on receipt of A Small Boy has meanwhile come to me and by the perfect fulness of its appreciation gave me the greatest joy. There are several things I want to say to you about the shape and substance of the book--and I will yet; only now I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> off absolutely by today's American post, and tell you about the Honours, a little, before you wonder, in comparative darkness, over whatever there may have been in the American papers that you will perhaps have seen; though in two or three of the New York ones more possibly than in the Boston. I send you by this post a copy of yesterday's Times and one of the Pall Mall Gazette--the two or three passages in which, together, I suppose to have been more probably than not reproduced in N. Y. But I send you above all a copy of the really very beautiful Letter ... ushering in the quite wonderful array of signatures (as I can't but feel) of my testifying and [...] "presenting" [...] friends: a list of which you perhaps can't quite measure the very charming and distinguished and [...] "brilliant" [...] character without knowing your London better. What I wish I could send you is the huge harvest of exquisite, of splendid sheaves of flowers that converted a goodly table in this room, by the time yesterday was waning, into such a blooming garden of complimentary colour as I never dreamed I should, on my own modest premises, almost bewilderedly stare at, sniff at, all but quite [...] "cry" [...] at. I think I must and shall in fact compass sending you a photograph of the still more glittering tribute dropped upon me--a really splendid [...] "golden bowl," [...] of the highest interest and most perfect taste, which would, in the extremity of its elegance, be too proudly false a note amid my small belongings here if it didn't happen to fit, or to sit, rather, with perfect grace and comfort, on the middle of my chimney-piece, where the rather good glass and some other happy accidents of tone most fortunately consort with it. It is a very brave and artistic (exact) reproduction of a piece of old Charles II plate; the bowl or cup having handles and a particularly charming lid or cover, and standing on an ample round tray or salver; the whole being wrought in solid silver-gilt and covered over with quaint incised little figures of a (in the taste of the time) Chinese intention. In short it's a very beautiful and honourable thing indeed.... Against the giving to me of the Portrait, presumably by Sargent, if I do succeed in being able to sit for it, I have absolutely and successfully protested. The possession, the attribution or ownership of it, I have insisted, shall be only their matter, that of the subscribing friends. I am sending Harry a copy of the Letter too--but do send him on this as well. You see there must be good life in me still when I can gabble so hard. The Book appears to be really most handsomely received hereabouts. It is being treated in fact with the very highest consideration. I hope it is viewed a little in some such mannerly light roundabout yourselves, but I really call for no [...] "notices" [...] whatever. I don't in the least want 'em. What I do want is to personally and firmly and intimately encircle Peg and Aleck and their Mother and squeeze them as hard together as is compatible with squeezing them so tenderly! With this tide of gabble you will surely feel that I shall soon be at you again. And so I shall! Yours, dearest Alice, and dearest all, ever so and ever so! ...|$|E

His {{selection}} was surprising, as he replaced George Cunningham, who had captained Scotland to victory against [...] in the preceding game. Yet, there was a sentiment in the South Wales Daily Post that his inclusion, alongside four other changes, strengthened the team, and the Welsh Evening Express {{ahead of the game}} described him as [...] "a young player of fine ability... and very smart at getting the ball away to his threequarters." [...] The match, which the Welsh won 14-0, was played in [...] "dismal and depressing conditions". With ten minutes left of the game, and Wales leading 11-0, Milroy made a run for the Welsh tryline, but was brought down before crossing the line. Asked for an interview after the match, he said: [...] "No thanks, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> mud off. Congrats to Wales."

One {{hundred and fifty}} firefighters battled the 4-alarm blaze, which did not spread {{to the inside of}} the showroom, {{although}} it devastated the warehouse.

Gillham, age 66, is a former Gallery Furniture employee who was fired in 2007. [...] In 2011, Gillham, who had been incarcerated since his arrest, was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial by an expert.
