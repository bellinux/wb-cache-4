5|$|In {{a modern}} note {{written on a}} {{fly-leaf}} {{at the end of}} the book it is said that the author of the Chronicle was one Gregory Skinner (meaning William Gregory of the Skinners' Company) who was Mayor of London in 1451, the thirtieth year of Henry VI. And when <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the Chronicle itself the fact seems to be pretty well borne out by what the author himself says in the record of that year.|$|E
5|$|A social {{rational}} for the Hindu {{concept of}} rebirth in Hell {{is evident in}} the metric work of the Manusmrti: a written discourse focused on the “law of the social classes”. A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. For this <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences. An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise way in which a person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows (such as fasting, water purification rituals, chanting, and even sacrifices). These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in. These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior.|$|E

60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Foulata. The {{poor girl}} was {{stabbed in the}} body, and I saw {{that she could not}} live long.|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} silent when Sarah finished. So far, then, we {{had succeeded in}} our search. What was to be done next? <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> papa.|$|R
5000|$|Penny also blamed {{a priest}} for what {{happened}} to her son, saying, [...] "With our son, when we first found out that he was smoking marijuana, <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the young priest whom my son idolized, my son {{was the head of the}} youth group. And <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> him for help because we thought our son would listen to him. And he said, 'I am not a psychologist. He needs a psychologist.' That was the beginning of the end, going to a psychologist. These were the hurts." ...|$|R
25|$|This form {{suggests}} {{that if we can}} find a function ψ whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related {{to the study of the}} level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E

2500|$|Joel B. Green, in The Cambridge Companion to Jesus, {{says the}} {{evidence}} of the manner of Jesus' death is far more ambiguous than is generally realised. Literary sensibilities in Roman antiquity did not promote graphic descriptions of the act of crucifixion, and even the Gospels report simply, [...] "They crucified him," [...] adding no further detail. According to Green, the Romans were slaves to no standard technique of crucifixion: [...] "In describing the siege of Jerusalem by the Roman army, for example, Josephus reports that ‘the soldiers out of rage and hatred amused themselves by nailing their prisoners in different positions’ (J.W. 5.449–51). Elsewhere we learn that victims of crucifixion might be fixed to the stake in order to die, or impaled after death as a public display. They might be fixed to the cross with nails or with ropes. That Jesus was nailed to the cross is intimated in several texts (John 20.25; Acts 2.23; Col 2.14; Gos. Pet. 6.21; Justin Dial. 97). Nor can <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> archaeological evidence for assistance." ...|$|E

60|$|My mother {{smiled and}} thanked him. <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go. My mother hesitated in her walk; on the {{threshold}} of the room she glanced round at the bed, but she went on.|$|R
60|$|But if <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> pathology, {{it offers}} us some {{remarkable}} approximations to true Xenogenesis.|$|E
60|$|From Aditi, however {{she is to}} be interpreted, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{her famous}} children, the Adityas, the high gods.|$|E
60|$|This settled, Andrew {{asked for}} Clarrie. He was humbler now {{than he had}} been, and in our disappointments <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> woman for solace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl, as <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> leave the old orchard, [...] "I {{want to ask}} a favour of you all. Don't say good-bye to me {{tomorrow}} morning." ...|$|R

6000|$|And {{from this}} <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> a very {{different}} form in the [...] "Altaforte," [...] which is perhaps the best sestina that has been written in English: ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> behold an ungainly {{young man}} in an ill-fitting blue suit. His face was pimply, his eyes a Teutonic blue, his yellow hair rumpled, his {{naturally}} large mouth was made larger by a friendly grin.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{go out at}} the door, another {{previously}} invisible old man, {{a hoarse}} {{old man in a}} flannel gown, is standing there, {{as if he had just}} come up through the floor.|$|E
60|$|A {{while we}} must leave Tom {{in the hands}} of his persecutors, while <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> pursue the {{fortunes}} of George and his wife, whom we left in friendly hands, in a farmhouse on the road-side.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the figure}} in the corner, and there is such a light on his face that we shade our eyes. He is smoking the Arcadia, and as he smokes the tragedy of Hamlet takes form in his brain.|$|E
60|$|It was {{twilight}} when <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go, {{and then}} I saw {{that many of}} the warehouses along the wharves were heaps of ruins. My father said this was that the town might be the better defended.|$|R
60|$|After {{them came}} utan upon utan of red men. The green horde broke to {{surround}} the temple. The red men charged for the interior, and then <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> continue our interrupted battle; but our foes had vanished.|$|R
60|$|Our guide grinned as he {{left the}} hut to execute his mission, and <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> {{converse}} on this new plan, which, the more we thought of it, seemed the more to grow in our estimation as most feasible.|$|R
60|$|These, {{and such}} other {{considerations}} not directly connected with our subject, I shall, perhaps, {{be able to}} press farther {{at the close of}} my work; meantime, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the immediate question, of the distinction between the lower and higher picturesque, and the artists who pursue them.|$|E
6000|$|... 70. From {{the head}} of the Dramatic branch of Art, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the first of the great Contemplative Triad, associated, as it most {{singularly}} happens in name as well as in heart; Orcagna--Arcagnuolo; Fra Giovanni--detto Angelico; and Michael Angelo:--the first two names being bestowed by contemporary admiration.|$|E
60|$|And if <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the {{possibilities}} of air-transport in the future we are forced towards the same conclusion, that {{the security of the}} British Empire must rest in the future not on its strength in warfare, but on its keeping the peace within and without its boundaries.|$|E
60|$|We ceased <b>to</b> gaze. <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> each other, {{the same}} thought, the same {{question}} in our eyes. For these plants to grow, {{there must be some}} air, however attenuated, air that we also should be able to breathe.|$|R
