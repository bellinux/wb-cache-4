40|$|Information Abstract- Cellular mobile {{networks}} will be {{more and}} more complemented by high speed <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspots.</b> In order to use this additional access technology efficiently, terminals must be able to discover the <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspots</b> located around them. Classical methods based on measurements on the physical network interface are not sufficient because they neither can detect neighbouring hotspots nor are they well-suited for multi-mode interfaces, which can use only one access technology at once. Therefore, we suggest to use a model-based access discovery method, which applies queries to a location-based data model. In this paper, we describe how to collect field strength measurement from mobile terminals, how to convert them to polygons describing the coverage of <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspots,</b> and how to retrieve the coverage information. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” Today, most <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspots</b> deploy {{multiple}} APs (Access Points) {{to improve}} the network performance and to provide fair and satisfactory services to clients. However, without a well-defined fairness objective function and the corresponding service provision schemes, the desired improvements may not be achieved. On the other hand, it has been realized that existing fairness notions proposed for single-AP <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspots</b> exhibit various performance anomalies in multi-AP wireless hotspots: bandwidth anomaly with Bandwidth-based Fairness (BbF) and association anomaly with Timeshare-based Fairness (TbF). To answer this challenge, we propose a new fairness notion, called the Fulfillment-based Fairness (FbF), for multi-AP <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspots.</b> It emphasizes allocation of bandwidth to clients in proportion to their respective maximum attainable bandwidth allocations. Extensive simulation shows that FbF outperforms BbF and TbF in terms of aggregate system throughput by up to 40 % and 70 %, respectively. It performs particularly well when the clients present {{a high degree of}} transmission rate diversity and/or in the presence of bottleneck clients that can only communicate with a single AP at low transmission rates.

One proposed solution, cyber foraging, uses remote computers located at <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspots</b> to execute application services on behalf of mobile computers. In this paper, we explore how portable storage can improve {{the performance of a}} cyber foraging infrastructure. Our approach uses portable storage to store snapshots of service state along with logs that are used for deterministic replay.

5000|$|Unlike most TLS {{implementations}} of HTTPS, such {{as on the}} World Wide Web, {{the majority}} of implementations of EAP-TLS require client-side X.509 certificates without giving the option to disable the requirement, even though the standard does not mandate their use. Some have identified this as having the potential to dramatically reduce adoption of EAP-TLS and prevent [...] "open" [...] but encrypted access points. On 22 August 2012 hostapd (and wpa_supplicant) added support in its Git repository for an UNAUTH-TLS vendor-specific EAP type (using the hostapd/wpa_supplicant project RFC 5612 Private Enterprise Number), and on 25 February 2014 added support for the WFA-UNAUTH-TLS vendor-specific EAP type (using the Wi-Fi Alliance Private Enterprise Number), which only do server authentication. This would allow for situations much like HTTPS, where a <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspot</b> allows free access and does not authenticate station clients but station clients wish to use encryption (IEEE 802.11i-2004 i.e. WPA2) and potentially authenticate the <b>wireless</b> <b>hotspot.</b> There have also been proposals to use IEEE 802.11u for access points to signal that they allow EAP-TLS using only server-side authentication, using the standard EAP-TLS IETF type instead of a vendor-specific EAP type.|$|E
