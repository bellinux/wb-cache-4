5|$|Because {{it would}} be {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of the}} proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.|$|E
