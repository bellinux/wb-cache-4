5|$|Due to {{the strain}} on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon most of the {{equipment}} and to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for lift-off. Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that there <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock and floating out into space to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{infrastructure}} {{has been}} completed, mostly on Genova and Hamburgo Streets, but residents {{complain that the}} work is too slow, hurting their businesses. There are fears that these interventions, along with those scheduled between 2010 and 2012, <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to save the area.|$|E
25|$|While {{peak demand}} in 2006 was below total {{installed}} capacity, it lay slightly above firm capacity. According to {{supply and demand}} projections by the World Bank, new generation capacity to be commissioned in the period 2007-2010 <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to meet demand growth, which means that an energy shortfall {{is likely to happen}} in the near future.|$|E

25|$|Money value fluctuates over time: $100 {{today has}} a {{different}} value than $100 in five years. This is because one can invest $100 today in an interest-bearing bank account or any other investment, and that money will grow/shrink due to the rate of return. Also, if $100 today allows the purchase of an item, {{it is possible that}} $100 <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to purchase the same item in five years, because of inflation (increase in purchase price).|$|E
25|$|Steel, {{carbon fiber}} and glass among others are usually {{considered}} linear materials, while other {{materials such as}} rubber and soils are non-linear. However, {{this is not an}} absolute classification: if very small stresses or strains are applied to a non-linear material, the response will be linear, but if very high stress or strain is applied to a linear material, the linear theory <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b> For example, as the linear theory implies reversibility, it would be absurd to use the linear theory to describe the failure of a steel bridge under a high load; although steel is a linear material for most applications, it is not in such a case of catastrophic failure.|$|E
500|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that the High Court also ruled that dual citizenship on its own <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to disqualify someone under s 44(i). [...] At paragraph 176, the High Court makes the point that a person must take reasonable steps to renounce their non-Australian citizenship. [...] If renunciation is not possible, for example by either the laws of the foreign power not permitting it or the process being unreasonable, then the person will not be disqualified by operation of s 44(i).|$|E
50|$|Parents {{should not}} put {{children}} into safety seats with thick winter coats on. The coat will flatten {{in an accident}} and the straps <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> snug <b>enough</b> to keep the child safe.

[...] Tancredo himself acknowledged that he is a one-issue candidate making the statement at a speech in to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), [...] "If you want to call me a single-issue candidate, that's fine, just so long as you know that my single issue is the survival and the success of the conservative movement in America." ...|$|E
500|$|Watney awakens {{after the}} storm to a low oxygen warning and {{makes his way to}} the [...] "Hab" [...] (short for [...] "habitat"), the crew's base of operations. [...] He removes the piece of antenna which {{destroyed}} his suit's biomonitor and lodged in his torso by performing self-surgery. [...] He begins a video diary and realizes that his only chance of rescue is to rendezvous with the Ares IV crew at the Schiaparelli crater, [...] away in four years. His immediate concern is there <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> food to survive that long. Watney, being a botanist, improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing Martian soil fertilized with human waste, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and potatoes intended for Thanksgiving dinner. He also begins to modify the only functional rover for longer journeys in preparation for the long distance travel.|$|E

30|$|Physics-based prognostics is {{preferred}} in online applications {{because of its}} high computational performance as well as prediction accuracy [9, 10]. However, it is too difficult, time consuming, and expensive to develop a physical model for complex systems. Even if the model <b>is</b> developed, it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> accurate <b>enough</b> due to assumptions and simplification during the development process.|$|R
2500|$|This {{occurs when}} an {{employee}} {{is subjected to}} comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as {{a regular part of}} the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both [...] "serious" [...] and [...] "frequent." [...] Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{systemic}} problems {{exposed in}} the Madoff prosecution have not improved remedies for fraud victims. Indeed, since the exposure, {{it has become}} far harder for a fraud victim to prevail. In 2009, the Supreme Court required a plaintiff to establish his claim before any disclosure is required by the defendant. [...] "Labels and conclusions" [...] and [...] "a formulaic recitation {{of the elements of}} a cause of action" [...] will not suffice. Thus, correct statements about fraud <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> by themselves to support a lawsuit; plaintiffs are required to have some actual evidence in order to proceed.|$|E
2500|$|As well, {{the problem}} of {{prerequisites}} extends to the playing of printed scenarios, many of which require components from multiple modules, particularly those scenarios released by third party publishers. For instance, the Order of Battle (OOB) from a module {{may be needed to}} play one module while a single map board from the same module may be required to play a particular scenario. [...] The Hollow Legions (HL) Module was originally intended to add on to West of Alamein (WOA) and as such the OOB from For King and Country <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to play all scenarios in HL as the WOA map boards are required as well. Furthermore, an MMP Action Pack is required for one module, a Historical Study.|$|E

2500|$|The narrator speaks at the game's ending, which varies {{based on}} the number of fruit the player {{retrieved}} during the game. If the player collects a minimum amount of fruit, the narrator states the explorers feel [...] "unease" [...] over the possibility the seeds collected <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to save Koppai. If the player also collects a respectable amount of fruit, it is stated that careful planning will be required to save Koppai. If the player collects all fruits, the narrator states that the three have successfully completed their mission to restore life in Koppai and that the cause of the Drake's crash-landing is unknown and suggests that it may be on purpose. In a post-credits scene, the Pikmin see a flaming object falling into the surface of PNF-404. Depending on the game's ending, Alph's final log entry states that Louie is stranded on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|When a cask {{has been}} tapped, the beer starts {{to come into}} contact with oxygen—and a beer in contact with oxygen has a limited life. Stronger beers last longer, but for most ales with an ABV in the low 4% region, three days is typical. [...] However, if proper cellar {{management}} is practised, including [...] "hard spiling" [...] beer between sessions, almost any genuine real ale should last around a week. [...] If the pub doesn't have a high turnover, or if a beer is not popular, three days <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to sell all the beer in the cask. A cask breather allows a small amount of CO2 to replace the oxygen in the cask. Not enough CO2 to push it up to the bar—that's [...] "top pressure"—but enough [...] "blanket pressure" [...] to keep the beer fresh tasting for longer by replacing some or most of the oxygen that has made it into the cask with CO2, an inert gas.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{liberation of}} Paris speech, de Gaulle argued [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> that, {{with the help}} of our dear and admirable Allies, we have got rid of him [...] from our home for us to be {{satisfied}} after what happened. We want to enter his territory as it should be, as victors", clearly showing his ambition that France be considered one of the World War II victors just like the Big Three. This perspective was not shared by the western Allies, as was demonstrated in the German Instrument of Surrender's First Act. The French occupation zones in Germany and in West Berlin cemented this ambition, leading to some frustration on the part of other European nations, which became part of the deeper Western betrayal sentiment. This sentiment was felt by other European Allies, especially Poland, whose proposition that they be part of the occupation of Germany was rejected by the Soviets; the latter taking the view that they had liberated the Poles from the Nazis which thus put them {{under the influence of the}} USSR.|$|E

Before the departure, she says that the death <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> strong <b>enough</b> to take the life of his brother.|$|R
5000|$|System {{storage is}} storage {{that will be}} present in all BD-J players. The {{required}} minimum size of this system storage will permit storage of application data like settings, high-scores etc. It <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> big <b>enough</b> to store downloaded AV material. For this purpose, optional local storage is available. Typically system storage will be implemented using Flash memory and the optional local storage will be implemented on a HDD.|$|R

5000|$|People {{have always}} adapted to climatic changes and some {{community}} coping strategies already exist, for example changing sowing times or adopting new water-saving techniques. Traditional knowledge and coping strategies {{must be maintained}} and strengthened, otherwise adaptive capacity may be weakened as local knowledge of the environment is lost. Strengthening these local techniques and building upon them also makes {{it more likely that}} adaptation strategies will be adopted, as it creates more community ownership and involvement in the process. [...] In many cases however this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to adapt to new conditions which are outside the range of those previously experienced, and new techniques will be needed. Current development efforts are increasingly focusing on community-based climate change adaptation, seeking to enhance local knowledge, participation and ownership of adaptation strategies.|$|R
30|$|The risk of {{adhesion}} formation can {{be reduced}} by good surgical practice such as avoiding bleeding, minimising tissue handling, reducing infection and contamination risk, reducing drying of tissues, limited use of cautery, limited use of sutures, avoiding foreign bodies and use of starch free gloves [3].
