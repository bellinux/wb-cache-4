5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} {{the study of}} Buddhism as <b>well.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> combination {{he was one of}} the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the fulfillment of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having more time to study the Dhamma.|$|E

A capable engineering officer, Capper served in India and Burma for most of the first 17 years of his career, principally employed on military and public construction projects.

5|$|Harith now counselled the khagan to take {{advantage}} of the dispersal of the Arab army to its winter quarters, and resume his advance. Following Harith's advice, in early December the khagan led the Turgesh army, 30,000 strong and comprising contingents from virtually every native ruler of Transoxiana and Upper Tokharistan, south, bypassing Balkh, into Guzgan, hoping to raise the Hephthalite princes of Lower Tokharistan in revolt as <b>well.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> he failed, as the king of Guzgan joined Asad, who was approaching with what forces he could muster. Asad's advance caught the khagan and Harith off guard: Asad came upon them near Kharistan when they were accompanied by only 4,000 men, the rest having scattered to plunder and forage. In the ensuing Battle of Kharistan, Asad routed the Turgesh. Harith, who fought with distinction, and the khagan barely escaped themselves and fled north over the Oxus. Asad's victory at Kharistan saved Arab rule in Central Asia. The Turgesh detachments south of the Oxus were largely destroyed piecemeal by Juday' al-Kirmani, ending the threat to Khurasan, and the loyalty of the native rulers of Tokharistan was cemented. The khagan′s prestige took a serious hit, which encouraged his domestic rivals, who were backed secretly by the Chinese. In early 738, the tarkhan Kursul assassinated Suluk, whereupon the Turgesh realm collapsed in civil war. Asad too died soon after, and was succeeded by Nasr ibn Sayyar in July 738.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, {{both the}} British Royal Navy and the French Navy {{despatched}} frigate squadrons to the Indian Ocean. The French, led by Commodore Jacques Hamelin, {{were ordered to}} disrupt British trade in the region, particularly targeting the large East Indiamen that carried millions of pounds worth of goods between Britain and her Empire. The British force under Commodore Josias Rowley was tasked with the blockade and eventual capture of the two well defended island bases of the French, Île Bonaparte and Isle de France. At the Action of 31 May 1809, a French frigate named Caroline captured two East Indiamen, sheltering with her prizes at Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte. In his first major operation against the islands, Rowley landed soldiers behind the defences of the harbour and sent his ships into the bay, seizing {{the town and the}} shipping in the harbour, including Caroline. One of Rowley's captains who had performed <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> engagement was Robert Corbet of HMS Nereide. Refitting the Caroline as a British warship and renaming her HMS Bourbonaise, Rowley placed Corbet in command and sent him to Britain with despatches.|$|E

5|$|In 737, Asad again led {{his troops}} {{north of the}} Oxus in a retaliatory {{campaign}} against Khuttal, whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the Turgesh. While Asad captured a few fortresses and pillaged the land, the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called for aid from the Turgesh khagan, Suluk. The Turgesh army's arrival caught the Arab troops, widely dispersed while ravaging the countryside, by surprise, and precipitated a headlong flight across the Oxus. The Turgesh followed after them and attacked and almost annihilated the Arab baggage train, which Asad had sent ahead. The timely arrival of Asad's main army saved the baggage train's remnants, before both sides settled for winter quarters. Ominously for the Arabs, the khagan remained in Khurasan instead of retiring north, and Harith now emerged from hiding and joined him. Harith now counselled the khagan {{to take advantage of}} the dispersal of the Arab army to its winter quarters, and to resume his advance. In early December the khagan led the Turgesh army, 30,000 strong with contingents from virtually every native ruler of Transoxiana and Upper Tokharistan, south. They bypassed Balkh and marched into Juzjan, hoping to raise the Hephthalite princes of Lower Tokharistan in revolt as <b>well.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> the Turgesh failed, as the king of Juzjan joined Asad, who was approaching with what forces he could muster.

5|$|The {{next ten}} matches {{prior to the}} Old Trafford Test were played mainly {{in the north of}} England and the Australians did very <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, through June and into early July. They lost only to the North by an innings at Old Trafford when their batting {{struggled}} against Ted Peate and Ulyett while good scores by A. N. Hornby and Barnes ensured the North's victory. Giffen had a memorable game when the Australians played Lancashire at Old Trafford, taking a hat trick in the Lancashire innings and then scoring 113. That match was drawn but the Australians defeated both Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire by the same three-wicket margin. Spofforth, Palmer, Peate and Tom Emmett dominated the match at Bradford in which only 255 runs were scored in total. At Trent Bridge, the bowling of Giffen and Palmer enabled the Australians to recover from a first innings deficit of 39 and win. In the return match against the Gentlemen at the Oval, the last three English batsmen including Lord Harris were all stumped by Jack Blackham.|$|E

The ball then came to Verge, who kicked towards the British halfback Bush, and Burdon took it and ran over the tryline for the opening score, with no conversion. The British {{levelled}} the score {{at the start of the}} second half with an unconverted try by Bush, and then immediately after, he scored a drop goal to put the visitors 3–7 ahead. The British added a further ten points to their tally, and won the match 3–17. Verge kicked <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> game, according to The Sunday Times.
