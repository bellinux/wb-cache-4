500|$|Carter {{called it}} a [...] "pleasure" [...] to cast Kate Luyben and April Telek, because they were [...] "good"-looking, which he felt was a {{refreshing}} change from frequently casting [...] "character actors" [...] on The X-Files. Luyben would later make an appearance on The X-Files and played a prominent role on Harsh Realm. The idea behind the character [...] "The Frenchman" [...] came from a prophecy by Nostradamus. According to Carter, [...] "the {{idea that there is}} something approaching at the millennium, this series being produced I think four years {{before the end of the}} century, that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> toward something grave and foreboding". The name of recurring character Bob Bletcher came from an attorney Carter had worked with previously. Another name, Giebelhouse was another name Carter had gotten from his childhood years. Carter said [...] "This idea of the hard-boiled detective is a kind of cliché". But felt that the characters came [...] "very real to life", when compared to real law enforcement personnel.|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{ended in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her then-untitled fourth studio album. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, worked on a track titled [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{and sent it to}} the singer. Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote [...] "Two Black Cadillacs", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him. Underwood said that [...] "it was so much fun to write and just be in that room" [...] with Lindsey and Kear, as they [...] "didn't really know what to expect or where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> or what we would end up with." [...] Kear described the writing session: ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E

2500|$|By 2004, {{these cuts}} had reduced federal tax revenues, as a {{percentage}} of the Gross Domestic Product, to the lowest level since 1959. With the NASDAQ crash and one quarter of negative growth in 2000 it was likely <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> into a recession, yet merely two years after the 2003 Bush tax cuts, federal revenues (in dollars) had reached a record high. [...] The effect of simultaneous record increases in spending and tax reductions was to create record budget deficits in absolute terms, though as recently as 1993, the deficit was slightly larger than the current 3.6% of the GDP. In the last year of the Clinton administration, the federal budget showed an annual surplus of more than US$230 billion. Under Bush, the government returned to deficit spending. The annual deficit reached an absolute record of US$374 billion in 2003 and then a further record of $413 billion in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{prepared}} about 18 {{songs for}} the album and {{teamed up with}} Swedish producers Mikael Nord Andersson an Martin Hansen. All the songs from the album are new written material, except four songs: [...] "Slave Me", [...] "No Limit", [...] "Turn You On" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] which were written during the recording sessions for Unbreakable. During those sessions [...] "Turn You On" [...] had a different title; [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] was planned to be recorded for the album following Unbreakable, but when the band received an offer from Desmond Child to record [...] they kept the song and recorded it for this album. James Kottak in the interview for Sleaze Roxx explained: [...] "The first four songs that we wrote for this record were actually dark. I call them dark songs because they were probably too heavy compared to the stuff we've done in the past. They were in the vein of [...] "The Good Die Young", but you can't have too many songs like that. I love [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] but I'm glad the way things evolved took us away from where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> initially in the songwriting process. We also co-wrote with our producers, Martin Hansen and Mikael Andersson, who took the whole thing to an entirely different level".|$|E

6000|$|The {{vibration}} of {{the monster}} ship increased to a strong, electric pulsation, the water hummed along her sides, she felt the swell of the open sea. A fine rain began to fall that hid the land--yes, and the life I was leaving. I made my way across the glistening deck to the saloon where, my newspapers and periodicals neglected, I sat all the morning beside a window gazing out at the limited, vignetted zone of waters around the ship. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> for the Old World. The wind rose, the rain became pelting, mingling with the spume of the whitecaps racing madly past: within were warmth and luxury, electric lights, open fires, easy chairs, and men and women reading, conversing as unconcernedly as though the perils of the deep had ceased to be. In all this I found an impelling interest; the naive capacity in me for wonder, so long dormant, had been marvellously opened up once more. I no longer {{thought of myself as}} the important man of affairs; and when in the progress of the voyage I was accosted by two or three men I had met and by others who had heard of me it was only to feel amazement at the remoteness I now felt from a world whose realities were stocks and bonds, railroads and corporations and the detested new politics so inimical to the smooth conduct of [...] "business." ...|$|E
6000|$|Our imprisoned Captain announced, in {{smart and}} {{emphatic}} language in his prospectus, {{that the time}} had come at last when it was necessary for the gentlemen of England to band together in defence of their common rights and their glorious order, menaced on all sides by foreign revolutions, by intestine radicalism, by the artful calumnies of mill-owners and cotton-lords, and the stupid hostility of the masses whom they gulled and led. [...] "The ancient monarchy was insulted," [...] the Captain said, [...] "by a ferocious republican rabble. The Church was deserted by envious dissent, and undermined by stealthy infidelity. The good institutions, which had made our country glorious, and the name of English Gentleman the proudest in the world, were left without defence, and exposed to assault and contumely from men to whom no sanctuary was sacred, for they believed in nothing holy; no history venerable, for they were too ignorant to have heard of the past; and no law was binding which they were strong enough to break, when their leaders gave the signal for plunder. It was because the kings of France mistrusted their gentlemen," [...] Mr. Shandon remarked, [...] "that the monarchy of Saint Louis went down: it was because the people of England still believed in their gentlemen, that this country encountered and overcame the greatest enemy a nation ever met: it was because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> by gentlemen, that the Eagles retreated before us from the Donro to the Garonne: it was a gentleman who broke the line at Trafalgar, and swept the plain of Waterloo." ...|$|E

In July 2012, Jack Black, who was to star in the film, revealed in an interview that funding for the project had fallen through, as the studio was unsure about its chances for success after the financial failure of Kaufman's last directorial effort. Although the future of the project is not certain, Kaufman says [...] "It could still happen. It would have to be reinvented, though. We had a whole cast and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> into pre-production. So, I’d have to get people back and who knows if they would be interested anymore.

5000|$|The band {{began in}} 2003 with just Gorbel's vocals and Kamstra's multi-instrumental talents, where they played with an indie record label before being signed onto Doghouse Records.
