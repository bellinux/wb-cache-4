5|$|With just a {{few seconds}} {{remaining}} in the first half, there appeared to be little chance that Nebraska <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to score. But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and returned it to the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E

The most common reason given is that Simpson was a junior, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> the next year. At the time, the Heisman trophy was rarely given to an underclassman.|$|E

25|$|After losing {{head coach}} Joan Plaza, Žalgiris rehired Ilias Zouros {{as head coach}} for the 2014 season. Zalgiris left the VTB United League because {{of the changes in}} the EuroLeague format, which meant that the teams that didn't qualify for the Top 16 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to play in the EuroCup playoffs. Žalgiris signed Justin Dentmon on a one-year deal.|$|E
25|$|On September 18, it was {{reported}} that left fielder Carl Crawford would miss the rest of the regular season due to a finger injury suffered in the previous month. Joe Maddon stated that the concern was over Crawford's inability to swing a bat, and that if he were to be used at all before being completely healed, it would be for defense and baserunning. Crawford said that if the Rays were to make the ALCS or the World Series, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to come back.|$|E
25|$|Derby got the Prime Minister {{to agree}} that Robertson should {{accompany}} Wilson (British Military Representative) to all Supreme War Council meetings and he would make no proposals until Robertson and the War Council had {{had a chance to}} vet them. He then reneged on this promise, telling Derby (26 November) that Robertson <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to comment at the meeting itself and that decisions would have to ratified by the War Cabinet after they had been made. Lloyd George restored Wilson's freedom of action by instructing Wilson to send his reports directly to him.|$|E

25|$|With {{yet another}} new head coach (Jimmy Gardner), the Hamilton Tigers roared {{off to an}} {{impressive}} 10–4–1 start in the 1924–25 NHL season. Only halfway through the season, they had more wins than any other season in their NHL history. The team slumped somewhat {{in the second half}} of the season but still managed to finish first overall with a record of 19 wins, 10 losses, and 1 tie, just ahead of the Toronto St. Patricks. It looked like the franchise <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> at winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since winning it as the Bulldogs over a decade prior in 1913.|$|E
25|$|It {{was agreed}} that {{counties}} {{with a large}} unionist population, concentrated in a relatively small area in eastern Ulster, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to opt out of}} the Free State and remain under the Crown. An Irish Boundary Commission was to be established to draw a border (which ultimately came to encompass a six-county region.) Inclusion in the Free State was to be subject to a vote of the majority population in each county. Collins anticipated no more than four counties would join the northeastern statelet, making it economically nonviable, and that this would facilitate the reunification of all 32 counties in the foreseeable future.|$|E
500|$|After 27 {{months of}} {{serving in the}} army, Middleton got his first promotion, to corporal. [...] Promotions came very slowly, and {{occurred}} only when a position was vacated by someone else getting promoted or retiring. Shortly after his promotion on 10 June 1912, Corporal Middleton was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to compete for an army commission. Here Middleton attended an intensive training course {{to prepare for the}} written examination required for a second lieutenant's commission. [...] Of the 300 civilians and enlisted men who took the exam, 56 of them passed and were commissioned. Middleton's score was just about {{in the middle of the}} passing scores. Almost all of those passing were college graduates, coming from schools such as Harvard, Yale, Virginia Military Institute, and Stanford. Four of the 56, including Middleton, would go on to become general officers.|$|E

Portland had good weather {{in the days following}} its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see all three symbols. The sculpture maintained good health until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly. In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week.|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north...

On January 12, 1999, music video was the first video that {{is considered to be}} [...] "retired" [...] from MTV's daily top ten countdown, Total Request Live. MTV's Total Request Live said the song was the most requested music video [...] "for too long so they had to stop airing it so other artists <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> at the coveted number one spot." [...] The video, however, never actually reached number one; it peaked at number two. (In fact, for the majority of its run, it was stuck at third behind videos by N'Sync and Britney Spears; at the time, Daly jokingly called the #3 position on the countdown [...] "The Korn Spot".) [...] Deuce, the video album where [...] "Got the Life"'s music video appears on, was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. California rapper WC makes a cameo appearance in the video dancing. Eminem, Jay Gordon of Orgy, Fred Durst, Sam Rivers, and Wes Borland of Limp bizkit {{can be seen in the}} end of the video.|$|E

The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: [...] "I cannot but express my deep disappointment—no doubt shared by many people here—in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony.

2500|$|From {{the time}} he was 5–14, Ljungberg was coached by Eriksson. Eriksson’s {{impression}} of the youngster was that he was remarkably talented for his age and that he was considerate of other players, noting that Ljungberg would pass the ball to his friends, so that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to score. [...] Ljungberg credits Eriksson for having a profound effect on his career as well as Brazilian football player, Sócrates. Also in his youth, he enjoyed playing ice hockey and developed a talent for handball; he was eventually called up to the under-15 national handball team, but decided to focus his attentions on football.|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, one of {{the reasons}} why Davis said he did not want to skate the pursuit event was so that the two skaters who had not earned spots in any {{individual}} event and had been brought to Turin specifically to skate the team pursuit <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to compete—a chance that Davis was denied during the 2002 Games. [...] "It was a difficult decision for me," [...] Davis said. [...] "Athletes came here just for [...] pursuit. I came here just for the 1000 meters, the 1500 meters, the 5000 meters." [...] In an email sent by U.S Speedskating Executive Director on February 3, 2005, USS terminated Davis' athlete agreement effective February 4, 2005, discontinuing Davis' USS benefits and terminating USS rights to the use of Davis' name and image.
