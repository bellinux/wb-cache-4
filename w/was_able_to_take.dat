OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres.

Klöden next took second overall in the Tour de Suisse, later in June. The following month, Leipheiemer and Horner raced as Astana (though {{they were the only}} Astana riders in the event) at the Cascade Cycling Classic, and Leipheimer <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the overall win there, largely thanks to a convincing victory in the third stage time trial.

After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.|$|E
