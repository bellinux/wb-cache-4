5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out.

I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E

Like Faber, Bril was a long-term resident in Rome who had converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism, as Elsheimer did later.|$|E
25|$|By May 1863 Bahá'u'lláh was exiled next to Constantinople, {{the capital}} of the Ottoman Empire, and his family went <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Now</b> aged seventeen, after {{arriving}} in Constantinople, Bahíyyih Khánum renounced the idea of marriage. This was very strange for a woman of her rank and era, however it was a request which Bahá’u’lláh gladly accepted. After a short while in Constantinople the family was again exiled to Adrianople. Bahíyyih Khánum describes how she was a strong young woman until the journey to Adrianople. Adrianople proved a very unhappy period for the young Bahíyyih Khánum.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} fallen angel is the archdevil Iblis (Arabic: إِبْلِيس) or Azazil (Arabic: عزازيل Azāzīl). Alternatively, he {{is considered}} to be a jinni who was either once ascended to heaven, but later banished from there or counts as the father of the jinn. As a fallen angel, the jinn existed already before the fall of Iblis and the Jinn, like humans, do not ascend to Heaven before death. Iblis is assumed to be different from the Jinn. While the Jinn are made out of smokeless fire, he is believed to be composed of another kind of fire (according to Ibn Abbas from the fire of samum). Unlike the Christian belief, Iblis is not generally in charge of non-angelic spirits, but over the satanic Jinn (demons). In parts of folklore, some other angels were convinced by Iblis to distrust the creation of human and have fallen <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> <b>now</b> roaming as demons on earth or in hell.|$|E
25|$|Rufus orders Dana to {{convince}} Alice to sleep <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>now</b> {{that she has}} recovered. Dana speaks with Alice, outlining Alice's three options: she can refuse and be whipped and raped; she can acquiesce and be raped without being beaten; or she can try run away again. Injured and terrified from her previous attempt to run away, Alice gives in to Rufus's desire and becomes his concubine. While in his bedroom, Alice finds out that Rufus did not send Dana's letters to Kevin, and tells Dana. Furious that Rufus lied to her, Dana runs away to find Kevin, but is betrayed by a jealous slave, Liza. Rufus and Weylin capture her and Weylin whips her brutually. Still, when Weylin finds out that Rufus has failed to keep his promise to Dana to send her letters, he writes to Kevin and tells him that Dana {{is back on the}} plantation. Kevin comes to retrieve Dana, but Rufus stops them on the road and threatens to shoot them. He tells Dana that she can't leave him again. The dizziness overcomes Dana and she travels back to 1976, this time with Kevin.|$|E

2500|$|What {{follows is}} a series of musical numbers {{performed}} by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in counterpoint of their hopes for the future ("You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through"). Buddy then appears, dressed in [...] "plaid baggy pants, garish jacket and a shiny derby hat", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him. ("The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past- and her obsession <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>now</b> ("Losing My Mind"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them ("The Story of Lucy and Jessie"). [...] Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy ("Live, Laugh, Love"), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.|$|E

Realizing this, Alan sets his sights on moving out to accomplish things on his own, with Charlie seemingly supporting the idea, but has since chosen to stay as he favors his son's company. Recently, Charlie is bothered by his father trying to impose his will on him with maintaining the house, as he is a full tenured professor at one of the most prestigious institutions in the country working on [...] "life-altering" [...] mathematics, i.e., in solving crimes. Alan just wants him to be responsible and not end up like Larry, though Mr. Eppes respects Fleinhardt. Even he has thought of this possibility and decides to do more around the home. After Charlie compares his own situation to that of Einstein his father looks into information on the physicist and understands his son's predicament. Charlie also feels guilty about the amount of time his parents, particularly his mother, who always was attuned to his way of thinking, spent with him as a child; he even asks his mother (JoBeth Williams) in a dream if she regrets the time away from Don and Alan because of the special attention he needed growing up.|$|E
