Nonetheless—with many caveats we have expressed—even this fashionable expression may be of some usefulness.|$|R

All we did was say, 'Hey, there's a diversity of opinion among people [...] and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about freedom of conscience.' I don't see myself as defiant." [...] In January 1985, Monsignor John P. Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised [...] "because of [...] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times {{to say that the}} Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned.|$|E
500|$|Don't Look Now {{has been}} much admired by and an {{influence}} on subsequent filmmakers. [...] Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated {{that it is a}} film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on <b>We</b> <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|E

Always seems to win every battle – apart from a Christmas short – against Weebl, who states [...] "damn you wee bull. you win this time." [...] Popular with the ladies. Possibly descended from Wee Mammoth, he always talks by snorting. No words are formed, but everyone seems to understand him, much like Weebl's and Bob's slurred speech. He still loves Weebl however, and wants to talk, according to the subject line of an E-Mail he sends in the recent episode 'Email' ("Son, <b>We</b> <b>Need</b> <b>To</b> <b>Talk.</b> Love Wee Bull").|$|E

40|$|Tim Dunlop, {{author of}} The New Front Page: New Media and the Rise of the Audience, argues <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>talking</b> about new media versus old media and instead look at ways {{for them to}} work {{together}} in service of the citizens they purport to serve. As far as the media is concerned: this is the best of times, this is the worst times. The worst, because no one has figured out how to make the important journalism on which a democracy relies pay for – and thus sustain – itself. The best, because the new technologies have unleashed an unprecedented level of information that makes it possible for people to be better informed than ever...|$|R
40|$|The Merriam-Webster {{dictionary}} defines {{disease as}} "a condition that prevents the body or mind from working normally" and addiction as a "compulsive need for {{and use of}} a habit-forming substance" (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary 2016). In contrast, depression is "a seriosu medical condition {{in which a person}} feels very sad, hopeless, and unimportant and often is unable to live in a normal way. " The dictionary makes it clear that depression is a disease. Concerning addiction, it's a bit ambiguous, even though drug abuse prevents the "body or mind from working normally. " <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>talking</b> about drug abuse as simply a bad habit, and instead start discussing how to treat and prevent addiction as an illness...|$|R
2500|$|An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier {{answers the}} {{question}} [...] "What is Riot grrrl?" [...] with: [...] " [...] Because we girls {{want to create}} mediums that speak to US. [...] We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to each other. Communication and inclusion are key. [...] We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms.

2500|$|Wilford's right hand, {{the second}} in command on the train and has been the {{spokesperson}} for Wilford for the past 17 years. About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when <b>We</b> <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously there was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E

5000|$|I think referendums are awful. The {{late and}} great Julian Critchley {{used to say}} that, not very surprisingly, they were the {{favourite}} form of plebiscitary democracy of Mussolini and Hitler. They undermine Westminster. What they ensure, {{as we saw in}} the last election, is {{that if you have a}} referendum on an issue, politicians during an election campaign say: [...] "Oh, we're not going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about that, <b>we</b> don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about that, that's all for the referendum." [...] So during the last election campaign, the euro was hardly debated. I think referendums are fundamentally anti-democratic in our system, and I wouldn't have anything to do with them. On the whole, governments only concede them when governments are weak.|$|R

In the Film, she discusses the practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and other issues she claims are blighting Somalia. On her return to London, she began campaigning with Save the Children, to highlight such issues and said [...] "I go into schools with {{a high number of}} Somali girls, and they always seem shocked that it is part of our history and culture. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> women <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their experiences, men <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their marital experiences, clerics to explain it is not linked to religion and doctors <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the problems it causes.

5000|$|In 2016, Berrin's cover story, {{describing}} being {{harassed by}} Ari Shavit, {{led to his}} temporarily suspension from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Shavit, who viewed the incident as merely flirting, apologized to Berrin, saying [...] "I apologize {{from the bottom of}} my heart for this misunderstanding. I did not mean to say anything unwelcome to Berrin." [...] In response, Shelly Yachimovich wrote: [...] "I don't know if Berrin accepted his apology, but I didn't... It's not like he accidentally stepped on somebody's toe." [...] Berrin also saw Shavit's apology as 'absurd' and Shavit will take time off journalism. Berrin said about the purpose of her article: [...] "It happens every day to women around the world, and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> about that, not about this one person in Israel." ...|$|R

50|$|Blogger and {{cultural}} critic Mikki Kendall {{has written about}} the lack of support for the alleged victims in this case in the past. An article in Cosmopolitan noted that the media consistently ignores the violence perpetuated against black women and girls as compared to the coverage given to white women and girls. The article concluded:Mainstream media failed these women. The lack of coverage thwarted a national conversation about sexual violence as a distinct form of police brutality. The stories of these women <b>need</b> <b>to</b> serve as an important intervention in conversations about anti-black state violence, rape culture, and the vulnerability of sex workers, ex-offenders, and current and recovering drug addicts to state and state-sanctioned violence. This verdict and Holtzclaw's forthcoming sentencing are entry points for a more thoughtful, humane, and transformative national dialogue about police brutality and sexual violence. With or without mainstream media coverage, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>talking</b> about this trial and everything it represents.|$|R
