5|$|Anticipating {{the rural}} {{background}} of most men, the initial camps provided soil conservation and farming-related projects. By August 1945, 550 men worked on dairy farms and <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> testing. Labor-intensive farming operations like dairies were short {{of workers and}} accepted COs to help fill the gap. Men assigned to the Bureau of Reclamation built contours to prevent soil erosion, constructed 164 reservoirs and 249 dams. A sixth of all CPS work was performed in this area.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, most glacial {{acetic acid}} was {{obtained}} from the pyroligneous liquor, a product of the distillation of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of {{glacial acetic acid}}, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
5|$|Jersey milk {{being very}} rich, cream and butter {{have played a}} large part in insular cooking. (See Channel Island milk) However, there is no {{indigenous}} tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey fudge, mostly imported and made <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited <b>with</b> <b>Milk</b> director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him {{to turn it into}} something more. Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|In {{a corner}} of our 60m3 room {{farthest}} away from the apparatus, we exploded 3mg. of sodium chlorate <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E
5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> or almond milk (for a kosher version) and cornstarch. It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

5|$|Palestinian desserts include baklawa, halawa and kanafeh, as well {{as other}} {{semolina}} and wheat pastries. Baklawa is a pastry made of thin sheets of unleavened flour dough (phyllo), filled with pistachios and walnuts sweetened by honey. Burma Til-Kadayif, or simply Burma, especially popular in East Jerusalem, has the same filling as baklawa, but is cylndrical in shape and made with kanafeh dough instead of phyllo. Halawa is a block confection of sweetened sesame flour served in sliced pieces. Muhalabiyeh is a rice pudding made <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> and topped with pistachios or almonds.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering the Castro District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men tried to open an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, <b>with</b> <b>Milk</b> as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E

5|$|The farm {{combined}} {{a practical}} American business model {{with the concept}} of a European country seat or manor, with cows being milked constantly, and <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> promptly chilled and bottled within five minutes, and shipped to stores in New York City each night. The farm was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. The farm also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who {{began his career as a}} charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates <b>with</b> <b>Milk</b> who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Jackie Chan was the stunt {{director}} of Rob-B-Hood, having choreographed all the stunts with the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. He continued his tradition of performing his own stunts in the film, for example, jumping between several air-conditioners {{on the outer}} wall of a tall building to reach the ground. Several scenes required Chan to co-ordinate his stunts with the baby, including a car chase around the Sha Tin industrial area, in which he managed to snatch the baby away seconds before a car crashed into him; and a scene in Ocean Park in which he climbed {{on the underside of}} a roller coaster with the baby in hand. Chan suffered minor injuries attempting stunts in the film, having been kicked in the chest by a stuntman wearing the wrong boots and fallen off a quad bike, while attempting to perform a wheelie. Chan's combat choreography included the use of improvised weapons in combat; when he fought a pair of skilled henchmen in a deep freeze room, he defeated them by spraying them <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> and then using a large fan to blast them with cold air.|$|E

5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship <b>with</b> <b>Milk</b> in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
5|$|Supporters among Ravalomanana's {{high-level}} Tiko staff {{established a}} group to promote his campaign, which he named Tiako Iarivo ("I Love Antananarivo"). The candidate spent over 700 million Malagasy francs on the campaign, drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations. His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate's face, name and slogan, and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of milk to the public. Ravalomanana's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who, through intelligence, determination and responsible management, succeeded in developing a thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city. The Ravalomanana campaign received support {{on the basis of}} his evident success as a manager, his leadership in the Christian community and his non-alignment with Ratsiraka's AREMA party, as well as his relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters. The campaign opened on 2 November 1999, and by 8 November Ravalomanana held a led in the polls. In the 14 November municipal elections, Ravalomanana was elected mayor of Antananarivo with 45 per cent of the votes.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame de S√©vign√©. Many teas are traditionally drunk <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> in cultures where dairy products are consumed. These include Indian masala chai and British tea blends. These teas {{tend to be}} very hearty varieties of black tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, or the East Friesian blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce acidity. The Han Chinese do not usually drink milk with tea but the Manchus do, and the elite of the Qing Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. Hong Kong-style milk tea is based on British colonial habits. Tibetans and other Himalayan peoples traditionally drink tea <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> or yak butter and salt. In Eastern European countries (Russia, Poland and Hungary) and in Italy, tea is commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, tea <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> is called a bawarka ("Bavarian style"), and is often drunk by pregnant and nursing women. In Australia, tea <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> is white tea.|$|E

50|$|Two {{conflicting}} tendencies {{caused the}} current rarity of purebred, high-performance animals. The Pinzgauer is mainly bred as a beef suckler cow, {{so there is}} no selection on milk performance. However, there are utility crossings with local or distinct beef breeds, too. In Austria itself, since 1969, Red Holstein have been crossed into Pinzgauer to increase the milk performance. The aim is to achieve 6,000 kg <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> 4% <b>milk</b> fat content and 3.5% protein. The average milk performance in Austria is 5,356 kg <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> 3.89% <b>milk</b> fat and 3.28% protein (2005).|$|R
