5|$|The Municipal Act, 2001 is the {{legislation}} that enables incorporation and stipulates governance of Ontario's municipalities, excluding the City of Toronto, which {{is subject to the}} City of Toronto Act, 2006. The Municipal Act, 2001 provides lower and single-tier municipalities <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to incorporate as cities, towns, villages, townships, or generically as municipalities. There are no minimum population thresholds or other requirements for these municipal sub-types. A municipality can change its status to any of these so long as its resulting name is not being used by another municipality. For upper-tier municipalities, the act provides them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to incorporate as counties, regions and district municipalities.|$|E
5|$|After WrestleMania 32, <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Authority</b> now disbanded, Triple H {{competed in}} the WWE Live tour of the United Kingdom in late April before taking a hiatus from WWE television, whilst {{occasionally}} appearing at NXT and Cruiserweight Classic events. He was present for the finales of the Cruiserweight Classic and the United Kingdom Championship Tournament, awarding the titles to T.J. Perkins and Tyler Bate, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to commute sentences.|$|E

5|$|After Rollins {{suffered}} a legitimate severe knee injury at a live event, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was vacated {{and it was}} announced {{that there would be a}} tournament to determine a new champion at Survivor Series. On the November 9 episode of Raw, Triple H offered to give Reigns a bye to the finals of the tournament if he joined The Authority, but Reigns refused. At Survivor Series, Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose in the tournament finals to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H came out and attempted to congratulate Reigns, but was instead hit with a spear. This allowed Sheamus to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and quickly defeat Reigns to win the championship, resulting in Sheamus aligning <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|At , WWE Champion Randy Orton {{defeated}} World Heavyweight Champion John Cena {{to unify}} the two titles into the new WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In January 2014, Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010, and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Batista's win and Daniel Bryan's lack {{of participation in the}} Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live crowd at the event. At Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista (who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio) for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Daniel Bryan also participated in the Elimination Chamber match, but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane, who was affiliated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E

5|$|On the July 21 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H {{announced}} that Lesnar would face John Cena at SummerSlam for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam on August 17, Lesnar defeated Cena {{to become the}} WWE World Heavyweight Champion and during the match he delivered sixteen suplexes (most of which were German suplexes) and two F-5s to Cena, who barely managed any offense. On the August 19 episode of Main Event, Triple H announced that Cena was invoking his championship rematch clause against Lesnar at Night of Champions on September 21, where Lesnar was disqualified due to Seth Rollins interfering, but retained his championship, {{which could not be}} lost via disqualification. Later in the year, after Rollins reunited <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Authority,</b> he was added to Lesnar and Cena's championship match at the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2015, making it a triple threat match, which Lesnar won despite suffering a storyline broken rib during the match.|$|E
5|$|On the October 27 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H would offer John Cena {{a chance to}} join forces <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Authority,</b> which Cena refused. This led to Triple H announcing a five-on-five tag team {{elimination}} match for Survivor Series, with a team representing The Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced that if Team Authority would lose, they would be removed from power. On the November 21 episode of SmackDown, Triple H announced that if Team Cena lost, all of Team Cena, except Cena himself, would be fired. At Survivor Series, Big Show joined The Authority by betraying Cena, but Sting made his WWE debut, attacking crooked referee Scott Armstrong and Triple H, and assisted Dolph Ziggler in pinning Rollins to give Team Cena the victory, putting the Authority out of power.|$|E
5|$|The patent issue {{soon became}} a {{struggle}} between Prime Minister Robert Walpole (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> of the British Parliament) {{and the leaders of}} Ireland. All attempts by the Irish Privy Council and the Church of Ireland to prevent the release of the coinage proved fruitless. It was soon thought by many that William Conolly’s Commissioners of the Revenue might pay the soldiers stationed in Ireland with the new coin; if the soldiers were paid with the coin, then the merchants of Ireland would be forced to accept the coin from the soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business. This worried the leadership of Ireland and they requested help in challenging Wood's patent and leading a boycott of the coin. Swift was asked by Archbishop King and Lord Chancellor Midleton to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against Wood's coin.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck {{to meet with}} Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, {{in part due to}} Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.|$|E
5|$|The White Horse Turnpike Company was {{incorporated}} January 27, 1854 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to convert White Horse Road into a turnpike, running from Camden to Stratford {{and eventually to}} Atlantic City. By 1913, maintenance of the White Horse Pike became public. The route of US30 today in New Jersey was designated as pre-1927 Route3 from 1916 to 1927 between Camden and Absecon. On October 30, 1925, plans were made for a cross-country route from Salt Lake City, Utah to Atlantic City, New Jersey {{as part of the}} U.S. Highway System. This road was designated U.S. Route30 in 1926. It entered New Jersey from Pennsylvania in Camden and followed the entire length of pre-1927 Route3 to Absecon before continuing into Atlantic City. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route43 replaced the Route3 designation along US30 between US130 and US9 (now Route157) in Absecon while Route25 was designated along with US30 between the Ben Franklin Bridge and US130. In 1938, the portion of US30 from the terminus of Route43 in Absecon into Atlantic City was designated as Route56. Prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, spur routes of Route43 and Route56 were planned. RouteS43 was planned in 1938 to be a route running from Route43 in Germania to Route4 in Northfield; this was never built as a state highway but the alignment is now followed by CR563. RouteS56 was legislated in 1945 to be a spur of Route56 to Brigantine along what had also been legislated as Route S4A; this road became Route87 in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{which was}} to become the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) was founded in 1979. It was known initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association, and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU). It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan president Milton Obote. Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, Idi Amin, including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame had joined Yoweri Museveni's rebel Front for National Salvation (FRONASA). FRONASA fought alongside Obote to defeat Amin in 1979, but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the 1980 general election. Museveni, along with Rwigyema and Kagame, formed a new rebel army, the National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in {{what became known as}} the Ugandan Bush War. President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency, and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to Nairobi, Kenya. In 1982 Ankole youths attacked the Rwandans, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> of Obote, causing many more to join Museveni's NRA.|$|E

On the February 15 Raw, Ziggler {{was involved in a}} fatal five-way match for the Intercontinental Championship, where Owens regained the title after pinning Tyler Breeze. At Fastlane, Ziggler challenged Owens to a match for the Intercontinental Championship, which he lost. In the following weeks, Ziggler began to re-ignite his feud <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Authority,</b> and on the March 14 episode of Raw, he confronted Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. This resulted in Ziggler being granted a match against Triple H where if he won, he could pick his match at WrestleMania (excluding the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match); however, Ziggler lost. At WrestleMania 32, Ziggler competed against Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, The Miz, Stardust, Sin Cara and Zack Ryder in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, which was won by Ryder.|$|E
