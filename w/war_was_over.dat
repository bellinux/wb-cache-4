They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} war {{approached}} and hostilities with the Sioux Indians loomed, Raynolds's knowledge of and experiences in the Great Lakes region became {{more important to the}} army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry.

Before the <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to brigadier general for meritorious service.|$|E

5|$|The Marietta-class {{monitors}} were {{a pair of}} ironclad river monitors {{laid down}} {{in the summer of}} 1862 for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. Construction was slow, partially for lack of labor, and the ships were not completed until December 1865, after the <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> However the navy did not accept them until 1866 and immediately laid them up. They were sold in 1873 without ever having been commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Although {{instrumental}} in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally {{did not want}} to swear allegiance to the British government, and he chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States. Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now that the <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> the tour failed, forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands. Here his health failed him again, leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society).|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{returned}} to the United Kingdom via Sweden, after episodes of unruly behaviour in Oslo. In the United Kingdom he had a personal audience with King Haakon VII of Norway.

The King promised {{to take care of}} Andersen once the <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> Andersen then joined the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy and served on a Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) {{for the duration of the}} war.

5|$|By 1351 the Byzantine civil <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> and John VI Kantakouzenos had {{realized}} {{the threat posed}} by the Ottomans to the Balkan Peninsula. He appealed to the rulers of Serbia and Bulgaria for a united effort against the Turks and asked Ivan Alexander for money to construct warships, but his appeals fell on deaf ears as his neighbours distrusted his intentions. A new attempt for cooperation between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire followed in 1355, after John VI Kantakouzenos had been forced to abdicate and John V Palaiologos had been established as supreme emperor. To cement the treaty, Ivan Alexander's daughter Keraca Marija was married off to the future Byzantine Emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos, but the alliance failed to produce concrete results.|$|E
5|$|From late 1919 {{until the}} 1921 Treaty of Riga, Cooper {{was a member}} of a {{volunteer}} American flight squadron, the Kościuszko Squadron, which supported the Polish Army in the Polish-Soviet War. On July 13, 1920, his plane was shot down and he spent nearly nine months in a Soviet prisoner of war camp where the writer Isaac Babel interviewed him. He escaped just before the <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> and made it to Latvia. For his valor he was decorated by Polish commander-in-chief Józef Piłsudski with the highest Polish military decoration, the Virtuti Militari.|$|E
5|$|He {{was more}} {{directly}} involved in the activities of the commissioned raiders, ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce. He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30, 1861. From then until after the <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> the small group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back to}} the Ugandan border.
