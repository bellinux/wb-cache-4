500|$|The diurnal Japanese serow is a browser {{that feeds}} in early morning and late afternoon, {{primarily}} on fleshy or coniferous leaves, plant shoots, and acorns. [...] It feeds on alder, sedge, Japanese <b>witch-hazel</b> (Hamamelis Japonica), and Japanese cedar. [...] It adjusts its diet to what food is locally available, {{and as a}} ruminant, the serow has a four-chambered stomach. [...] Studies indicate that even severe winters have negligible impact on the serow's food intake, suggesting that, given its solitary social structure, it selects its territory to ensure sufficient food supply. [...] Defecation occurs in set locations.|$|E
500|$|Ravines {{within the}} Pine Bush contain mixed forests of pine-northern {{hardwoods}} and Appalachian oak-pine. The pine-hardwood forests {{are dominated by}} species such as white pine and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), mixed with scattered red maple, a shrub layer dominated by <b>witch-hazel</b> (Hamamelis virginiana), and a herbaceous layer composed {{of a variety of}} herbs, mosses, and lichens. The Appalachian oak-pine forest has a tree canopy of one or more oak species, primarily black oak, white oak, and red oak (Quercus velutina, Quercus alba, and Quercus rubra); these are mixed with pitch pine and some white pine, and a shrub layer dominated by heath shrubs, typically blueberries and black huckleberry. Marshes and wetlands occur along the northern boundary of the Pine Bush and along the bottoms of ravines. Roughly [...] of vernal pools have been mapped, these are ground-water fed ponds that are dominated by grasses, sedges, herbs, and low shrubs.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common dowsing rod is a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush. Some dowsers prefer {{branches}} from particular trees, and some prefer the branches to be freshly cut. Hazel twigs in Europe and <b>witch-hazel</b> in the United States are traditionally commonly chosen, as are branches from willow or peach trees. The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. Often the branches are grasped palms down. The dowser then walks slowly over the places where he suspects the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing rod dips, inclines or twitches when a discovery is made. This method is sometimes known as [...] "willow witching".|$|E
5000|$|The Helen S. Layer Rhododendron Garden {{contains}} heaths and vernal <b>witch-hazels</b> in March, {{through to}} the fall heathers and native <b>witch-hazels</b> in October and November, with over 1,200 rhododendron plants and over 100 mountain laurel plants. This garden {{is set in a}} mature oak, beech, and maple forest.|$|R

Polly Hill plant introductions include varieties of Cornus kousa, Ilex, Stewartia, and about forty Rhododendrons.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Witch-hazels</b> (Hamamelis, [...] ) are a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Hamamelidaceae, with four species in North America (H. mexicana, H. ovalis, H. virginiana, and H. vernalis), and one each in Japan (H. japonica) and China (H. mollis). The North American species are occasionally called winterbloom.|$|R

50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{includes a}} grotto (former quarry), millrace, and pond with bald cypress. Its collection includes three Pennsylvania State Champion Trees (a giant dogwood, a needle juniper, and a lacebark elm), {{as well as}} azaleas, dogwoods, magnolias, junipers, lilacs, viburnums, <b>witch-hazels,</b> Japanese maples, boxwoods, and arborvitae. The site also contains cattails, ferns, irises, mosses, rushes, and wildflowers.|$|R
50|$|The Persian ironwood, {{a closely}} related tree {{formerly}} treated as Hamamelis persica, is now given a genus of its own, as Parrotia persica, as it differs in the flowers not having petals. Other closely allied genera are Parrotiopsis, Fothergilla, and Sycopsis (see under Hamamelidaceae). <b>Witch-hazels</b> are not {{closely related to}} the true Corylus hazels, though they have a few superficially similar characteristics which may cause one to believe that they are.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>witch-hazels</b> are {{deciduous}} shrubs or (rarely) {{small trees}} growing to 10 - 25 ft tall, rarely to 40 ft tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, oval, 2 - 6 in long and 1 - 4 in broad, {{with a smooth}} or wavy margin. The genus name, Hamamelis, means [...] "together with fruit", referring to the simultaneous occurrence of flowers with the maturing fruit from the previous year. H. virginiana blooms in September-November while the other species bloom from January-March. Each flower has four slender strap-shaped petals 3/8 - 3/4 in long, pale to dark yellow, orange, or red. The fruit is a two-part capsule 3/8 in long, containing a single 1/4 in glossy black seed {{in each of the}} two parts; the capsule splits explosively at maturity in the autumn about 8 months after flowering, ejecting the seeds with sufficient force to fly for distances of up to 30 ft, thus another alternative name [...] "Snapping Hazel".|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll remember, sir," [...] {{answered}} Lew Flapp meekly, {{and then}} left the office and ran up to his dormitory, to bathe his nose and put <b>witch-hazel</b> on his hurts. Although outwardly humble he was in reality burning with rage.|$|E

60|$|Still weak {{from the}} blow received, Captain Ponsberry sank down once {{more on the}} cabin couch. There was a lump {{as big as a}} walnut {{on the top of his}} head, and he had Jeff bathe it with water and then with <b>witch-hazel,</b> which made it a trifle more comfortable.|$|E
60|$|But Hans {{never got}} his two bags of gold {{away from the}} vault, for {{just as he was}} leaving--bang! came the stone together, and caught him as though he was a mouse in the door; and that was an end of him. That {{happened}} because he left the <b>witch-hazel</b> behind.|$|E
60|$|He was {{discovering}} then, what Christie {{learned when}} her turn came, that fine natures seldom fail {{to draw out}} the finer traits of those who approach them, as the little <b>witch-hazel</b> wand, even in {{the hand of a}} child, detects and points to hidden springs in unsuspected spots. Women often possess this gift, and when used worthily find it as powerful as beauty; for, if less alluring, it is more lasting and more helpful, since it appeals, not to the senses, but the souls of men.|$|E
60|$|There is a {{peculiar}} interest {{belonging to the}} still later flowers, which abide with us the approach of winter. There is something witch-like in {{the appearance of the}} <b>witch-hazel,</b> which blossoms late in October and in November, with its irregular and angular spray and petals like furies' hair, or small ribbon streamers. Its blossoming, too, at this irregular period, when other shrubs have lost their leaves, as well as blossoms, looks like witches' craft. Certainly it blooms in no garden of man's. There is a whole fairy-land on the hillside where it grows.|$|E
60|$|Prut! teach {{a dog to}} eat sausages. Hans {{would see}} that he took the best, trust him for that. So he filled the bags full of gold, and never touched the silver--for, surely, gold is better than {{anything}} else in the world, says Hans to himself. So, when he had filled his two bags with gold, and had shaken the pieces well down, he flung the one over one shoulder, and the other over the other, and then he had {{as much as he could}} carry. As for the staff of <b>witch-hazel,</b> he let it lie where it was, for he only had two hands and they were both full.|$|E

6000|$|Presently {{there came}} along an old, old man, bent almost double {{with the weight}} of the years which he carried upon his shoulders. This was a famous doctor of the black-arts. He had read as many as a hundred books, so that he was more learned than any man in all of the world--even the {{minister}} of the village. He knew, as well as the birds know when the cherries are ripe, that Claus had a stick of <b>witch-hazel,</b> so he came to the market-place, peering here and peering there, just as honest folks do when they are looking for a servant. After a while he came to where Claus was, and then he stopped in front of him. [...] "Do you want to take service, my friend?" [...] said he.|$|E

6000|$|... "The 15th day," [...] writes Gabriel Archer, [...] "we had again {{sight of}} the land, which made ahead, being as we thought an island, by reason of a large sound that {{appeared}} westward {{between it and the}} main, for coming to the west end thereof, we did perceive a large opening, we called it Shoal Hope. Near this cape we came to anchor in fifteen fathoms, where we took great store of cod-fish, for which we altered the name and called it Cape Cod. Here we saw skulls of her-ring, mackerel, and other small fish, in great abundance. This is a low sandy shoal, but without danger; also we came to anchor again in sixteen fathoms, fair by the land in the latitude of forty-two degrees. This Cape is well near a mile broad, and lieth northeast by east. The captain went here ashore, and found the ground to be full of peas, strawberries, whortleberries, etc., as then unripe, the sand also by the shore somewhat deep; the firewood there by us taken in was of cypress, birch, <b>witch-hazel,</b> and beach. A young Indian came here to the captain, armed with his bow and arrows, and had certain plates of copper hanging at his ears; he showed a willingness to help us in our occasions." ...|$|E
60|$|When Pearson and {{his wife}} had thus {{acquired}} all the rights over Ilbrahim that could be delegated, their affection for him became, like the memory of their native land or their mild sorrow for the dead, a piece of the immovable furniture of their hearts. The boy, also, after a week or two of mental disquiet, began to gratify his protectors by many inadvertent proofs that he considered them as parents and their house as home. Before the winter snows were melted the persecuted infant, the little wanderer from a remote and heathen country, seemed native in the New England cottage and inseparable from the warmth and security of its hearth. Under the influence of kind treatment, and in the consciousness that he was loved, Ilbrahim's demeanor lost a premature manliness which had resulted from his earlier situation; he became more childlike and his natural character displayed itself with freedom. It was in many respects a beautiful one, yet the disordered imaginations of both his father and mother had perhaps propagated a certain unhealthiness {{in the mind of the}} boy. In his general state Ilbrahim would derive enjoyment from the most trifling events and from every object about him; he seemed to discover rich treasures of happiness by a faculty analogous to that of the <b>witch-hazel,</b> which points to hidden gold where all is barren to the eye. His airy gayety, coming to him from a thousand sources, communicated itself to the family, and Ilbrahim was like a domesticated sunbeam, brightening moody countenances and chasing away the gloom from the dark corners of the cottage.|$|E
6000|$|See here, for instance--let us {{stop the}} old chaise, {{and get out}} a minute {{to look at this}} brook--one of our last summer's pets. What is he doing this winter? Let us at least say, [...] "How do you do?" [...] to him. Ah, here he is! and he and Jack Frost {{together}} have been turning the little gap in the old stone wall, through which he leaped down to the road, into a little grotto of Antiparos. Some old rough rails and boards that dropped over it are sheathed in plates of transparent silver. The trunks of the black alders are mailed with crystal; and the <b>witch-hazel,</b> and yellow osiers fringing its sedgy borders, are likewise shining through their glossy covering. Around every stem that rises from the water is a glittering ring of ice. The tags of the alder and the red berries of last summer's wild roses glitter now like a lady's pendant. As for the brook, he is wide awake and joyful; and where the roof of sheet ice breaks away, you can see his yellow-brown waters rattling and gurgling among the stones as briskly as they did last July. Down he springs! over the glossy-coated stone wall, throwing new sparkles into the fairy grotto around him; and widening daily from melting snows, and such other godsends, he goes chattering off under yonder mossy stone bridge, and we lose sight of him. It might be fancy, but it seemed that our watery friend tipped us a cheery wink as he passed, saying, [...] "Fine weather, sir and madam; nice times these; and in April you'll find us all right; the flowers are making up their finery for the next season; there's to be a splendid display in a month or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{we cannot}} {{get rid of}} our wonder--we who have brought down the wild lightning, from writing fiery doom upon the walls of heaven, to be our errand-boy and penny-postman. Wonder is crude imagination; and it is {{necessary}} to us, for man shall not live by bread alone, and exact knowledge is not enough. Do we get nearer the truth or farther from it that we have got a gas or an imponderable fluid instead of a spirit? We go on exorcising one thing after another, but what boots it? The evasive genius flits into something else, and defies us. The powers of the outer and inner world form hand in hand a magnetic circle for whose connection man is necessary. It is the imagination that takes his hand and clasps it with that other stretched to him in the dark, and for which he was vainly groping. It is that which renews the mystery in nature, makes it wonderful and beautiful again, and out of the gases of the man of science remakes the old spirit. But we seem to have created too many wonders to be capable of wondering any longer; as Coleridge said, when asked if he believed in ghosts, that he had seen too many of them. But nature all the more imperatively demands it, and science can at best but scotch it, not kill it. In this day of newspapers and electric telegraphs, in which common sense and ridicule can magnetize a whole continent between dinner and tea, we say that such a phenomenon as Mahomet were impossible, and behold Joe Smith and the State of Deseret! Turning over the yellow leaves of the same copy of [...] "Webster on Witchcraft" [...] which Cotton Mather studied, I thought, [...] "Well, that goblin is laid at last!"--and while I mused the tables were turning, and the chairs beating the devil's tattoo all over Christendom. I have a neighbor who dug down through tough strata of clay to a spring pointed out by a <b>witch-hazel</b> rod {{in the hands of a}} seventh son's seventh son, and the water is the sweeter to him for the wonder that is mixed with it. After all, it seems that our scientific gas, be it never so brilliant, is not equal to the dingy old Aladdin's lamp.|$|E
