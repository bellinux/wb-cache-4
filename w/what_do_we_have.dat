5000|$|Innovation exists! You {{just have}} to accept that today you can't {{innovate}} on your own. Real, significant, innovation occurs mostly when several people simultaneously have the same idea and mysteriously move in the same direction, following subliminally emitted and received signals. The contemporary cultural inclination to see innovation as an inherently collaborative effort, a communal, discursive growing and groping towards the new, as consensual and shared, appears to find confirmation throughout history, going back to the Renaissance, looking at Picasso and Braque, the Surrrealists, and the radical architecture groups of the 1960's and the early 70's such as Superstudio and Archigram. So we seek the experiment of working with others, including other architects. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to lose?

Keffer endorsed a zero-based budgeting approach to control excessive state spending. Villalba said that he could move past partisanship and work with Democrats {{to increase the number of}} charter schools and expand educational funding.

[...] "You’re presented with this American Dream and all these American possibilities—and then there's the reality of what actually happens with your life." [...] In response to the obvious influences Tom Waits, The Clash, The Supremes and most notably Bruce Springsteen have had on their previous records, he went on to add [...] "This record is really the one where we said, ‘All right, well, we’ve got our influences.

[...] Garver explained: [...] "But {{he went through}} many manifestations and changes of character, during the five years that we shot. At first, he was up and then his second year, {{he was going through}} a divorce and then, the third year, he met somebody else; and he became more anecdotal and told stories that he loved kids, and he was very outspoken about those that he did not like. So, he was a very interesting character and it was Brian and Sebastian Cabot played Mr. French had such a different style of acting and that's another reason I think that Family Affair was so popular and stayed as it did. Both excellent actors, both coming from very different methods and styles of acting with Sebastian was more from the classical style and he would take home his script and he would dutifully look at every single word and have it to perfection, and then Brian would come in and say, 'Oh <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> today? Let me see the scene, uh-huh, uh-huh, let's go!' So he was very improvisational, motion of the moment. And those two different styles really worked out each other, very well." ...|$|E
