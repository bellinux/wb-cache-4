500|$|Beatrice {{left home}} when Mills {{was nine years}} old, which left her, her older brother Shane, and her younger sister, Fiona, {{in the care of}} their father. Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons. The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father". (Their father disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{her views}} on the Shia {{religion}} in Iran, she has said, after the Arabs came, and Iran converted to Islam, [...] "Eventually <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the Shiite sect, which {{was different from the}} Arabs, who are Sunni" [...] noting Persians were still Muslims but [...] "We were Iranian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Souter {{disagreed}} with the majority's reading of Bowen, saying in that case [...] "we already had found the statute valid on its face before <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the taxpayers' as-applied challenge...so the case cannot be read to hold that taxpayers have standing only to claim that congressional action, but not its implementation, violates the Establishment Clause." [...] Therefore after Bowen, the majority opinion's [...] "distinction between a 'congressional mandate' {{on the one hand}} and 'executive discretion' on the other...is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of 'executive discretion,' so there is no line to be drawn between Bowen and the case before us today." ...|$|E
30|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Rosenthal’s inequality.|$|R
30|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the necessity.|$|R
30|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{discontinuous}} circle maps.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Foulata. The {{poor girl}} was {{stabbed in the}} body, and I saw {{that she could not}} live long.|$|E
60|$|We {{were all}} silent when Sarah finished. So far, then, we {{had succeeded in}} our search. What was to be done next? <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> papa.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're only {{gone to the}} fly, miss. It's {{a little}} way up the street, away from the crowd of carridges." [...] And off <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>TO</b> THE RIGHT, and no mistake.|$|E
30|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> prove Theorem 1.2.|$|R
30|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the {{converse}} inclusion.|$|R
50|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{an invalid}} form.|$|R
6000|$|... "He made no sign: {{the fires}} of hell were round him, [...] The pit of hell below. We sat and waited, but never found him; [...] And then <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E
60|$|My mother {{smiled and}} thanked him. <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go. My mother hesitated in her walk; on the {{threshold}} of the room she glanced round at the bed, but she went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl, as <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> leave the old orchard, [...] "I {{want to ask}} a favour of you all. Don't say good-bye to me {{tomorrow}} morning." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the proof}} of Theorem 1.1.|$|R
30|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> new bounds on E_R_H(M).|$|R
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the proof}} of Proposition 3.1.|$|R
6000|$|... "He made no sign: {{the fires}} of hell were round him, [...] The pit of hell below. [...] We sat and waited, but we never found him; [...] And then <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> behold an ungainly {{young man}} in an ill-fitting blue suit. His face was pimply, his eyes a Teutonic blue, his yellow hair rumpled, his {{naturally}} large mouth was made larger by a friendly grin.|$|E
60|$|It was {{twilight}} when <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go, {{and then}} I saw {{that many of}} the warehouses along the wharves were heaps of ruins. My father said this was that the town might be the better defended.|$|E
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the proof}} of Theorem  1.1.|$|R
30|$|Finally, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the proof}} of Theorem 3.1.|$|R
30|$|Next <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the proof}} of Theorem 1.|$|R
60|$|After {{them came}} utan upon utan of red men. The green horde broke to {{surround}} the temple. The red men charged for the interior, and then <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> continue our interrupted battle; but our foes had vanished.|$|E
60|$|Our guide grinned as he {{left the}} hut to execute his mission, and <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> {{converse}} on this new plan, which, the more we thought of it, seemed the more to grow in our estimation as most feasible.|$|E
60|$|We {{ceased to}} gaze. <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> each other, the same thought, the same {{question}} in our eyes. For these plants to grow, {{there must be some}} air, however attenuated, air that we also should be able to breathe.|$|E
30|$|Next, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} the split feasibility problem (SFP).|$|R
30|$|Next, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{studying}} the stochastic permanence of system (2.5).|$|R
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> deduce {{the higher}} order {{estimates}} about the solution.|$|R
60|$|Then, just as <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go, {{something}} happened. The round-eyed Charles ran puffing {{into the}} quadrangle, {{followed by another}} man with a dog, who had been specially set to pick my birds, and carrying in his hand a much-bedraggled cock pheasant without a tail.|$|E
60|$|The Indian {{was struck}} with this reply, which suited the {{character}} of his mind. Thrusting out his hand, he received mine, and shook it cordially, as much as {{to say he was}} satisfied. Having disposed of this episode thus satisfactorily, <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the more interesting subject of our immediate movements.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> {{look in the}} {{direction}} from whence the first report had come, and there we saw, just clearing {{the tops of the}} nearer hills, a great battleship swinging majestically through the air. Her bow gun spoke again even as we looked, and another shell burst among the fleeing Warhoons.|$|E
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the extreme}} points and rotundity of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces.|$|R
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the {{statement}} of the Darbo fixed point theorem.|$|R
30|$|Next, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{showing the}} global {{stability}} of the equilibrium E^*.|$|R
