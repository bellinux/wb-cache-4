40|$|Discourse {{surrounding}} the ‘refugee issue’, particularly within self-declared left-leaning, liberal movements, has often centred on {{the rhetoric of}} welcome. The narrative however has been adopted, reproduced and circulated without critically interrogating the framing by which such welcome is called upon. This article argues, rather than being inclusionary, the idea of welcome within the Australian context is in fact an exclusionary practice. Welcome {{as an extension of}} border imperialism. It explores the inherent paradoxes, assumptions and colonial undercurrents though a public intervention, Unwelcome Mats, commissioned as part of Melbourne Fringe Festival.   Unwelcome Mats was an intervention that saw  a series of <b>welcome</b> <b>mats</b> printed with the word ‘unwelcome’ and placed at buildings where the act of welcoming is and has been a point of contention, including the Immigration Museum, Old Parliament house and the Department of Citizenship and Border Protection.  Unwelcome Mats, instead of a one-dimensional welcome, sought to instead ask: who has the imperial, historical power to welcome...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat</b> was a four-piece Australian indie {{rock group}} which formed in Sydney in 1989, and broke up in January, 1997. Throughout the early-to-mid-1990s, their songs [...] "Last of the Great Letdowns", [...] "Cake", [...] "Landspeed", [...] "10,000 People", [...] "Hell Hoping", [...] "Play Me" [...] and [...] "Hey! Illusion" [...] topped the Australian {{alternative}} charts, with the videos receiving play on Rage and MTV Australia. The first band ever to play Australia’s Big Day Out festival, The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat</b> toured extensively around Australia {{with the likes}} of the Hoodoo Gurus, Died Pretty, Buffalo Tom, The Lemonheads, The Wonder Stuff, You Am I, Smudge and Bob Dylan.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{combined}} credentials of vocalist Oliver Hartmann and guitarist Olaf Lenk on their résumés, At Vance easily obtained {{a deal with}} Shark Records. Rainald König (guitar), Uli Müller (keyboards), Jochen Schnur (bass), and Spoony (drums) rounded out the lineup that recorded 1999's debut No Escape. European fans lapped it up, and the group's second release, 2000's Heart of Steel (featuring new drummer Jurgen Lucas) was a surprise hit in Japan and encouraged At Vance to quickly issue a followup in 2001's Dragonchaser. Barely pausing for breath, the next year saw the band switching to AFM Records, losing their bassist and keyboard player, releasing their fourth album Only Human, and then hitting the road across Europe with Rhapsody and Angel Dust. A number of personnel changes ensued in 2003, as At Vance <b>welcomed</b> new vocalist <b>Mats</b> Levén and bassist Sascha Feldmann before recording their next LP The Evil in You. A tour with Kamelot followed the release.|$|R

50|$|Electric Soup a.k.a. Electric Soup: The Singles Collection is {{the first}} {{compilation}} album by Australian rock group Hoodoo Gurus and contained all their Australian singles to date (September 1992). The album peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and was certified triple platinum. For the Electric Soup Tour in November of that year, Hoodoo Gurus were supported by Died Pretty and the <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inspired by the {{unexpected}} commercial {{success of their}} friends The Hummingbirds, Connolly and Messenger approached local promoter Steve Pavlovic, who booked the band's live debut, a mid-week gig at the Landsdowne Hotel in inner-city Chippendale in January 1990. The name The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat</b> was chosen {{at the last minute}} by Connolly, in the belief that it was reminiscent of the name of another musical influence, The Wedding Present.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} events of The Reptile Room, Mr. Poe puts the Baudelaire orphans, Klaus, Sunny and Violet {{under the care of}} Aunt Josephine, who lives in a house atop a hill {{overlooking}} Lake Lachrymose, a lake so large that hurricanes have occurred in that area. Aunt Josephine, despite being a good-hearted elder, lives an unusual lifestyle of having phobias of almost everything from cooking food to her <b>welcome</b> <b>mat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1991 The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat</b> {{released}} {{their second}} single, [...] "Cake", and the E.P. Fairydust (a {{reference to the}} [...] "Troggs Tapes"), which featured [...] "10,000 People". Both [...] "Cake" [...] and [...] "10,000 People" [...] received airplay on the newly-national triple j radio network, boosting the band's audience significantly. Around that time, Moss left the group {{and was replaced by}} ex-Benedicts member Leo Mullens, adding another songwriter to the line-up.|$|E
5000|$|After Lap of Honour and its singles [...] "Hey! Illusion" [...] and [...] "Can't Wait to Remind You" [...] {{failed to}} chart, and {{following}} many months of record company difficulties, management problems and band in-fighting, The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat</b> played their final {{show at the}} Annandale Hotel in Sydney in 1997. Connolly has since played with Knievel, Mullens with 2 Litre Dolby and The Small Knives, and Messenger with Auto Circus Cop.|$|E
5000|$|To {{follow up}} The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat,</b> the Philly duo {{released}} The Vestibule on January 3, 2012. The {{title of the}} mixtape derives from one of Moosh's rap lines from their previous mixtape. Twist explained, [...] "We had this song called [...] "Black Forest Gummy Worms" [...] on Up Before The World and there's a line Moosh says, 'Standing at the door while they be sitting in the vestibule,' so the first project was called The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat.</b> You get to the door. We're about to graduate high school. We're knocking on the door, wiping our feet off. Then we get inside, and now we're standing in the vestibule and we think we're in a stage where we're in between. We want to break out huge so bad, {{but we still have}} to get our mindset right - get everything straight get a little bit more mature - and The Vestibule is kind of like saying, 'We're so close but we're not inside.'" [...] After high school graduation, the two chose to put college to the side and pursue music full-time.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, the Haitian revolutionaries had a global {{perspective}} on fighting slavery. They worked with Simón Bolívar in an effort to fight slavery in South America. And they also [...] "rolled out an unconditional <b>welcome</b> <b>mat</b> to anyone who escaped European colonialism in Africa or fled bondage from a slave plantation anywhere in the Americas, North, South, or Central." ...|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Sara is {{surprised}} when Michelangelo wipes {{his feet on}} the <b>welcome</b> <b>mat</b> and folds the napkins with his teeth at dinner. The Sedgewicks notice the change in [...] "their dog" [...] too, when he bolts Simmons to the ground {{to get a piece of}} turkey. Then, at night, Beethoven hears Madison whimpering because of a bad dream, and comforts her. At the next obedience class, Michelangelo leaves everyone in astonishment, by finishing the entire new obstacle course, while the sergeant is announcing about the course.|$|E
5000|$|While still {{members of}} Sidewinder, Martin Craft and Melder formed a side project, Fragile, as a studio-only band with Wayne Connolly on guitar and backing vocals (ex-the <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat,</b> Knievel) and Simon Holmes on guitar and lead vocals (ex-the Hummingbirds). That group issued an album, Airbrushed Perfection, on Half a Cow/Mercury in March 1996. McFarlane {{described}} how it [...] "ran {{the gamut of}} sounds from jangly pop ('Dream Come True') to noisy Hüsker Dü-inspired rockers ('She Really Means that Much to Me', 'Resolving Conflict Situations')." ...|$|E
50|$|Pongo is {{the brother}} of Valerie Twistleton. He is known for having an open heart with a large <b>welcome</b> <b>mat,</b> which women {{frequently}} flit in and out of. However, in Uncle Dynamite, he finally got himself engaged to the truly ghastly Hermione Bostock, though exactly how he managed {{to do so is}} still a mystery. Fortunately, {{with the help of his}} Uncle Fred and the knowledge that she regularly wakes up at 6 in the morning, he realised that they were not meant to be and promptly got together with Sally Painter.|$|E
50|$|Bean {{goes to the}} {{launderette}} {{where he}} suffers a series of mishaps. First, he realises the price of washing has increased from £2 to £3, so he is forced to pull out a spare coin from a specially designed envelope in his trousers. A man (Grant Masters) arrives and pushes Bean away into the next washing machine. Bean then proceeds to place his laundry (which consists of some shirts, an inflatable toy, a lampshade, Teddy, a <b>welcome</b> <b>mat,</b> oversized fuzzy dice and a few pairs of underpants, each labelled with a different day of the week) into the washing machine.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1992 {{they entered}} the studio where Bennie and Giarrusso co-produced their second album, Leaves Me Blind with Wayne Connolly (of the <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat).</b> It was a more layered and {{experimental}} work. The album came out first in the UK, in August, through the short-lived 4AD imprint, Guernica. By that stage Polydor had signed the group in Australia, and released Leaves Me Blind locally, in December. Mathieson described how [...] "they were so far ahead of their contemporaries that they passed over the horizon, borne on a rolling sea of sound that would become their signature." ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 7, 2011, {{while still}} in high school, Moosh and Twist {{released}} their first official mixtape Up Before the World. They soon performed this mixtape live in front of Corey Bader, a suffering cancer patient. [...] They released a few music videos on YouTube but the one that took off the fastest was for [...] "City Kids." [...] The video was directed by Rex Arrow, who was widely known for working with Mac Miller. In June 2011, Moosh and Twist were featured in XXL's section The Break. On September 25, 2011, Moosh and Twist released their second mixtape The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat</b> {{was formed}} in Sydney, Australia in 1989 by songwriters Wayne Connolly and Cory Messenger, who had played {{together}} in John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong in the late 1980s. Drummer Peter Bennett and bassist David Moss worked with Connolly at Fairlight digital audio company, {{and were asked to}} help work on songs demoed on a Tascam four-track recorder. The guitar-based songs were heavily influenced by New Zealand's Flying Nun Records label, as well as US Indie rock performers R.E.M., Hüsker Dü, the Replacements, Dinosaur Jr, The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom, and UK bands The Smiths, The Stone Roses and The Wonderstuff.|$|E
50|$|Wayne Connolly is an Australian producer/engineer and musician. Throughout the 1990s, Connolly {{played in}} Sydney band, The <b>Welcome</b> <b>Mat,</b> {{with whom he}} {{released}} a series of critically acclaimed albums and EPs on the Waterfront Records, Regular Records and id/Mercury labels. In 1994, he formed Knievel with Tracy Ellis and Nick Kennedy, {{who went on to}} release five albums and a series of singles on various labels in Australia, the United States and Japan including Murmur (record label), Citadel Records and Albert Music. Knievel achieved high rotation on Triple J, toured locally and abroad, and supported acts such as Luna, Teenage Fanclub, Death Cab for Cutie and The Pernice Brothers.|$|E
5000|$|While {{performing}} in Memphis, Jerry meets Susan's old roommate, Sally Weaver (Kathy Griffin), who {{gives him a}} large package that she wants him to deliver to the soon-to-be-married George and Susan, telling him {{to be careful with}} it. While on the plane, Jerry, because he has to be careful with the package, is forced to put his own bag in the overhead compartment and, in the process, a bottle of barbecue sauce in his bag is broken. Upon his arrival in New York, Jerry reveals to his friends that the bottle was decorated with a picture of a man who looked like Charles Grodin, on whose television show he would be appearing, and that he had planned to present Grodin with the bottle on the show. He also gives George the [...] "delicate" [...] package, which {{turns out to be a}} <b>welcome</b> <b>mat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Back at home, Bev (Megan Park) {{wants to}} win a {{recording}} contract with Guy. Bev, however, is a terrible singer; the more she practices, the worse she sounds. Guy calls Gail, who is shocked to hear that he loves Katie's demo. Gail lies, claiming it was Bev's demo and that Katie stole it. Meanwhile, Victor steals Katie's clothes and towel while she showers, locking {{her out of the}} house naked. Unable to get back inside, Katie trips over a visiting Luke; thinking fast, she covers herself up using the <b>WELCOME</b> <b>mat.</b> Amused by the situation, Luke gives her his jacket. While Bev welcomes Luke, Gail barges into Katie's room and forces her to sing. Then, after shoving Luke out of the house, Gail plans to get Bev a record deal by using Katie's voice. Bev is reluctant, but goes along with this in order to win Luke's affections.|$|E
5000|$|Ashenda or Shadey (Amharic: አሸንድዮ, Tigrinya: ኣሸንዳ, Agaw language: ሻደይ) is {{a festival}} celebrated in August (G.C.) in the Tigray and Amhara regions of Ethiopia, and in {{neighbouring}} Eritrea. Ashenda marks {{the end of}} a two-week-long fast known as Filseta (Ge'ez: ጾመ-ፍልሰታ) when adherents of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church/Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church gather to honour the Virgin Mary. The word [...] "Ashenda" [...] is currently used both in Amharic and Tigrigna languages to denote a vertical sewerage channel that passes water down to the ground from the top of a roof. In the Khimra sect of Agew, Ashenda means the [...] "tall green grass", estimated at around 80-90 cm minimum height that girls wear around their waists during the holiday. In the tradition of this religious festival, blades of grass are strewn on the floors of homes and shops as a kind of <b>welcome</b> <b>mat.</b> The festivity of Ashenda has no common name throughout the country.

5000|$|A doormat or door-mat is a flat, usually rectangular, object placed {{immediately}} {{outside or}} inside {{the entrance to}} a house or other building, to allow people to easily scrub or wipe the soles of their shoes before entering. Doormats are usually made from tough, long-lasting material such as coir, palmyra (palm) fibres and stalks, nylon, rubber, cloth, or aluminium and other metals. A doormat may also be known as a <b>welcome</b> <b>mat,</b> as its location at an entrance constitutes a [...] "welcome" [...] to visitors, and may therefore also bear some word, message or sign of greeting. This in turn has given rise to a subculture of cartoons featuring characters returning home to find (to the reader) a humorous message on the doormat. The lowly purpose for which doormats exist has also led to informal use of the term as a reference to people who behave timidly or passively when exploited by others (see also Caspar Milquetoast).|$|E
50|$|While Pearl {{speaks with}} Muss, {{the king of}} Humongo, on her fears that Harry might steal the Domesday Device, he reassures her that the Device is safe because it is under the utmost security. Unbeknownst to him, {{everything}} he speaks about, Harry and Swifty are discovering the loopholes for each obstacle. The door to the Device's vault is locked by a tempered-steel lock, but the giant mice of Humongo ever so stupidly keep a spare key under the <b>welcome</b> <b>mat,</b> which Harry finds. The Device is also guarded by guard dogs, but Harry and Swifty sneak in after the horn blows, and the dogs clock out. The Device is also guarded by the King's secret service, but the guard on duty falls for Harry's trick, assuming the note written is genuinely written by his mother, Matilda. Originally, Harry wrote the name Mildred, but after the guard points out the name is Matilda, Harry changes the name, and the guard runs off, asking Harry to watch the Domesday Device for him.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Stewie discovers trick-or-treaters (at first {{thinking}} {{they are real}} monsters and shooting at them with an M16), and soon wants to partake in the activity. Deciding to dress as a baby duck, he is subsequently bullied by a gang of three older boys who steal his candy. Searching for Brian, Stewie blames him for causing him to lose his candy and convinces him to steal back the candy from the bullies. Approaching the bullies to get the candy back, Brian is immediately painted pink. Seeking revenge, Stewie half jokingly suggests to Brian that they kill the bullies, though they both agree they can't actually do that. When his plan to threaten them with a bazooka fails (and ends up killing a Godzilla-like monster instead), Stewie goes to [...] "Plan B" [...] and begins crying for his mother. Lois then confronts the lead bully Justin's mother and becomes her bully instead, demanding Stewie's candy back, demanding Justin's candy, and $40. But because {{she does not have}} any money, Lois takes their <b>welcome</b> <b>mat</b> and says she'll be back tomorrow for $80.|$|E
5000|$|Suffern {{became an}} {{important}} and busy station on the main line of the Erie Railroad. New Yorkers, in search of cool, quite retreat to relieve the stress of their urban lifestyles, filled the passenger trains bound in summer for the surrounding rural regions. Relatively isolated prior to the 1860s, Suffern served as a <b>welcome</b> <b>mat</b> for the upstate Erie traveler. Twenty trains a day, loaded with seasonal tourists, stopped at the impressive Victorian depot. Word soon spread among the travelers that [...] "romantic scenery, fascinating beauty and rich land" [...] could {{be found at the}} [...] "pleasant summer resort". Suffern played host to the traveling public, whether accepting the hospitality offered by the resort hotels and boarding houses or just switching trains. The list of guests, visitors and part-time residents who were attracted to Suffern's rural charm included the names of many families from New York's affluent [...] "upper crust". Some came as seasonal vacationers, closing to rent an estate, while others bought property from the abundant amount of undeveloped land. Picturesque rolling hills and vast wooded lands guarded by the Ramapo Mountains provided a rustic setting for the development of elegant country estates.|$|E

Realizing his brothers have been captured, Practical sees {{an excellent chance}} to try out his new invention. The <b>welcome</b> <b>mat</b> then drops in beneath the Wolf's feet, and he falls into a pit below. He is next seen strapped into a chair in Practical's house, helpless against the technology of the resourceful. When interrogated by Practical about the whereabouts of his brothers, the Wolf first claims to have never heard of the two, and the lie detector goes into action; a needle on the machine's indicator points to [...] "lie", two steam whistles blow {{in the manner of a}} wolf-whistle to signify the claim as such and the machine washes the Wolf's mouth out with soap. Then the Wolf claims to have not seen the two pigs, and gets a spanking from the lie detector. Lastly, he tries to fool the machine into thinking he and Practical are [...] "pals" [...] but the lie detector is able to detect this as a lie, and the Wolf ends up getting the works, with his mouth washed out, his butt being spanked, and his knuckles being whacked with rulers.|$|E
