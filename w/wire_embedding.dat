40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) has {{increased}} in popularity and attracted much attention from many fields such as automotive, aviation, aerospace, and even the fashion industry. Since the early 2000 s, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technologies {{have been the most}} popular in the AM world (“Wohlers Talk” Popularity of FDM). These technologies have been mainly used for building parts for prototype and structural type of applications such as a fixture for components or a housing for mechanisms. ^ With {{the current state of the}} FDM technologies, the functionality of the parts that are printed are limited to the applications listed before or simply just as visual aids. Adding more functionality to these structural parts allows the creation of end user parts which cannot be manufactured with traditional means of fabrication. Discussed in this work is the design and development of the thermal <b>wire</b> <b>embedding</b> (TWE) apparatus, describing three generations of the tool, each contains improvements to facilitate both <b>wire</b> <b>embedding</b> and maintenance. ^ The TWE tool is designed to embed wires into the interlayers or surface of a FDM-built part. Adding conductive wires to an FDM-built part provides an electronic functionality to the design and due to the wires acting as a reinforcement, they inherently increase the mechanical properties of the part. The TWE tool is fully automated to drive wire at various speeds with the use of a DC motor and cut wire with the aid of a cutting mechanism. The TWE tool is capable of embedding wire of different gauges as well as different materials. The TWE can place wires a close as 0. 5 mm apart without seeing any shorting between the wires. With the ability to adapt to different motion control systems, the TWE tool can embed 28 AWG copper wires in different orientations with a measured accuracy as close as +/- 29 μm of its intended position. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to incorporate the TWE tool with multiple technologies to create a multi-functional AM printed part. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{inception}} of stereolithography in the 1980 s, interest in 3 D printing has exploded, with desktop 3 D printers now commercially accessible to the general public. In recent years, next-generation multifunctional technologies have been developed, which combine 3 D printing with other technologies such as <b>wire</b> <b>embedding,</b> foil embedding, CNC machining, and robotic component placement, enabling complex parts {{to be made on}} a single multifunctional machine. ^ However, the complexity of these integrated processes exceeds the capabilities of established design tools. To this end, this thesis aims to develop a multi-functional design solution that can automatically generate final control code for next-generation multifunctional machines, where all design specifications are defined from within a single software package. ^ Specifically, we take on the task of automating a Lulzbot desktop 3 D printer, which has been modified to utilize a custom-designed wire-embedding tool as a secondary extruder. While the algorithms presented herein have been tailored to the needs of this custom printer, the modular nature of the solution will facilitate expansion to include other multifunctional printers, including the planned low-cost multi 3 D multifunctional printer, currently under construction at the W. M. Keck Center for 3 D Innovation at The University of Texas at El Paso. ...|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that the embodied energy of transportation {{for a wide range}} of products can have an appreciable percentage of the environmental impact of a product over its life cycle (Zhu and Sarkis 2006; Pearce et al. 2007; Cholette and Venkat 2009; Meisterling et al. 2009; Winnebeck 2011). Life cycle analysis indicates that ultra-distributed manufacturing with 3 -D printers by prosumers (producer/consumers) would be beneficial from an environmental impact viewpoint (Kreiger and Pearce 2013 a, b). This is the case if conventional manufacturing of equivalent products is avoided by printing them. These savings are in part due to reductions in transportation embodied energy (Kreiger and Pearce 2013 a, b). Recent developments in 3 -D printing (an additive manufacturing technique, which intrinsically reduces material waste) have made distributed manufacturing of high-value products for household use both technically and economically viable, enabling individuals to fabricate an exponentially growing list of products to meet their own needs (Pearce et al. 2010; Wittbrodt et al. 2013). Sales figures indicate that personalized or desktop manufacturing with 3 -D printers is a growing trend (Blua 2013; Economist 2012; Make 2013; Wohlers 2013). A wide range of products can now be produced by low-cost 3 -D printers (Pearce et al. 2010; Martens et al. 2011; Wittbrodt et al. 2013), and open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (or RepRaps) enable particularly fast scaling. RepRaps can manufacture over 50 % of their own components (excluding fasteners) creating a low-cost and easily repairable 3 -D printer that can be used for both upgrades and fabricating replacement parts for low costs (Jones et al. 2011). To create the desired part, RepRaps sequentially deposit 100 - to 400 -micron layers of polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and a wide range of other feedstock materials (Baechler et al. 2013; Kreiger et al. 2014; Mireles et al. 2013). Open-source 3 -D printers have already demonstrated usefulness for developing engineering prototypes (Sells et al. 2010), customizing scientific equipment (Pearce 2012; Pearce 2014; Zhang et al. 2013), creating electronic sensors (Leigh et al. 2012; Anzalone et al. 2013), education (Gonzalez-Gomez et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013), co-creative product realization (Redlich et al. 2008), personal manufacturing (Devor et al. 2012), <b>wire</b> <b>embedding</b> (Bayless et al. 2010), modular robotics (Moses et al. 2009), tissue engineering (Miller et al. 2012), and appropriate technology for sustainable development (Pearce et al. 2010). This paper investigates the ability of the RepRap to be used in manufacturing directly following the open-source paradigm and uses a case study of a solar photovoltaic (PV) racking technology.|$|E

40|$|The {{conductance}} {{through a}} semi-infinite one-dimensional <b>wire,</b> partly <b>embedded</b> in a superconducting bulk electrode, is studied. When the electron-electron interactions within the wire are strongly repulsive, the wire effectively decouples from the superconductor. If they are moderately or weakly repulsive, {{the proximity of}} the superconductor induces superconducting order in the segment of the <b>wire</b> <b>embedded</b> in it. In this case it is shown that the conductance exhibits a crossover from conductive to insulating behavior as the temperature is lowered down. The characteristic crossover temperature of this transition has a stretched exponential dependence on the length of the part of the <b>wire</b> <b>embedded</b> in the superconductor. The amount of this stretch is determined {{by the nature of the}} electron interactions within the wire. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{final product}} {{functionality}} of parts produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) can, in part, {{be improved by}} the inclusion of multi-material capabilities. The “Multi 3 D system” that is under development at The University of Texas at El Paso uses material extrusion printing (or fused deposition modeling), solid conductor <b>wire</b> <b>embedding,</b> direct-write, component placement, and micromaching to enable multi-material fabrication. The Multi 3 D was designed to transport a workpiece between manufacturing stations via a six-axis robot, portable build platform (PBP), and a controlled temperature environment or chamber that travels to each manufacturing station. The heated travel envelope (HTE) was included to mitigate thermal shrinkage (and eventually warping) that occurs when a thermoplastic is subjected to a decrease in temperature {{within a short time}} frame. An end-effector was also designed to allow the six-axis robot to interact and handle the PBP and HTE. Discussed in this work is the design and construction of the HTE as well as its performance in terms of maintaining a stable temperature while considering the imposed weight and dimensional constraints. The HTE design includes a compressible high temperature bellow “door” which allows it slide over builds and increases the height of builds (~ 22 cm) which can be produced in the Multi 3 D system. The HTE is capable of maintaining a 150 ± 8 °C environment with its convective heating system, which is the baseline set for building parts with polycarbonate, specifically 145 °C. The temperature change (drop) of parts is reduced by 71 % with the inclusion of HTE in the transportation process. The quantified temperature drop without the HTE during transportation was approximately 21 °C in comparison to 6 °C with the HTE. The construction and performance (e. g., locating accuracy) of the PBP are also discussed. The PBP was designed around the “Platen” build platform to replicate its abilities but in a form that allows it to be portable. The PBP is able to receive vacuum (- 42. 3 ± 8. 5 KPa) supply for restraining sacrificial build sheets in two forms, from the station of the Multi 3 D system it is placed in and from the end-effector. The PBP locates accurately into the FDM system, in a form that maintains the FDM’s achievable accuracy of ± 38 ?m, via the use of three locating pins and its vacuum fitting. The locating accuracy of the PBP was determined by printing “stair step” parts which were analyzed for layer shifting. These results were compared to stair steps printed in an unmodified FDM system as a control. The layer shifting was measured to be + 50. 8 to - 38. 1 ?m for non-paused builds and + 63. 5 to - 50. 8 ?m for paused builds on both machines (modified and control). This gave indication that the modifications done to the FDM machine and the portable build platform had no direct effect on the achievable accuracy in parts with this specific geometry and these processing conditions. Ultimately, the Multi 3 D system will be utilized for Aerospace applications to manufacture components for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites, but other applications where disparate materials are required can be envisioned. This can be accomplished with these components or subsystems which were developed for material handling within the system. ...|$|E

In the event that an attacker gains access to an embedded control network, the attacker might manipulate potentially safety-critical message traffic to induce a system failure.
