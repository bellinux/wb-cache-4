25|$|Further inroads {{came with}} the {{founding}} of a new school for the training of Western style music instructors in 1924, renaming the Istanbul Oriental Music School as the Istanbul Conservatory in 1926, and sending talented young musicians abroad for further music education. These students include well-known Turkish composers such as Cemal Reşit Rey, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Ahmet Adnan Saygun, Necil Kazım Akses and Hasan Ferit Alnar, who {{became known as the}} Turkish Five. The founding of the Ankara State Conservatory with the aid of the German composer and music theorist Paul Hindemith in 1936 showed that Turkey in terms of music <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> the West.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the start}} of her career, Brandy has named Whitney Houston as her most {{prominent}} music and entertainment influence. Early in her career, she would often describe Houston as her “idol”, crediting her voice, music, and performances as critical to her, both personally and professionally. In a 2014 interview, Brandy stated that, “as a professional musician, I would say that Whitney Houston is the greatest voice of all time.” She elaborates, saying “She was always the idea for me. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> her, sing like her, and do everything she was doing.” Beginning the late 90’s, Houston would evolve as a personal friend and mentor to Brandy, with Houston nicknaming herself as Norwood’s “godmother”.|$|E

500|$|According to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC, [...] "It's {{worth noting}} that before Madonna, most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after her, almost all would be female singers... When The Beatles hit America, they changed the {{paradigm}} of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it back—with {{an emphasis on the}} female." [...] Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, asserted that [...] "Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow... She certainly raised the standards of all of them... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers." [...] According to Fouz-Hernández, subsequent female singers such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, the Spice Girls, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, and Pink were like her [...] "daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> her."

In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in Wall Street has changed and he replied, [...] "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, {{in the same way that}} Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay—he's the new Gordon Gekko". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman recently commented that the film, [...] "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".|$|E

500|$|Many of Uematsu's musical {{influences}} {{come from}} the United Kingdom and the United States. He cites Elton John as his biggest musical influence, and he has stated that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> him. Other major inspirations include The Beatles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Simon & Garfunkel, and progressive rock bands. In the classical genre, he cites Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as a great influence. Uematsu has said that 1970s bands, such as Pink Floyd and King Crimson, influenced his Final Fantasy compositions. The intro to the piece [...] "One-Winged Angel" [...] from Final Fantasy VII {{was inspired by the}} Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Purple Haze"; the lyrics were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his cantata Carmina Burana, specifically the songs [...] "Estuans Interius", [...] "O Fortuna", [...] "Veni, Veni, Venias" [...] and [...] "Ave Formosissima". In turn, Nobuo Uematsu has had a major influence on video game music and beyond the video games industry as well. For example, [...] "Liberi Fatali" [...] from Final Fantasy VIII was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women's synchronized swimming event. From the same game, [...] "Eyes on Me", featuring Chinese pop singer Faye Wong, sold a record 400,000 copies and was the first song from a video game to win an award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards, where it won [...] "Song of the Year (International)" [...] in 2000. In a 2010 interview, Uematsu revealed, [...] "Rather than getting inspiration from listening to other music, I get inspiration while I'm walking my dog." ...|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{has been}} {{influenced}} by various genres and artists; Madonna, Queen, the Rolling Stones, Gwen Stefani, Neutral Milk Hotel, the Black Eyed Peas, the Killers, Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Janet Jackson, and Beck have all influenced her music. After experimenting with country, pop rock, and electronic music, Kesha stuck with the latter. Thematically, her music generally revolves around escapism, partying, individuality, supernatural moments, rebellion, and grief. Kesha's musical influences also consist of hip hop, punk rock, crunkcore, glam rock, pop, dance music and classic country. Her country influences of Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash come from her mother's country songwriting, while her older brother exposed her to hip-hop and punk bands, Fugazi, Dinosaur Jr. and the Beastie Boys. [...] She credits her straightforward story-based lyrics to her love for the honest storytelling style of country music, while the title track from her debut album was created with music of alternative rock bands The Flaming Lips and Arcade Fire in mind. She singled out the Beastie Boys as a major influence, telling Newsweek that she had always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> them and aspired to make [...] "youthful, irreverent anthems" [...] as well. She called her debut album, Animal, an homage to the Beastie Boys' Licensed to Ill and credited {{the creation of the}} rap driven [...] "Tik Tok" [...] to her love for the Beastie Boys' rap music. For her first headlining tour, Kesha wanted to emulate the stage theatrics of Iggy Pop. She listed Pop's The Idiot as well as Led Zeppelin and AC/DC as inspirations for her second studio album, Warrior, intended to feature 1970s rock inspired music. Warrior, to this effect, includes a collaboration with Pop himself.|$|E

2500|$|When Mozart was a toddler, Nannerl (four and a {{half years}} older) was his idol. According to Maynard Solomon, [...] "at three, Mozart was {{inspired}} to study music by observing his father's instruction of Marianne; he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> her." [...] The two children were very close, and they invented a secret language and an imaginary [...] "Kingdom of Back" [...] of which they were king and queen.

2500|$|Much {{criticism}} has been leveled at the drumming of Larry Herweg, with Grayson Currin writing for Pitchfork Media that he [...] "has consistently prevented his Chicago-based instrumental four-piece from being as transcendent as they've long been touted," [...] and {{that on this}} album [...] "it's worse than it's ever been, largely because it now seems that the excellent and consistently developing guitar duo of Laurent Schroeder-Lebec and Trevor de Brauw are better than they've ever been." [...] Pelican themselves are aware of this ubiquitous criticism. Guitarist Trevor de Brauw states in a Decibel feature that [...] "on the first two records, Pelican was a guitar band. On this one, we’re an actual band, which makes {{a world of difference}} to me", and that [...] "some people think of instrumental music as music where the players need to be shredding constantly. That was never the direction of Pelican—we never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Don Caballero or Hella." [...] An Allmusic review posits that on this release [...] "Herweg is allowed a far greater range of expression, and actually plays against the beat in places, seeming to be out of time, while creating a new space for the guitars to enter in terms of tempo and texture." ...|$|E
