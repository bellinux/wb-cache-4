5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's <b>will.</b> <b>People</b> were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E

30|$|All traditions will be reassessed, while {{simultaneously}} new traditions are created. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> no longer {{identify with the}} values of previous generations as they used to, and political class-consciousness of all kind <b>will</b> diminish. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> prefer weak ties to strong ones: social networks will be constituted around hobbies rather than around family or work.|$|R
50|$|From {{the four}} pillars of dharma—penance, charity, truthfulness, and compassion—charity {{will be all}} that remains, {{although}} it too <b>will</b> decrease daily. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> commit sin in mind, speech and action. Plague, famine, pestilence and natural calamities <b>will</b> appear. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> not believe one another, falsehoods will win disputes and brothers will become avaricious. As the each age progresses, the human life span decreases, starting from thousands {{of years in the}} Krutha Yuga to 100 years in the current Kali Yuga.|$|R
25|$|Wegner {{has applied}} this {{principle}} to the inferences people make {{about their own}} conscious <b>will.</b> <b>People</b> typically experience a thought {{that is consistent with}} a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference. Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused – and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, priming subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause. The implication for such work is that the perception of conscious will (which he says might be more accurately labelled as 'the emotion of authorship') is not tethered to the execution of actual behaviors, but is inferred from various cues through an intricate mental process, authorship processing. Although many interpret this work as a blow against the argument for free will, both psychologists and philosophers have criticized Wegner's theories.|$|E
500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How <b>will</b> <b>people</b> enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized {{there was a way}} to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E
500|$|Tammareddy Bharadwaja said [...] "Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera {{did well}} at the box office, {{the rest of the}} {{industry}} started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film. But what they don't realize is that if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe." [...] Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior. The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera. Producer Natti Kumar said [...] "If a hero delivers a hit, producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops. It's the same story with movies. Since Magadheera became a hit, every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores. They don't work on the script, story or relevance. It is a pure display of graphics, heroes' abs and grandeur. The plot is lost. Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then, but why <b>will</b> <b>people</b> want to see the same things again?".|$|E

2500|$|Cobb {{decided to}} use an {{abbreviated}} course of training. [...] "We weren't {{going to do it}} by traditional ways where they had to come for 20 hours (of training). [...] So they had to do it at one sitting—how long <b>will</b> <b>people</b> participate?—well, maybe three hours and that's pretty much the way it was." [...] Cobb cautiously did not state {{how long it would take}} to train 100,000 people. He had no idea. In fact it took only a few years and by the 20th anniversary of the citizen training program over half a million people in Seattle and the surrounding suburbs had received training in CPR.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: [...] "There'll be broad {{consensus}} {{around what}} Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the social partnership and the unity {{he brought to}} his own party. Also, he made Fianna Fáil the permanent party of government. They used {{to have all of}} the power most of the time, but now they have most of the power all of the time. All of that takes skill. But I wonder <b>will</b> <b>people</b> talk about 'Ahernism'? Is there any such thing? What does he actually stand for? In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around at the moment. He had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire in his belly. He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. But at the moment it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} years of World War II, Murgescu was a {{supporter}} of the fascist Iron Guard and, in his own definition, a theoretician of [...] "totalitarian" [...] politics. He began a collaboration with the newspaper Universul, where, as later recounted by his colleague Ștefan Baciu, {{he was one of the}} three staff writers who showed up for work wearing the Guard's green-colored shirts. Starting in August 1940, a full month before the Guard proclaimed its National Legionary regime, Murgescu published a series of political musings in Universul. These were soon after collected as a brochure, Note pentru Statul Totalitar ("Notes on the Totalitarian State"). The newspaper's literary chronicler, Constantin Fântâneru, presented Murgescu as [...] "that model of an author who will <b>will</b> <b>people</b> over to a doctrine simply by outlining clearly its ideas." [...] The brochure quoted at length from the speeches of Benito Mussolini and Iron Guard leader Horia Sima. Envisaging the birth of a [...] "new man", [...] "strong, lively, and immaculate", it called for a non-violent [...] "moral revolution" [...] to bring Romania into the [...] "New European Order". It sought to rebuild culture around the Guard's [...] "Legionary spirit", and promised artistic freedom [...] "only to ethnic Romanians." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eberhard Grisebach {{visited him}} in March, writing to Helen Spengler of Kirchner's condition: [...] "I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never forget. I found him sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later <b>will</b> <b>people</b> understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E

[...] It will feature popular PC-based games from well-known game publishers. Mplayer's features will include voice-capable games and chat rooms where players can converse as they play the games, watch games in progress and choose teams or opponents. In February 1997, they began to offer internet play for free for their major commercial games such as Quake, as well as card and board games such as Scrabble and Spades. In this, they {{were one of the}} first major commercial communities on the internet to offer such a service. They continued to add many new games to their offering.
