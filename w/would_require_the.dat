The plan would be the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road's Pacific extension to Seattle, Washington, in 1909.|$|E
5|$|The {{schools would}} be {{inspected}} by Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools, would have {{one third of}} their governing bodies appointed by the LEA, and <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> approval of the Secretary of State to raise fees or carry out building work.|$|E

5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. He decided that he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E
50|$|Large-scale {{property}} acquisition {{proved to}} be one of the most contentious issues, with the very large designs of several freeway interchanges seemingly undertaken without expectations of such an issue. The Noarlunga Freeway alone <b>would</b> have <b>required</b> <b>the</b> acquisition as many as 3,000 properties, including 817 residential dwellings. The Hills Freeway <b>would</b> have <b>required</b> <b>the</b> demolition of significant areas of the historic suburbs of inner south-eastern Adelaide.|$|R

5|$|On 22 March 1990, Achebe {{was riding}} in a car to Lagos when an axle {{collapsed}} and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but {{the weight of the}} vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> use of a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Since its nomination, {{numerous}} {{changes and}} renovations have occurred. The surrounding area {{has seen the}} construction of condominiums and the large manufacturing building being renovated and re-purposed for loft-style apartments. Renovations on {{the northern end of}} the property <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> demolition of two buildings to construct the Integrated Day Charter School. Completed in 2008, a new two-story addition created an indoor gymnasium, kitchen, offices and a new lobby for the school.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Brooks, the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show, wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches. He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. When Groening realized that animating Life in Hell <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Medal of Honor, {{one for each of}} the military departments of the Department of Defense: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version. Each is constructed differently and the components are made from gilding metals and red brass alloys with some gold plating, enamel, and bronze pieces. The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> Medal of Honor to be made with 90% gold, the same composition as the lesser-known Congressional Gold Medal, but the measure was dropped.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E

50|$|However, this <b>would</b> <b>require</b> {{inverting}} <b>the</b> {{hash function}} that produced passwordi−1 using passwordi (H(passwordi−1) = passwordi), which {{is extremely difficult}} to do with current cryptographic hash functions.|$|R
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> army of Xerxes to {{travel through the}} very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill <b>would</b> <b>require.</b> <b>The</b> brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 that <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid {{millions of dollars to}} create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>the</b> thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E
50|$|This method <b>would</b> first <b>require</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} of a space station with a system of gigantic lenses. Then the station would be transported toward the Sun.|$|R
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{route for}} an O-Bahn was for an alignment {{adjacent to the}} Noarlunga Centre railway line from {{the city to the}} Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn <b>would</b> <b>require</b> moving <b>the</b> railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass <b>would</b> <b>require</b> alteration. <b>The</b> estimated cost of construction, $182million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on road upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.|$|R
