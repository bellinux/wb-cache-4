500|$|Ellis {{admitted}} {{not being}} {{very familiar with}} the character, saying: [...] "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating {{and his eyes were}} always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."" ...|$|E

She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. But I {{think it was an}} advantage that they split up <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
2500|$|Parker was {{inspired}} to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, [...] "I used to draw a lot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> and I used {{to get the most}} immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following his win at the Brands Hatch {{meeting of}} the 2007 World Touring Car Championship season, Andy Priaulx {{dedicated}} it to McRae, commenting that his death [...] "shows how fragile life can be". McRae's former rival, four-time World Rally Champion Tommi Mäkinen commented the helicopter accident as terrifying news, and described McRae as [...] "a pleasant fellow and a tough rival". Valentino Rossi, who was taught the basics of driving a rally car by McRae, said he was shocked and saddened by the sudden departure of the former World Rally Champion. Valentino dedicated his win at Estoril MotoGp in 2007 to Colin McRae saying to the media [...] "I want to dedicate this to Colin McRae. He {{was one of my}} big idols <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> and it's because of him I have a big passion for rally".|$|E

I came here <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> {{and the greater}} part of my life has been passed on this little island. It is my home--my country." ...|$|E

'And I remember very well how, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> I {{used to go to}} the milking, look on at the skimming, sleep through the churning, and make believe I helped her. Ah, that was a happy time enough!' ...|$|E
60|$|Such {{are a few}} of the uncommercial {{journeys}} that I {{was forced}} to make, against my will, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> and unreasoning. And really, as to the latter part of them, it is not so very long ago-- now I come to think of it--that I was asked to undertake them once again, with a steady countenance.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{must have}} been <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> child, before I went to the army, where we look more at the young than at the old women. But, why a wife?

5000|$|... “For {{a couple}} of years, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impressionable my dad was the {{spokesman}} for the fire department, so it wasn’t uncommon to see him on TV or hear his voice on the radio," [...] Rummell said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm half American myself, you know. I {{used to live}} in New York <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> small, but I've almost {{forgotten}} what it <b>was</b> like. <b>I</b> remember a sort of overhead railway that made an awful noise...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon for {{interrupting}} you, sir,' returned Bitzer; 'but I am sure {{you know that the}} whole social system is a question of self-interest. What you must always appeal to, is a person's self-interest. It's your only hold. We are so constituted.

6000|$|In {{the case}} of Dr. Holmes's books, I am very {{sensible}} of this disenchanting effect of time and experience. [...] "The Professor at the Breakfast Table" [...] and the novels came into my hands <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> in [...] "green, unknowing youth." [...] They seemed extraordinary, new, fantasies of wisdom and wit; the reflections were such as surprised me by their depth, the illustrations dazzled by their novelty and brilliance. Probably they will still be as fortunate with young readers, and I am to be pitied, I hope, rather than blamed, if I cannot, like the wise thrush-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> I {{yearned to}} know other people's opinion {{of me and}} all my works; now, my chief aim is to avoid hearing it. In those days, had any one told me there was half a line about myself in a newspaper, I should have tramped London to obtain that publication. Now, when I see a column headed with my name, I hurriedly fold up the paper and put it away from me, subduing my natural curiosity to read it by saying to myself, [...] "Why should you? It will only upset you for the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} {{remember}} several things. At first, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> humble and apologetic, you {{made it easier for}} me by saying that you could only condemn my conduct on the ground of being socially unwise. Remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the Whiskered Friskers <b>are</b> really <b>very</b> clever," [...] he replied.

6000|$|... "Not {{too scared}} to come back, anyway," [...] said Longbill himself, {{dropping}} down {{just in front of}} Peter. [...] "I recognized you just as I was disappearing over the tops of the bushes, so I came right back. I learned <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards {{whether or not there is}} real danger. I am glad it is no one but you, Peter, for I was having a splendid meal here, and I should have hated to leave it. You'll excuse me while I go on eating, I hope. We can talk between bites." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But this is {{my special}} hobby, and the {{differences}} are equally obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types {{is one of the}} most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> I confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday's issue." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> a {{distinguished}} Review was still younger. I remember reading {{one of the}} earliest numbers, being then myself a boy of ten, and coming on a review of a novel. Never, as it seemed to me, or seems to my memory, was a poor novel more heavily handled: and yet I felt that the book must be a book to read on the very earliest opportunity. It was [...] "Westward Ho!" [...] the most famous, and perhaps the best novel, of Charles Kingsley. Often one has read it since, and it is an example of those large, rich, well-fed romances, at which you can cut and come again, as it were, laying it down, and taking it up on occasion, with the certainty of being excited, amused--and preached at.|$|E
6000|$|... "No drop shall pass my lips, Jim, if {{you will}} swear, wet or shine, blow or snow, {{to come up here}} twice in every week, that I may see you and speak with you, for, indeed, there <b>are</b> times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> lonesome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose there}} is nothing {{medicinal}} in it?" [...] said Bastin. [...] "Once <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> thirsty, <b>I</b> {{made a mistake and}} drank three tumblers of something of the sort in the dark, thinking that it <b>was</b> Apollinaris, and <b>I</b> don't want to do it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The orchard doesn't {{seem the}} same place by {{moonlight}} at all," [...] said the Story Girl dreamily. [...] "It's lovely, but it's different. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> small <b>I</b> used to believe the fairies danced in it on moonlight nights. I {{would like to believe}} it now but I can't." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never was}} much subject to violent {{political}} humours or accesses of feelings. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> I wrote and spoke very enthusiastically, {{but it was}} always on subjects connected with some grand general principle, the violation of which I thought I could point out. As to mere details of administration, I honestly thought that ministers, and men in office, must, of course, know much better than any private person could possibly do; and it was not till I went to Malta, and had to correspond with official characters myself, that I fully understood the extreme shallowness and ignorance with which men of some note too were able, after a certain fashion, to carry on the government of important departments of the empire. I then quite assented to Oxenstiern's saying, Nescis, mi fili, quam parva sapientia regitur mundus.|$|E
60|$|She was a {{woman who}} was easily satisfied. As a proof of this, I may say that she looked upon me as a man who always did what was right. Indeed, I am quite sure there were cases when she saved herself a good deal of perplexing cogitation by {{assuming}} that a thing was right because I did it. I was her only grandchild: my father and mother had died <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> and I had always lived with her,--that is, her house had always been my home; and as I am sure there had never been any reason why I should not be a dutiful and affectionate grandson, it was not surprising that she looked upon me with a certain tender partiality, and that she considered me worthy of all the good that she or fortune could bestow upon me.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{black and}} white. But I {{was going to}} tell you my troubles. My father was harpooned <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> and I {{remember}} how bravely he died. The Rights usually run away when they see a whaler coming; not from cowardice,--oh, dear, no!--but discretion. The Sperms stay and fight, and are killed off very fast; for they are a very headstrong family. We fight when we can't help it; and my father died like a hero. They chased him five hours before they stuck him; he tried to get away, and dragged three or four boats and sixteen hundred fathoms of line from eight in the morning till four at night. Then they got out another line, and he towed the ship itself for more than an hour. There were fifteen harpoons in him: he chewed up a boat, pitched several men overboard, and damaged the vessel, before they killed him. Ah! he was a father to be proud of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{very bad}} poetry, but <b>I</b> felt it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote it, one day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> lonely, {{and had a}} good cry on a rag bag. I {{never thought it would}} go where it could tell tales," [...] said Jo, tearing up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.|$|R
5000|$|At {{an early}} age, Jerry Mander moved {{with his family}} from the Bronx to a semi-rural area of Yonkers, New York.

"I {{started singing}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young," [...] stated Chaudhuri in his Atma Katha, [...] "With my {{naturally}} sonorous voice I could correctly reproduce the tunes that fell upon my ears." [...] Chaudhuri's {{love of music}} derived from his mother and in the cultural atmosphere of Krishnanagar it developed into a passion for him.|$|R
