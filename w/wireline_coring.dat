40|$|The {{sea floor}} drill rig MeBo (acronym for Meeresboden-Bohrgerät, German for sea floor drill rig) is a robotic drill rig that is {{deployed}} {{on the sea}} floor and operated remotely from the research vessel to drill up to 80 m into the sea floor. It was developed at the MARUM Research Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at Bremen University. The complete system – comprising the drill rig, winch, control station, and the launch and recovery system – is transported in six containers and can be deployed worldwide from German and international research ships. It was the first remote-controlled deep sea drill rig to use a <b>wireline</b> <b>coring</b> technique. Compared to drilling vessels this technology {{has the advantage of}} operating from a stable platform at the sea bed, which allows for optimal control over the drilling process. Especially for shallow drillings in the range of tens to hundreds of metres, sea bed drill rigs are time-efficient since no drill string has to be assembled from the ship to the sea floor before the first core can be taken. The MeBo has been successfully operated, retrieving high-quality cores at the sea bed for a variety of research fields, including slope stability studies and palaeoclimate reconstructions. Based on experience with the MeBo, a rig is now being built that will be able to drill to a depth of 200 m...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of permeability prediction from <b>wireline</b> logging and <b>core</b> data from Assam-Arakan basin. Applicability and suitability of empirical methods for permeability prediction using <b>wireline</b> log and <b>core</b> data are tested, and the suitable one is applied for the purpose. The empirical relationship has allowed estimation of Buckles’ number using <b>wireline</b> and <b>core</b> measurements. The formation porosity/irreducible water saturation and permeability from digital well log and core data are estimated using Buckles’ method approach. The Buckles’ number estimated from empirical relationship using <b>wireline</b> and <b>core</b> measurements can be further utilized to predict permeability in the wells from the same reservoir in which only well log data are available. Hence, from this study it can be concluded that once the basic porosity/water saturation/permeability relations are established using the core data, these relations can be further used in the other wells from the same reservoir where core data are not available. The porosity crossplots indicate a good agreement between log data determined porosity and ELAN interpreted porosity. The predicted permeability from empirical equation and core derived permeability are in good agreement with each other. The estimated values of Buckles’ number for both the reservoirs support the fact that Buckles’ number increases with the finer-grained rock. Well-A produces oil from Langpar reservoir, whereas the Well-B is producing gas from Langpar as well as LK[*]+[*]Th reservoir of Eocene age. The oil sand in the Langpar reservoir has the higher permeability than the gas sands in Langpar and Lk[*]+[*]Th reservoirs.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the chemical evolution of Walker Lake and past changes in the Walker River hydrologic system, the Walker Lake subbasin in California and Nevada has been the site of gravity, piston, and rotary <b>wireline</b> <b>coring</b> activities since 1975. Chemical and physical measurements made on sediments and pore fluids from these cores indicate that Walker Lake has undergone significant changes in size over the past 360, 000 years. From 360, 000 to 130, 000 years before present (1950), Walker Lake frequently was shallow or dry. From about 130, 000 to 21, 000 years before present, the water level in Walker Lake was at moderate or high levels. From about 21, 000 to 15, 000 years before present, Walker Lake was extremely shallow and probably desiccated numerous times. Sediments representing the last Lake Lahontan highstand, that occurred between 14, 000 and 12, 500 years before present, were not recovered during offshore coring. For the past 10, 000 years, the water level in Walker Lake has been at moderate to low levels and probably desiccated twice {{since the end of the}} last highstand that occurred 12, 500 years before present; that is, those desiccations occurred greater than or equal to 4, 700 years before present and again 2, 600 years before present. Desiccations of Walker Lake can be attributed to changes in climate or diversion of the Walker River into the Carson River drainage (Benson and Thompson, 1987 a).

Nevertheless, high resolution information remains sparse for the Cenozoic and in particular the Neogene sedimentation history of the region. Modern high quality coring techniques have not yet been applied and data sets relevant to resolve the development and variability of the Benguela Current system since Miocene times are hence still fragmentary.

40|$|A {{software}} package called DFNModeler {{has been developed}} to assess the potential risks associated with carbon sequestration in coal. Natural fractures provide the principal conduits for fluid flow in coal-bearing strata, and these fractures present the most tangible risks for the leakage of injected carbon dioxide. The objectives {{of this study were}} to develop discrete fracture network (DFN) modeling tools for risk assessment and to use these tools to assess risks in the Black Warrior Basin of Alabama, where coal-bearing strata have high potential for carbon sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. DFNModeler provides a user-friendly interface for the construction, visualization, and analysis of DFN models. DFNModeler employs an OpenGL graphics engine that enables real-time manipulation of DFN models. Analytical capabilities in DFNModeler include display of structural and hydrologic parameters, compartmentalization analysis, and fluid pathways analysis. DFN models can be exported to third-party {{software package}}s for flow modeling. DFN models were constructed to simulate fracturing in coal-bearing strata of the upper Pottsville Formation in the Black Warrior Basin. Outcrops and <b>wireline</b> <b>cores</b> were used to characterize fracture systems, which include joint systems, cleat systems, and fault-related shear fractures. DFN models were constructed to simulate jointing, cleating, faulting, and hydraulic fracturing. Analysis of DFN models indicates that strata-bound jointing compartmentalizes the Pottsville hydrologic system and helps protect shallow aquifers from injection operations at reservoir depth. Analysis of fault zones, however, suggests that faulting can facilitate cross-formational flow. For this reason, faults should be avoided when siting injection wells. DFN-based flow models constructed in TOUGH 2 indicate that fracture aperture and connectivity are critical variables affecting the leakage of injected CO{sub 2 } from coal. Highly transmissive joints near an injection well have potential to divert a large percentage of an injected CO{sub 2 } stream away from a target coal seam. However, the strata-bound nature of Pottsville fracture systems is a natural factor that mitigates the risk of long-range leakage and surface seepage. Flow models indicate that cross-formational flow in strata-bound joint networks is low and is dissipated by about an order of magnitude at each successive bedding contact. These models help confirm that strata-bound joint networks are self-compartmentalizing and that the thick successions of interbedded shale and sandstone separating the Pottsville coal zones are confining units that protect shallow aquifers from injection operations at reservoir depth. DFN models are powerful tools for the simulation and analysis of fracture networks and can {{play an important role in}} the assessment of risks associated with carbon sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. Importantly, the stochastic nature DFN models dictates that they cannot be used to precisely reproduce reservoir conditions in a specific field area. Rather, these models are most useful for simulating the fundamental geometric and statistical properties of fracture networks. Because the specifics of fracture architecture in a given area can be uncertain, multiple realizations of DFN models and DFN-based flow models can help define variability that may be encountered during field operations. Using this type of approach, modelers can inform the risk assessment process by characterizing the types and variability of fracture architecture that may exist in geologic carbon sinks containing natural fractures...|$|R

A very dense and well-constrained database (2200 wells, 18 cores and 4 outcrops) derived from petroleum exploration {{made it possible}} to implement and test common workflows and terminologies used for sequence stratigraphic analysis along an ancient wave-dominated margin. Following facies definition from cores and outcrops and recognition of associated well-log patterns, a two-step approach allows for the reconstruction of large-scale geometries: 1) the model-independent definition of surfaces and units; and 2) the interpretation of the sequence boundaries and systems tracts based on a depositional sequence model. The typical facies association and log pattern of different sedimentary environments including tidal, as well as wave-dominated foreshore, shoreface and offshore settings are presented. The spatial distribution of characteristic sedimentary environments associated with stratigraphic surfaces and systems tracts is also detailed at the basin scale. Among other results, this study highlights the differences in the sedimentary facies geometries across two different types of sequence boundaries: the facies geometries of the first sequence boundary are quite similar to Haq et al.

Periods of entrenchment and aggradation within the different valley elements were associated with regional climate changes. In the second study, data compiled from aerial photography, general Land Office maps (GLOs), and discharge data of the Platte River braided channel were used to provide new insight toward the understanding and quantification of channel evolution and partial abandonment of the central Platte River. Analysis of aerial photographs and GLOs in ArcMap™ show that channel areas and widths decreased from 1858 to 2006. Stabilization through vegetation of bars and channel banks is cited as the major contributing factor to the development of anabranching system within the boundaries of the 1858 channel. The Wood River, a tributary to the Platte River, has also experienced channel evolution {{in the form of an}} increase in sinuosity, after occupying an abandoned channel of the Platte River at the beginning of the 20 th century. Platte River channel evolution is explained using a channel abandonment model that accounts for the gradual abandonment of the Platte River and its evolution from a braided to an anabranching system. ^ In the third study, <b>wireline</b> logs, sediment <b>cores,</b> aerial photography, and ground penetrating radar (GPR) data from the central and lower Platte River channel were used to reformulate the vertical sequence alluvial facies and bar initiation models of the Platte River.

The area is adequately covered by several vintages of 2 D and focused 3 D seismic data which have been primarily used for subsurface imaging. Further, the depositional units have been identified by interpreting seismic stratal patterns and facies distribution in a sequence stratigraphic framework. This is supplemented by information from <b>wireline</b> logs and <b>cores.</b> The gradational facies pattern, sequence boundary, transgressive surface, maximum flooding surface, channel architecture, etc. have been demonstrated in selected seismic sections for developing the concept. The study is not only useful in understanding the depositional processes in shelf/shelf-edge/deepwater and their linkages {{but also as a}} good guide for the deepwater hydrocarbon exploration targets...|$|R

The main {{reservoir}} hydrocarbon target mostly in upper part Zelda Member of Talang Akar Formation with the thickness of the layer about 53 ft, but there is a potential hydrocarbon reservoir characteristics in lower part Zelda Member of Talang Akar Formation represented by basal sand layer with the maximum thickness 26 ft. Basal sand layer is dominated of sandstone with fragments derived from igneous rock basement (granodiorite) of this basin. This study purpose to determine the distribution of Discrete Rock Type (DRT) Facies, basal sand layer are classified based on the value of DRT to facies sedimentation, which is obtained using the method of Rock Typing (Amaefule et al, 1993). The data that used for this study are <b>wireline</b> log, <b>core,</b> and seismic interpretation. Rock Typing a quantitative method of rock classification into multiple units using its petrophysical properties such as porosity, permeability and clay volume, parameter of this petrophysical properties will be used to determine the value of Reservoir Quality Index (RQI) which is equal to 0. 0314 √(k/), Normalized Porosity Index (z) which is equal to /(1 -), then get the value of Flow Zone Unit (FZI) which is equal to RQI/, {{so that it can be}} determined the classification of rock as Discrete Rock Type (DRT). Based on grouping of the data on the curves cross plot between z VS RQI, obtained 5 grouping rock types (DRT) there are DRT 0 (FZI = 0. 9 µm).

40|$|The Cambro-Ordovician {{strata of}} the Illinois and Michigan Basins {{underlie}} {{most of the}} states of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Michigan. This interval also extends {{through much of the}} Midwest of the United States and, for some areas, may be the only available target for geological sequestration of CO{sub 2 }. We evaluated the Cambro-Ordovician strata above the basal Mt. Simon Sandstone reservoir for sequestration potential. The two targets were the Cambrian carbonate intervals in the Knox and the Ordovician St. Peter Sandstone. The evaluation of these two formations was accomplished using <b>wireline</b> data, <b>core</b> data, pressure data, and seismic data from the USDOE-funded Illinois Basin â Decatur Project being conducted by the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium in Macon County, Illinois. Interpretations were completed using log analysis software, a reservoir flow simulator, and a finite element solver that determines rock stress and strain changes resulting from the pressure increase associated with CO{sub 2 } injection. Results of this research suggest that both the St. Peter Sandstone and the Potosi Dolomite (a formation of the Knox) reservoirs may be capable of storing up to 2 million tonnes of CO{sub 2 } per year for a 20 -year period. Reservoir simulation results for the St. Peter indicate good injectivity and a relatively small CO{sub 2 } plume. While a single St. Peter well is not likely to achieve the targeted injection rate of 2 million tonnes/year, results {{of this study indicate that}} development with three or four appropriately spaced wells may be sufficient. Reservoir simulation of the Potosi suggest that much of the CO{sub 2 } flows into and through relatively thin, high permeability intervals, resulting in a large plume diameter compared with the St. Peter...|$|R
40|$|Almera- 1 {{borehole}} was drilled {{to provide}} a borehole geophysical logging and downhole monitoring research and training facility. Also a main objective was {{the exploration of the}} urban subsurface geology adjacent to the Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera (CSIC) in Barcelona the University of Barcelona Pedralbes. <b>Wireline</b> drilling continuous <b>coring</b> was successfully applied to recover cores from the entire section (214 m). Since 2011 Almera- 1 hole has been extensively used for slim hole logging, coring and monitoring. Total depth was reached after drilling a Quaternary to Paleozoic section. The upper section of Almera- 1 hole is cased with PVC and the lowermost is an open hole section within the Paleozoic section. A complete set of geophysical logging measurements and oriented borehole images was acquired with CSIC own slim hole logging equipment both in open hole mode and through the PVC casing. Logging measurements were acquired over the entire section. Open hole measurements included acoustic and optical imaging, spectral natural gamma ray, full wave acoustic logging, magnetic susceptibility, hydrochemical-temperature logs and fluid sampling. Through casing (PVC casing) measurements included spectral gamma ray logging, full wave sonic and acoustic televiewer. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Combined seismic {{and well}} {{interpretation}} methods {{can be used}} to elucidate detail of the subsurface architecture of fluvial and fluvio-deltaic deposits. Observations made from <b>wireline</b> and <b>core</b> logs, including facies and analysing the relative proportions of architectural elements and facies associations indicative of depositional sub-environments, {{can be used to}} interpret patterns of cyclicity, changes in local accommodation conditions, and periods of increased seasonal, tidal and marine influence. Horizon slices, taken from 3 D seismic volumes aid in the visualisation of laterally discontinuous, often thinly-bedded, fluvial deposits. Seismic facies, when combined with <b>core</b> and <b>wireline</b> log facies, can be interpreted as a series of ‘seismic elements’. The relative proportions of seismic elements mapped out on horizon slices allows the interpretation of depositional environments and accommodation setting; allowing the distinction between fluvial and deltaic settings. A number of data conditioning and seismic interpretation techniques can be used to enhance the visualisation of channelized and non-channelized fluvio-deltaic deposits in the subsurface. Frequency decomposition (and the making of colour-blended volumes) allows the visualisation of the detail of channel belt deposits such as channel belt migration and lateral accretion deposits. Allogenic processes, particularly base-level (buttress) rise and fall have been shown to exert a control on the overall stacking pattern of the studied fluvio-deltaic deposits, whereas autogenic processes are interpreted as the major control on the local arrangement and architecture of channel belt and overbank deposits. The first study in this thesis uses the Upper Permian Rangal Coal Measures, a large-scale fluvial system, which accumulated in a foreland basin setting in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, Australia. The study investigates the architecture and connectivity of splay and distributary channels. The second study uses the Late Triassic Mungaroo Formation, a Mississippi-scale fluvio-deltaic system with a fluvially-dominated, tidally-influenced delta, which accumulated in the Northern Carnarvon Basin, Northwest Shelf, Australia. The study investigates different seismic interpretation techniques and investigates the relative control on fluvio-deltaic deposition of allogenic and autogenic processes. ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the San Andreas fault (SAF) zone properties, brittle and ductile behavior, {{and fluid}} flow in active tectonic environments require an {{integrated}} approach between core, downhole, and surface measurements. For this reason, {{it is important}} to reconcile these different measurements in SAF pilot hole to improve the interpretation process and better understand the fault zone mechanics and deformation patterns over a broad range of spatial scales. Core measurements represent the finer end of the spectrum where cross-cutting joints and fractures, hydrothermal alteration, and deformation are easily identified but are not geographically oriented or vertically continuous because of lack of core recovery in highly altered or fractured intervals, such as near the SAF. Some of these features may be observed using downhole or seismic techniques, which are oriented. Using digital core and log images together (digital scanning of whole cores, FMI, BHTV, and LWD) structural features such as fractures, foliation, and veins can be oriented by correlation with the downhole images (Goldberg, 1997; Scientific Staff Leg 176, 1999; Haggas et al., 2001). These core-log and core-core integration studies in the SAF pilot hole will provide a critical basis for the interpretation of Logging While Drilling (LWD) image data in the SAF zone drilling project. Azimuthal borehole images recorded using LWD tools over the inclined hole interval (SAF phase II drilling) will provide image data that otherwise cannot be achieved using wireline FMI or BHTV tools. Although sensing the ephemeral and variable properties through the fault zone, the vertical resolution of LWD logs is lower than <b>wireline</b> and <b>core</b> measurements and their depth of registration is significantly different. Therefore, {{it is important to}} correlate core and log images and reconcile different depth scales in the SAF pilot hole so that future LWD logs and images can be accurately interpreted, especially in the inclined hole where <b>core</b> and <b>wireline</b> log measurements may not be available...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{more than}} a decade of {{intensive}} coal seam gas exploration and development in the Surat Basin, fundamental aspects surrounding the sedimentary organisation of the Walloon Subgroup remain unresolved. While generally agreed to have been deposited on a waterlogged alluvial plain, contradictory paleogeographic models describe the Walloon Subgroup as an internally draining fluvio-lacustrine system or, alternatively, as a southeast-prograding distributive trunk drainage system. The former invokes a radially organised fluvial catchment feeding a basin depocentre, suggesting that rivers within the study area flowed from east to west. In contrast, a prograding trunk drainage system assumes an axial system flowing southeastward towards a distant paleocoastline. Without a unifying conceptual model describing the organisation of the Jurassic depositional system, predictions about the distribution of alluvial subenvironments within the Surat Basin are difficult. This study tests previous hypotheses surrounding the Walloon Subgroup 2 ̆ 7 s sedimentary organisation by reconstructing regional variations in alluvial architecture, fluvial styles and sediment dispersal patterns. The workflow integrates borehole image log interpretation, <b>wireline</b> log analysis, <b>core</b> description and numerical modelling to explore the character and occurrence of subenvironments throughout the basin. Synthesis of interpretations suggests a composite meandering to anastomosing fluvial system containing both a south-oriented trunk drainage component and tributary rivers feeding the axial system from the east...|$|R
