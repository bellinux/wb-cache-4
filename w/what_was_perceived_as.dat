5|$|Solidifying his {{reputation}} as a hard-driving and assertive leader, Shoup rose through the senior leadership of the Marine Corps, overhauling fiscal affairs, logistics, and recruit training. He was selected as commandant by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and later served in the administration of John F. Kennedy. He reformed the Corps, emphasizing combat readiness and fiscal efficiency, against <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> politicking among its officers.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E

Many of makeshift trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Corcoran. On July 23, President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward visited Fort Corcoran in an effort to revive morale after the defeat at Bull Run.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1939, Orizaba was {{chartered}} to United States Lines {{as one of}} five ships {{added to}} increase <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a slow rate of return of US citizens fleeing war-torn Europe. In September, the ship was diverted to Galway to pick up American survivors of , torpedoed by U-30 on 3 September; Orizaba returned with 240 of the survivors later that month. After completing evacuation service, the ship was laid up in New York {{in the summer of}} 1940, and subsequently purchased by the Maritime Commission on behalf of the Army on 27 February 1941.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of the}} Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, {{tensions}} {{began to}} arise between <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, {{identified with a}} left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.|$|E
5|$|Infuriated by <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> {{yet another}} affront to British {{prestige}} after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, {{members of the}} British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait {{in spite of the}} Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss of rights to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|While the Potomac River forts {{were being}} built, {{planning}} and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts {{to protect the}} city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In {{the days that followed}} the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> an imminent Confederate attack. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington.|$|E

5|$|As {{foreseen}} by Secretary Laird, {{fallout from}} the incursion was quick in coming on the campuses of America's universities, as protests erupted against <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> {{an expansion of the}} conflict into yet another country. On 4 May the unrest escalated to violence when Ohio National Guardsmen shot and killed four unarmed students (two of whom were not protesters) during the Kent State shootings. Two days later, at the University at Buffalo, police wounded four more demonstrators. On 15 May city and state police killed two and wounded twelve at Jackson State College (now Jackson State University) in Jackson, Mississippi. Earlier, on 8 May 100,000 protesters had gathered in Washington and another 150,000 in San Francisco on only ten days notice. Nationwide, 30 ROTC buildings went up in flames or were bombed while 26 schools witnessed violent clashes between students and police. National Guard units were mobilized on 21 campuses in 16 states. The student strike spread nationwide, involving more than four million students and 450 universities, colleges and high schools in mostly peaceful protests and walkouts.|$|E
25|$|The beatification of Pius IX was controversial, and {{was criticized}} by some Jews and Christians because of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> his authoritarian, reactionary politics; the {{accusation}} of abuse of episcopal powers; and anti-Semitism (most specifically {{the case of}} Edgardo Mortara, but also his reinstituting the Roman ghetto).|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{development for}} soccer and adversely for Rugby Union was {{the establishment of}} the game as an official sport in the private schools in the early 1990s (see Great Public Schools Association of Queensland Inc.). Anecdotally, this move was very strongly resisted by the Rugby fraternity in the schools, as they wished to maintain <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the traditions of amateur football (Rugby was not to become a professional game officially until 1995). Since that time, the game has developed such that many schools now have as many soccer teams as they have Rugby teams.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with other}} reformers, Anna Carroll campaigned by writing against urban machine corruption, crime, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the {{political}} {{threat of the}} power of the Catholic Church. In Maryland the Catholic planter/urban vote could combine to establish a pro-slavery state government. In 1856, the Whig Party split nationally into Northern and Southern factions due to the slavery issue. During the 1856 presidential election, Carroll supported and campaigned on behalf of Fillmore, the Know Nothing candidate. Carroll wrote many articles and pamphlets and she toured the Northeast on his behalf. Considered a moderate, Fillmore carried the state of Maryland, his only victory in the election.|$|E

25|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, Clark was unable to raise all 350 men {{authorized}} for the Illinois Regiment. His recruiters had to compete with recruiters from the Continental Army and from other militia units. Some believed that Kentucky was too sparsely inhabited to warrant the diversion of manpower, and recommended {{that it should be}} evacuated rather than defended. Settlers in the Holston valley were more concerned with Cherokees to the south than with Indians north of the Ohio, and were reluctant to enlist in operations to the north. Although some Pennsylvanians enlisted in the Illinois Regiment, the longstanding boundary dispute between Pennsylvania and Virginia meant that few Pennsylvanians volunteered for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a campaign to protect Virginia territory.|$|E
25|$|Writer R. Marchal {{identifies}} two {{key events}} in Sino-African relations. First, the Tian'anmen protests in 1989; the spectacle consolidated opposition to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the PRC's violent oppression of demonstrators. Economically developed nations threatened to enforce economic sanctions, while African countries kept silent, either to conceal their own harsh policies or {{to further their}} ties with China. Indeed, that was the results as China's strengthened its cooperation with African states. The growing alliance between China and Africa was more and more needed for both sides. China's growing industry resulted in a rapidly expanding and seemingly inexhaustible demand for resources. Meanwhile, in the relative calm ushered in {{by the end of}} the cold war, concerns about human rights issues in China, furthered isolated the mix of rogue and pariah states.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016 Jillian Melchor {{wrote in}} the online {{publication}} Heat Street, based on internal emails reviewed by its staff and National Review, that the university had suffered significant damage to its reputation and image over its handling of the protests. This reaction was reflected in a barrage of highly critical correspondence from alumni, donors and the families of current and prospective students attacking <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the administration's unwarranted deference to campus extremists. According to the report {{there has been a}} sharp decline in donations, particularly to the Athletic Department, where donations were down by 72%. Enrollment in the freshmen class also dropped by around 25% and Melchor asserted that some current students were considering transferring to other schools. Altogether, some 2,273 fewer students enrolled at the Columbia campus for the fall 2016 semester, and the protests have been blamed at least in part for this decline.|$|E
