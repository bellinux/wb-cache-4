500|$|The filmmakers {{decided not}} to {{replicate}} the X-Men costumes {{as seen in the}} comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont supported this decision. Claremont joked, [...] "you can do that on a drawing, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on people it's disturbing!" [...] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line [...] "What would you prefer, yellow spandex?" [...] – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them [...] "blend into the night".|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{ranked the}} song amongst the top tracks on Kiss & Tell. Mikael Wood of Billboard gave the song a {{positive}} review, stating that it [...] "has a juicy and instantly memorable vocal hook". In {{a review of}} the album, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy coined the song [...] "electro-thumping", commenting that it was [...] "as innocent as the purity ring on Gomez's finger and showcases her polished vocals perfectly." [...] Copsey also stated that the impressive hooks present in the song do not appear on the album anywhere else. In a single review, Nick Levine also of Digital Spy said was the most Disney-affiliated single with club appeal since Miley Cyrus' [...] "See You Again". When commenting on whether Gomez would be a mainstay in music, Levine said, [...] "It's too soon to tell - but most Scando-popettes would dye their locks brunette for this tune." [...] Although stating that it was very cliche, a writer for Popjustice said that the song [...] "seems like a boundary-smashing avant garde curiosity <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> alongside most other Hollywood Records output." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com ranked [...] "Naturally" [...] at number eighty-four on his list of [...] "Top 100 Pop Songs of 2010".|$|E
500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death." ...|$|E

"That's {{all very}} well," [...] replied Mr. Paramor, [...] "but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into {{practice}} in that wholesale way {{it leads to}} goodness knows what. It means reconstructing marriage on a basis entirely different from the present. It's marriage {{on the basis of}} the heart, and not on the basis of property.

2500|$|... "Thought I Knew" [...] {{was also}} {{the name of a}} song by Brian Bell's band The Relationship, and is a {{reworking}} and re-recording of the track with Weezer sung as a lead vocal by Brian Bell. The song was originally written in a minor key. However, Bell felt that historically the band's songs haven't worked in minor and that the song needed to feel more uplifting. So he changed the song from minor to major and sped up the tempo. [...] "Cold Dark World" [...] is a song that was written by Rivers Cuomo and Scott Shriner and features Shriner on lead vocals. Shriner commented, [...] "...I wrote this kind of creepy music, and Rivers wrote these kind of happy, positive lyrics, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together, it made a super-creepy song which I'm really proud of." [...] "Automatic" [...] was written by Patrick Wilson and features him on lead vocals, saying that the song [...] "is interesting. It's a big rock tune but it's kinda got a vibe to it and the lyrics are just about me wanting to give as much love as I can to my family..." ...|$|E

5000|$|In August 1991, May {{was interviewed}} by Guitar World where {{he spoke of the}} song. [...] "As time goes by I find I'm more {{concerned}} with the lyrics than ever. A lot of people say you can only create when you're in pain. But when I was really in pain, I couldn't create anything. I couldn't even get out of bed. When you're climbing out and beginning to get things in the right boxes again, that's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into music. There's quite a bit of that sort of thing on this album. There's some in 'I Can't Live with You'; it's very personal, but I tried not to make it autobiographical because that narrows things too much. I tried to express it in a form that everyone can relate to." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, The {{composer}} of {{the show}} Ramin Djawadi spoke about the piano interpretations of Radiohead's [...] "No Surprises" [...] used in the episode. He said, [...] "When Jonathan says, 'Do a Radiohead song,' I say, 'Great!'" [...] Djawadi continued, [...] "This particular piece was pretty simple, actually. The opening arpeggiated riff from 'No Surprises' translates really well into piano." [...] He noted, [...] "The way I see it, it’s like a jukebox in a restaurant, <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> money in <b>it,</b> it plays preprogrammed pieces. These particular pieces that the piano plays help you {{with the sense of}} time, the repeats. It just marks time, and it provides the recognition factor that this is a preprogrammed event." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is possible," [...] {{interposed}} Lomaque. [...] "Listen to what I advise. We must depart for Paris by the diligence to-morrow morning, and we must take your sister with us--to-morrow will be time enough; people don't sign marriage-contracts on the evening after a long day's journey. We must go then, and we must take your sister. Leave the care of her in Paris, and the responsibility of keeping her in ignorance {{of what you are}} doing, to me. Go to this General Berthelin's house at a time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know Danville is there (we can get that knowledge through the servants); confront him without a moment's previous warning; confront him as a man risen from the dead; confront him before every soul in the room though the room should be full of people--and leave the rest to the self-betrayal of a panic-stricken man. Say but three words, and your duty will be done; you may return to your sister, and may depart with her in safety to your old retreat at Rouen, or where else you please, on the very day <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out of her infamous husband's power to add another to the list of his crimes." ...|$|R

5000|$|On {{her next}} start the filly {{returned}} to Group Two class {{for the first}} time since the Lowther when she ran in the Sandy Lane Stakes on 28 May at Haydock Park. Gifted Master (Pavilion Stakes) started favourite ahead of Buratino (Coventry Stakes) and La Rioja (Dick Poole Stakes) with Quiet Reflection on 7/1 alongside Donjuan Triumphant (Criterium de Maisons-Laffitte). After being restrained by Costello in the early stages she took the lead a furlong out and drew clear in [...] "impressive" [...] style to win by three and three quarter lengths. Costello said that the filly won in a [...] "hack canter", whilst Burke commented [...] "She's a different filly to the one that won in France April. She's physically matured since then and I knew she'd improved. It wasn't the idea to sit that far back but when I saw him cruise up on her two out, I thought he'd gone too soon. She's got a fantastic turn of foot and a high cruising speed and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> them together, <b>it</b> makes something special".|$|R
