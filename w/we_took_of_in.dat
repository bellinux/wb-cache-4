40|$|During {{vertebrate}} neural development, positional {{information is}} largely specified by extracellular morphogens. Their distribution, however, is very dynamic {{due to the}} multiple roles played by the same signals in the developing and adult neural tissue. This suggests that neural progenitors are able to modify their competence to respond to morphogen signalling and autonomously maintain positional identities after their initial specification. In this work, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> advantage <b>of</b> <b>in</b> vitro culture systems of mouse neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) to show that NSPCs isolated from rostral or caudal regions of the mouse neural tube are differentially responsive to retinoic acid (RA), a pivotal morphogen for the specification of posterior neural fates.

Correlating with these effects, key RA-responsive regulatory regions in the Hoxb cluster displayed opposite enrichment of activating or repressing histone marks in rostral and caudal NSPCs. Finally, RA was able to strengthen Hoxb chromatin activation in caudal NSPCs, but was ineffective on the repressed Hoxb chromatin of rostral NSPCs. These results suggest that the response of NSPCs to morphogen signalling across the rostrocaudal axis of the neural tube may be gated by the epigenetic configuration of target patterning genes, allowing long-term maintenance of intrinsic positional values <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> continuously changing extrinsic signals...|$|R

Earlier, we found that TPH 2 up-regulated <b>in</b> the hippocampus <b>of</b> postnatal rats after the oral treatment of Bacopa monniera leaf extract containing the active compound bacosides. However, the knowledge about the interactions between bacosides with TPH is limited. In this study, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> advantage <b>of</b> <b>in</b> silico approach to understand the interaction of bacoside-TPH complex using three different docking algorithms such as Hex-Dock, PatchDock and AutoDock. All these three algorithms showed that bacoside A and A 3 well fit into the cavity consists of active sites. Further, our analysis revealed that major active compounds bacoside A 3 and A interact with different residues of TPH through hydrogen bond. Interestingly, Tyr 235, Thr 265 and Glu 317 are the key residues among them, but none of them are either at tryptophan or BH 4 binding region. However, its note worthy to mention that Tyr 235 is a catalytic sensitive residue, Thr 265 is present in the flexible loop region and Glu 317 is known to interacts with Fe. Interactions with these residues may critically regulate TPH function and thus serotonin synthesis.

Human genes without orthologs in distant species ('young' genes) tend to be tissue-specific in their expression.
