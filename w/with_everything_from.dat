It is an upper income neighborhood although it has had problems associated with urban decay.

25|$|Galleys from 4th century BC up to {{the time}} of the early Roman Empire in the 1st century AD became {{successively}} larger. Three levels of oars was the practical upper limit, but it was improved on by making ships longer, broader and heavier and placing more than one rower per oar. Naval conflict grew more intense and extensive, and by 100 BC galleys with four, five or six rows of oarsmen were commonplace and carried large complements of soldiers and catapults. With high freeboard (up to 3m) and additional tower structures from which missiles could be shot down onto enemy decks, they were intended to be like floating fortresses. Designs <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> eight rows of oarsmen and upwards were built, but most of them are believed to have been impractical show pieces never used in actual warfare. Ptolemy IV, the Greek pharaoh of Egypt 221–205 BC, is recorded as building a gigantic ship with forty rows of oarsmen, though no specification of its design remains. One suggested design was that of a huge trireme catamaran with up to 14 men per oar and it is assumed that it was intended as a showpiece rather than a practical warship.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards Laundry Service {{ranged from}} favourable to mixed, with critics expressing different opinions regarding {{the production and}} composition of the album. Alex Henderson from AllMusic commended Shakira's songwriting abilities in English, calling it a [...] "challenge that she handles impressively well. Shakira, it turns out, sings quite convincingly in English," [...] and also praised her different mixes of musical styles, saying [...] "Like Shakira's Spanish-language albums, this self-produced CD is enjoyably eclectic; she successfully combines pop/rock <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> tango on [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and Andean music on [...] "Whenever, Wherever" [...] to Middle Eastern music on [...] "Eyes Like Yours". He concluded that [...] "Dónde Están los Ladrones? remains Shakira's most essential album, but Laundry Service is an excellent English-language debut for the South American vocalist." [...] A critic from Billboard also favoured the presence of various musical styles on the album and commented that [...] "Laundry Service finds the 24-year-old artist unafraid of merging musical flavors," [...] and complimented Shakira's vocal talent. Similarly, the Entertainment.ie review of the album deemed the lyrical content [...] "surreal" [...] and the production [...] "no less bizarre [...] imposing breakneck tangos, twanging guitar solos and bizarre raps onto a familiar soft rock template." [...] They felt that Laundry Service could not be called a [...] "great album", reasoning that [...] "the line between fascinatingly strange and offputtingly weird is a thin one, and Laundry Service crosses it far too often," [...] but also stated that [...] "Even so, Shakira's star quality can hardly be denied - and in today's increasingly conformist pop industry that deserves at least two cheers." ...|$|E

The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 121 vessels to the armada, including destroyers, frigates, corvettes, landing ships, minesweepers and torpedo boats. Four Canadian [...] Tribal-class destroyers were in the Royal Navy's 10th Destroyer Flotilla, which joined other RN units in keeping the English Channel near Normandy clear of German naval units. Naval Force J had begun intense training for the invasion with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division in February 1944, with a full-scale simulation of the invasion carried out on 4 May in Exercise Fabius. On D-Day itself, Force J, commanded from , was to bombard German defensive positions along the landing zone <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> heavy-calibre cruiser guns to self-propelled artillery attached to landing craft. According to Canadian Army Historian C. P. Stacey, a light bombardment of the landing zone would commence [...] "30 minutes before H Hour and continue for 15 minutes; heavy bombing would then begin on the flanks of the divisional attack, lasting until H Hour". Additional cover would be provided by Royal and Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons both before and on D-Day. A successful surprise invasion required total air superiority over the English Channel and Normandy. In the months preceding D-Day, the RAF Second Tactical Air Force attacked airfields, coastal garrisons, radar, railway lines and transport routes in order to soften the beach defences, as well as prevent the German Luftwaffe from mounting a serious challenge to air superiority over Normandy. By dawn, on 6 June, the RAF tactical air forces had 2,434 fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft with approximately 700 light and medium bombers to support them.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Variety, Justin Chang said: [...] "One of the film's more {{remarkable}} achievements is that, despite their obvious differences {{in class and}} background, Therese and Carol seem to ease themselves (and the audience) so quickly and naturally into a bond {{that they have no}} interest in defining, or even really discussing — a choice that works not only for an era when their love dared not speak its name, but also for Haynes’ faith {{in the power of the}} medium to achieve an eloquence beyond words." [...] Francine Prose wrote in The New York Review of Books: [...] "Among the virtues of Todd Haynes's new film, Carol, is the delicacy, the patience, and the sheer amount of screen time that it lavishes on the experience of falling in love: the hesitations and doubts, the seemingly casual exchanges freighted with meaning and suppressed emotion, the simple happiness of being together." [...] Anita Katz from The San Francisco Examiner said: [...] "Haynes triumphs in his quest to make a sweeping romantic melodrama with social substance at the core. As a period piece, the movie immerses us in 1950s styles and attitudes. As a sensory experience, it dazzles <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> rain-streaked windows to Therese’s plaid tam-o-shanter ... Haynes powerfully addresses the consequences of ignorance and intolerance. Impressively textured, the drama is filled with secret glances and other subtle aspects of forbidden love." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "Carol" [...] is a performance of a performance, whereby codes and signals convey the most essential stuff of life, while the kabuki of being [...] "normal" [...] plays out with the carefully cultivated — and patently false — perfection of the toy train village Carol buys from Therese at their first meeting. Working from a carefully crafted script by Phyllis Nagy, Haynes portrays two people thirstily drinking each other in, while on the outside, they sip tea and cocktails with prim decorum." [...] Naming it [...] "one of the year's very best films", Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Camera virtuoso Edward Lachman finds visual poetry in the hothouse eroticism that envelops Carol and Therese, an amateur photographer who keeps framing Carol in her lens. Blanchett, a dream walking in Sandy Powell's frocks, delivers a master class in acting. And Mara is flawless ... Haynes' commitment to outcasts, then and now, makes Carol a romantic spellbinder that cuts deep." ...|$|E
