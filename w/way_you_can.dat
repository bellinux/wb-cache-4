500|$|In 1980, Eastwood {{directed}} {{and played the}} title role in Bronco Billy alongside Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Sam Bottoms. Eastwood has cited Bronco Billy as {{being one of the}} most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character. The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood's career, but was liked by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that film was [...] "...the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. Later that year, Eastwood starred in Any Which <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can,</b> the sequel to Every Which Way But Loose. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as [...] "funnier and even better than its predecessor". Released over the Christmas season of 1980, Any Which <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} his GCSEs, where he achieved three A grades, Primus signed a two-year apprenticeship with Charlton. He also received {{an offer from}} West Ham United, who were in a higher division, but he rejected this because he felt his first team opportunities would be greater at Charlton. Primus was playing in various positions until the club's youth team coach, Colin Clarke, decided that he should play as a centre back, [...] "I see you as a centre back, that <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see everything you want in front of you".|$|E

The reviewer noted its high system requirements and complex controls; of the latter, he said, [...] "There's no <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> play System Shock without first studying the manual {{for at least}} 20 minutes". The paper believed that the game would [...] "set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle-solving".

The reviewer noted the game's [...] "somewhat clumsy control", but said, [...] "That, however, is all I can find to complain about.

500|$|Sam Richards of NME {{described}} A Moon Shaped Pool as [...] "an {{album of}} eerie, elusive beauty that is strange, shimmering and uncertain {{all at the}} same time." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for AllMusic that [...] "there's a melancholic comfort to its ebb and flow, a gentle rocking motion that feels comforting; it's a tonic to the cloistered, scattered King of Limbs and even the sleek alienation of Kid A." [...] Pitchfork editor Jayson Greene felt the album was coloured by Yorke's separation: [...] "The impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only be after a tragedy." [...] At the end of the year, Pitchfork named [...] "Daydreaming" [...] and [...] "True Love Waits" [...] the 24th and 9th best songs of 2016 respectively.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's no <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song {{in the studio with}} Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E

500|$|... "Honesty" [...] is a piano ballad with {{synthesizer}} embellishments. It {{opens with}} [...] "sad and tender" [...] piano chords. According to Ken Bielen {{in his book}} The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that [...] "the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines [...] "Honesty is such a lonely word". Joel further sings about wearing his heart on his sleeve in [...] "Honesty". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, [...] " [...] implies that the only <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell that someone really cares about you is if they tell you you're bad." [...] "Leningrad" [...] (1989), a song from Joel's eleventh studio album Storm Front, {{has been compared to}} [...] "Honesty". According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, [...] "Honesty" [...] is a pop rock and classical rock song written in the key of B♭ major. The song is set in common time and performed in a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. Joel vocals range from the note of Bb2 to Bb4.|$|E
500|$|The 2010 TIP {{report also}} {{condemned}} Canada's {{lack of a}} national action plan, and said that Canada is a destination, source, and transit country for forced prostitution, unfree labour, the prostitution of children, {{and other forms of}} human trafficking. The report said that the federal and provincial governments of Canada were not cooperating sufficiently with respect to policing these crimes, and that a strategy for cooperation should be formulated in a national action plan. York Regional Police vice unit Detective Thai Truong agreed with the report's assessment, and said that [...] "a unified understanding and approach" [...] to human trafficking [...] "does not even exist at the municipal level of policing" [...] in Canada. Also in 2010, retired Toronto Police Service officer Dave Perry said that Canada's lack of a national action plan had resulted in the country failing to adequately deal with North Preston's Finest, a gang that engages in sex trafficking between Nova Scotia and Toronto. Perry had led a police taskforce against the gang in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said that without a national action plan, politicians lost interest in the endeavour and funding ran out. Perry stated that a plan would need to be well-funded because traffickers in Canada are making [...] "big, big money...and the only <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> combat that is with a pretty healthy budget." ...|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E

500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get away with a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood and Locke {{went on to}} star in The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Bronco Billy, Any Which <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> and Sudden Impact. According {{to former}} {{longtime}} associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several [...] "maintenance relationships" [...] (such as with Tunis) during that period. McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his [...] "habitual womanizing" [...] in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose, actress Jamie Rose (who played a bit part in Tightrope), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s) and Jacelyn Reeves, a stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves: a son Scott Eastwood (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988), whose birth certificates both said [...] "Father declined." [...] The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article {{was published in the}} Star tabloid in 1990. It quoted Reeves as saying [...] "Some family members tell me to file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to." [...] The children continued to be unacknowledged by mainstream news sources {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. Eastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time unaware of his infidelities) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for years. Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, Impulse. In court, Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a [...] "roommate" [...] before quickly redescribing her as a [...] "part-time roommate." [...] Locke's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her [...] "addiction" [...] to husband Gordon Anderson. Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to. [...] "In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation." [...] During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. [...] "I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room, and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them," [...] Locke quotes the informant. [...] "My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years of our relationship, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and having children with her. Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine." [...] As the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. She dropped her suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package which included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros., but sued him again for fraud in 1995 when she became convinced the deal with Warner was a sham, finally settling out of court in September 1996. Since then, Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood.|$|E
