5|$|Krueger {{retired to}} San Antonio, Texas, where {{he bought a}} house and wrote From Down Under to Nippon, an account of his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific. His {{retirement}} was marred by family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the army in 1947 for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. His wife's health deteriorated, and she {{died of cancer in}} 1956. His daughter Dorothy stabbed her husband to death in 1952. She <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment by a court-martial, but was freed by the Supreme Court in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} ruled that {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges. His case was remanded to the lower court for retrial. Andrew Wilson was convicted at his second trial in June 1988. But, after five days of deliberation, the jury was unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women {{were in favor of}} imposing this sentence and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom {{during a}} robbery in Salt Lake City.

Convicted of two counts of murder, Gardner <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment for the first count and received {{the death penalty for}} the second. The state adopted more stringent security measures {{as a result of the}} incident at the courthouse. While held at Utah State Prison, Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994. However, that charge was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim survived.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Wiesenthal {{dedicated}} most of {{his life}} to tracking down and gathering information on fugitive Nazi war criminals so that they could be brought to trial. In 1947 he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi war criminals. He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful.

Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, Zhou Yongkang, {{a former}} member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) and head of China's {{security}} agencies, was placed under investigation by the CCDI for abuse of power and corruption, a decision state media announced in July 2014. Zhou was the first PSC member – and the most senior-ranked official – since the founding of the People's Republic of China to be tried and convicted of corruption-related charges. Following his investigation, Zhou was expelled from the CPC. On 11 June 2015, Zhou was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state secrets by the Intermediate Court in Tianjin.

5|$|It was {{probably}} Stangl's brother-in law who informed Wiesenthal of Stangl's whereabouts in 1964. Concerned that Stangl would be warned and escape, Wiesenthal quietly prepared a dossier {{with the assistance}} of Austrian Minister of Justice Hans Klecatsky. Stangl was arrested outside his home in São Paulo on 28 February 1967 and was extradited to Germany on 22 June. A month later Wiesenthal's book The Murderers Among Us was released. Wiesenthal's publishers advertised that he had been responsible for locating over 800 Nazis, a claim that had no basis in fact but was nonetheless repeated by reputable newspapers such as the New York Times. Stangl <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> in prison and died of heart failure in June 1971, having confessed his guilt to biographer Gitta Sereny the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> in prison.|$|E
5|$|Syrgiannes was {{dissatisfied}} with the new arrangements, feeling {{that he had not}} been sufficiently rewarded for his support of Andronikos III. He also resented the greater favour shown by the young emperor to Kantakouzenos, and developed a fierce rivalry with the latter. Furthermore, chroniclers also report a story whereby Andronikos III attempted to seduce Syrgiannes's wife. In December 1321, Syrgiannes switched sides, fleeing to Constantinople. Rewarded with the lofty title of megas doux, he convinced Andronikos II to resume the war against his grandson. In July 1322, however, another agreement was reached between the two Andronikoi, which left Syrgiannes in an awkward position. His own schemes having failed, he began plotting to murder the aged Andronikos II and seize the throne for himself. The plot was foiled, however, and Syrgiannes <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|Teresa Elena De Simone (24 June 19575 December 1979) {{was murdered}} in Southampton, England, in 1979. Her murder led {{to one of the}} longest proven cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in English legal history. The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and {{was the subject of a}} three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that he could not have committed and others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment. After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could not have come from him.|$|E
5|$|The trial, {{which was}} held from 22 July to 4 October 1948, was marked by {{numerous}} irregularities. The principal {{witness for the prosecution}} was shot dead three days before the trial, and much of the evidence against the defendants was obtained through torture. All three were found guilty of conspiracy against the state and endangering national security. Although these points were raised at the trial, Ravoahangy was sentenced to death, along with Raseta and four other nationalists, while Rabemananjara <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> in prison. In July 1949, the convicts' death sentences were commuted to life in prison, and the trio remained imprisoned until they were granted amnesty in 1958. Few individuals, with the notable exception of Monja Jaona, the founder of Jiny in the south, have claimed responsibility for a leadership role in the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal {{was first}} told about Braunsteiner in early 1964 via a chance {{encounter}} in Tel Aviv {{with someone who}} had seen her performing selections at Majdanek—deciding who was to be assigned to slave labour and who was to immediately be killed in the gas chambers. When he returned to Vienna he had an operative visit one of her relatives to clandestinely collect information. Wiesenthal soon traced Braunsteiner's whereabouts to Queens, New York, so he notified the Israeli police and the New York Times. In spite of Wiesenthal's efforts to expedite the matter, Braunsteiner was not extradited to Germany until 1973. Her trial {{was part of a}} joint indictment with nine other defendants accused of killing 250,000 people at Majdanek. She <b>was</b> <b>sentenced</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment in 1981 and died in 1999.|$|E
