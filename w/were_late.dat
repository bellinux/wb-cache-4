5|$|To {{force the}} Ojibwa to comply, the {{subagent}} Watrous {{announced he would}} pay future annuities only at Sandy Lake, Minnesota instead of La Pointe, {{where they had been}} paid previously. This change resulted in the Sandy Lake Tragedy, when hundreds of Ojibwas starved or died of exposure in Minnesota and on the journey home because the promised annuity supplies <b>were</b> <b>late,</b> contaminated or inadequate.|$|E
5|$|A {{second wave}} set off from Singapore at 16:15, {{consisting}} of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos <b>were</b> <b>late</b> and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could reach them. Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this wave. Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons {{who participated in}} the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured. The returning pilots were congratulated by Air Vice-Marshal Paul Maltby, who promised them that further daylight attacks were unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Germans {{south-west}} of The Needles. The British reported 30–40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support. The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The fact remains that the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall. The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who <b>were</b> <b>late</b> in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E
5|$|Zaculeu {{was likely}} {{originally}} developed {{because of its}} proximity to the Seleguá River, providing a permanent water supply and transportation waterway, together with its easily defensible hilltop location. Zaculeu has 43 structures. The majority of construction activity took place in one burst in the Early Classic, with minor alterations thereafter. The smaller platforms situated in the plazas <b>were</b> <b>late</b> additions; they show the influence of central Mexican civilization. The entrance to the site was via a narrow land bridge to the north, which was protected by a fortified structure that occupied three-quarters of {{the width of the}} land bridge.|$|E
5|$|Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was {{supported}} by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks <b>were</b> <b>late</b> in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under artillery fire, mostly from a battery north of Bardia that was then engaged and silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only to come under machine gun and artillery fire from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under Lance Corporal F. W. Squires was sent to reconnoitre the wadi but attacked a battery position instead and returned with 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.|$|E

5|$|Group C's 9th Tabor had also, {{like the}} M-24s of Group B, {{struggled}} through the marshes {{during the first}} phase of the operation, and <b>were</b> <b>late</b> in arriving at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units' SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete.|$|E
5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals <b>were</b> <b>late</b> reacting to Kobayashi's accident and felt his own accident was unavoidable.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{hampered}} the wing's {{activities in}} January 1945. No.1 Squadron was withdrawn to Queensland to re-equip with Mosquitos, with No.13 Squadron, flying Venturas, {{taking up the}} slack on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around half of the thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No.79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut back in March, as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to Jacquinot Bay in New Britain. On 6April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos.2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join B-24 Liberators of No.82 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. The Liberators <b>were</b> <b>late</b> for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off Sumba so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the next day.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons for}} the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all {{explanations}} remain speculative.
