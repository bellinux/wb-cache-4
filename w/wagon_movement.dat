30|$|Within {{a closed}} system in North America how train path costs are {{identified}} and allocated {{to a specific}} train or <b>wagon</b> <b>movement</b> is not clear cut and is complicated by issues for example such as time available for use but not utilized. How this dead time is attributed or allocated as a cost function is also not addressed. At {{least one of the}} Class 1 railroads had until recently no clear idea as to where it was spending capital on infrastructure, how much it was spending and what the return on the investment was likely to be and how this was derived and validated. The North American position is not necessarily more developed than that in Europe (see for example, [3]) as the authors claim. Both systems have been reformed from without which speaks volumes as to the railways ability (or inability) to successfully identify and address key strategic governance and commercial issues.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} wagon–track {{model on}} curved track {{has been developed}} to characterize rail corrugation formation due to self-excitation of the wheel–rail stick–slip process. In this model, <b>wagon</b> <b>movements</b> were described using up to 78 degrees of freedom (DOFs) to model a three piece freight bogie. Innovatively, the wheelset movements are described using nine DOFs, including torsional and bending modes about the longitudinal and vertical directions. The track modelling is considered as a one-layer structure (two rail beams on discrete spring and damper elements). The wheel sliding after creepage saturation is considered in the wheel–rail interface modelling. Simulation of a case study shows that the frequencies of the wheel stick–slip process are composed of the basic frequency, which might come from the combined effect of sleeper-passing frequency and {{one third of the}} combined torsional and bending frequency of the wheelset, and the double and triple basic frequencies, which form the wavelengths of rail corrugation at different situations...|$|R
40|$|For the {{investigation}} of rail corrugation formation due to the wheel stick-slip process on curved tracks, a nonlinear wagon–track model is presented in this paper. In this model, the <b>wagon</b> <b>movements</b> were described using up to 78 degrees of freedom (Dofs). The two wheels in a wheelset are coupled through the stiffness coefficients corresponding to the natural torsional and bending modes of wheelset. The track is considered as a discretely supported distributed-parameter track modelling with one layer. In the wheel–rail interface, before the creep saturation point µsNc (μs, static wheel–rail friction coefficient; μc, normal force), the creep forces and moments are calculated using Kalker’s linear creep theory. After that point, the wheel slides on the rail and the friction force will be μkNc (µk—kinetic friction coefficient). The simulations show that the frequency of wheel stick-slip process is composed of a basic frequency, which matches the sleeper-passing frequency and the combined torsional and bending frequency of the wheelset, forming the wavelength of rail corrugation at different situations. Generally, the wheel stickslip process on the high rail oscillates at the basic frequency whilst the dominant frequency on the low rail is double the basic frequency. The effects of the curved track parameters, the wheel–rail friction characteristics and the wheel–rail profiles on the wheel stick-slip process were investigated...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Study the {{possibility}} of using geometrically-force method to determine sections of high risk of derailment in railway stations at empty <b>wagons</b> <b>movement.</b> In the test program track diagnosing subject to longitudinal forces in the freight train effecting empty wagons is provided. Methodology. To this effect empty mineral wagon and thermal cistern were equipped with strain-gauge wheel sets, strain-gauge automatic coupler and other instruments, set in the freight train weighing 4500 t. Findings. In the course of this work it was ascertained that the geometric-force ethod gives possibility to receive additional information about the track condition from the position of empty cars stability against derailment. It is shown that some sections of high risk of derailment pieces of line does not discarded by traditional ways, based on an assessment of the geometric parameters of the way. Those track sections are identified by this method, which can not be evaluated by technical means, used currently on track measurement cars. Pieces of line with low parameters on empty cars stability against derailment are individual and they are determined not only by the sizes of deviations, but their form, a combination of different types of roughness, profile and defective elements of the permanent way. Originality. Geometric-force method should be considered as complementary to the existing technology assessment of the way on the geometrical parameters; its implementation will allow revealing the track section, dangerous for the motion of empty wagons. Practical value. For the geometrically-force method realization of assessment of the way in the railway network of JSC «Russian Railways» it is proposed {{on the basis of the}} accumulated statistics and experimental data in accordance with wagons tests with a high center of gravity to develop specialized software for wagons through gauges to assess ways bygeometrically-force method that excludes the use in technology assessment of the additional freight wagon way with a strain-gauge wheel sets. ...|$|R

30|$|This {{paper has}} been {{developed}} to expose some serious shortcomings in the content and conclusions of the paper written by Clausen and Voll [4]. Their paper discusses much of the economic issues surrounding European wagonload freight services and attempts to relate this back to infrastructural and institutional differences between the US and Canada and the generalised European model. Wagonload in the European context applies to the movement of cargo in individual wagons or wagon groups between a loading point and delivery point with these single units or groups marshalled into train length formations for the longer transit. The wagon types for this are multitudinous and includes covered wagons (sometimes designated as vans) capable of carrying {{a wide variety of}} merchandise traffic. They can also be used for the movement of palletised or unitised commodities such as lumber, bagged minerals (cement). In the European context these types of vehicles can be either twin axle or four axle designs. Wagonload can also include hopper <b>wagons</b> for the <b>movement</b> of fuels, minerals, ores, timber again of varying size, weight and volumetric capability. Tanker wagons are also used in wagonload traffic to service the oil and chemical sectors. The intimation in the paper is that the North American model is inherently a more efficient and effective option without analysing much of the context that underpins the differences. It omits recent major railroad consolidations, the rapid rise of inter-modal freight, the rising importance of the regional and short line operators and growth within the US railroad sector for block trains and also a strong residual market for carload (wagonload) traffic commodities some of which move in carload blocks. The term carload in the North American context applies to those movements undertaken in separate rail vehicles which can include box cars of varying dimensions which are used primarily for higher value merchandise traffic and can be moved in single units or as blocks of vehicles to be assembled into train formations for long haul movements. Box cars {{can also be used to}} move products such as grain and lumber. Other carload traffic can include hopper wagons for minerals, agricultural products, solid fuel (Iess common now), ores and similar products, tank cars for liquids, powders, granules, pellets and gases. Again these types of rail vehicle can be moved as single units or as parts of a group of vehicles). It also appears to downplay the routing and scheduling options that exist between the Class 1 and regional railroads with short line operations to facilitate carload or carload block movements. [2], p. 1) defines that U.S. Class I Railroads are line haul freight railroads with 2010 operating revenue of $ 398.7 million or more. The AAR (American Association of Railroads, effectively an industry representative body) (2013, p. 1) reports that there are over 560 freight railroads of which only seven are “Class I” railroads that accounts for 69  % of freight rail mileage typically operating in many different states. The AAR [1] report also suggests that the non-Class I railroads, also known as short line and regional railroads, range in size from tiny operations with handling of a few carloads per month to multi-state operators not far from Class I size.|$|R
