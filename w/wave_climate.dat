40|$|The wave {{regime has}} a strong {{influence}} on the sediment transport in coastal systems. Modifications in wave regime induced by climate changes can influence the sediment dynamics of those coastal systems. To access wave regime changes {{it is crucial to}} analyse the future modifications in the wave height, period and direction. This work aims to analyse the influence of a future wave regime in the sediment budget of a coastal lagoon inlet and at the nearshore adjacent coast. To achieve this goal a morphodynamic modelling system was used, forced by present and future waves, corresponding to a typical year of present and future <b>wave</b> <b>climates.</b> A methodology to determine a typical year of each climate was developed based on the determination of correlation coefficients between each climate and corresponding year data. The comparison between present and future <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> evidences that <b>wave</b> period and height are in general similar for both climates, and confirms the anticlockwise rotation of waves in the future. The morphodynamic simulations revealed analogous results for both <b>wave</b> <b>climates,</b> resulting in similar patterns for the residual sediment fluxes, but slightly more intense in the present. The consequent bathymetric changes show that the deposition trend presently observed offshore the inlet tends to increase for future <b>waves</b> <b>climate.</b> The transport budgets were also analysed for both wave regimes, evidencing that the alongshore transport slightly decreases (~ 1 %) for future waves...|$|R
40|$|The Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH), {{with the}} {{assistance}} of Cardno (NSW/ACT) and Baird Australia, have developed the NSW Coastal Ocean Wave Model – a coupled WAVEWATCH III/SWAN modelling system that has been designed to simulate historical and potential future coastal <b>wave</b> <b>climates.</b> The purpose of the model is to investigate latitudinal and temporal variability in NSW deep-water <b>wave</b> <b>climates,</b> and alongshore variability in nearshore wave conditions. This paper describes the wave modelling facility, discusses the evaluation of model performance to date, and describes the proposed wave data products, which will be useful for assessing coastal hazard risks in NSW. Measured wave records in NSW are enviable by global standards, with Waverider buoys (WRBs) deployed along the coastline since the mid- 1970 s. However, wave modelling provides an opportunity to address some limitations of the existing measurement records, including: the sampling frequency of earlier instruments; instrument failure (particularly during storms); the relatively recent capability to measure wave directions; and deployment durations at different locations – e. g. prior to 2011, directional buoys were only deployed at Sydney (1992), Byron Bay (1999) and Batemans Bay (2001). As measurements are not available for particularly stormy periods experienced during the 1950 s, 1960 s and early 1970 s, extreme values derived from more recent data may under estimate storm-wave climates. Thus the directionality and extreme nature of NSW <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> may not be fully resolved. Simulated <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> generated by the NSW Coastal Ocean Wave Model have been evaluated against measurement records and other wave models. For example, comparison of CFSR-driven model predictions with WRB data for 1998 - 2009 suggest that predicted peak storm wave height and direction are overall very good, whilst mean wave period is typically under predicted. Although model-data agreement varies along the NSW coastline, the simulated <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> are consistent with available measurement data, and improve on existing model data. Therefore the wave model products will address some limitations of WRB records, particularly wave directions and the definition of storm peaks. 18 page(s...|$|R

Oceanographic observations of salinity and temperature as well as observations of surface-wave parameters such as the significant wave height are much scarcer than meteorological observations, making hindcasting more common in oceanography than in meteorology. Also, since surface waves represent a forced system where the wind is the only generating force, wave hindcasting is often considered adequate for generating a reasonable representation of the <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> with little need for a full reanalysis.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimum power output of a pitching-surge point absorber {{wave energy converter}} in irregular <b>wave</b> <b>climates.</b> A mathematical model based on frequency domain is used {{as the first step}} to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters of the device and its potential power output in realistic sea waves. The numerical results predict that the point absorber energy converter has the potential to absorb more energy than what is contained in its own geometrical width. The optimum power of the device is then obtained from wave tank experiments in irregular <b>wave</b> <b>climates.</b> The comparison of numerical and experimental results demonstrates that the frequency domain method based on linear theory will lead to an overestimation of the energy absorption for this device. The frequency domain method provides an upper estimate for wave energy absorption due to the non-linear, viscous effects and constrained amplitude of device oscillation.

They found that there was a need to use geoengineering to lower the Earth's average temperature and suggested adopting the principles of short <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> engineering (SWCE) to introduce aerosols into the stratosphere. Much like the sulfur particles released by large volcanic eruptions, the aerosols would reflect shortwave solar radiation back into space to cool the air and land below.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test two {{different}} numerical {{models for the}} assessment of the long <b>waves</b> <b>climate</b> inside a harbour, induced by nonlinear interaction of short waves. One model is based on the nonlinear Boussinesq Type Equations; given the properties of the incoming short waves it is able to model the growth of the long waves, and their propagation and amplification inside the harbour basin. The other model uses a simplified formula for the calculation of the incoming long waves, and solves the linearized Mild Slope Equation to reproduce the long waves penetration into the harbour. The models are applied to the harbour of Marina di Carrara (Italy), where a field measurement network of both short and long waves is operational since 2005. Short waves records are obtained by a directional buoy deployed at about 1 km offshore the harbour entrance, whereas the long waves measurements inside the basin are obtained from 8 pressure transducers installed along the harbour inner perimeter.

40|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>climate</b> {{characterization}} {{at different}} time scales (long-term historical periods, seasonal prediction, and future projections) {{is required for}} a broad number of marine activities. Wave reanalysis databases have become a valuable source of information covering time periods of decades. A weather-type approach is proposed to statistically downscale multivariate <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> over different time scales from the reanalysis long-term period. The model calibration is performed using historical data of predictor (sea level pressure) and predictand (sea-state parameters) from reanalysis databases. The storm activity responsible for the predominant swell composition of the local <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> {{is included in the}} predictor definition. N-days sea level pressure fields are used as predictor. K-means algorithm with a postorganization in a bidimensional lattice is used to obtain weather patterns. Multivariate hourly sea states are associated with each pattern. The model is applied at two locations on the east coast of the North Atlantic Ocean. The validation proves the model skill to reproduce the seasonal and interannual variability of monthly sea-state parameters. Moreover, the projection of <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> onto weather types provides a multivariate <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> characterization with a physically interpretable linkage with atmospheric forcings.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the physical coastal system determine the sustainable development of the coastal zone. One important characteristic is the <b>wave</b> <b>climate.</b> The sediment transport of both sandy and muddy particles is very much influenced by the <b>wave</b> <b>climate.</b> Therefore a sustainable coastal morphology {{has to be in}} equilibrium with the <b>wave</b> <b>climate.</b> The coastal morphology and the sedimentology are a basis for the ecosystem in the nearshore zone. Thus, indirectly the <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> has important consequences for the biology in the coastal zone. Several human activities in the coastal zone depend on the <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> as well. Evidently, to produce “green” electricity from the hydraulic energy in the sea waves can only be a success if the <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> is known (to estimate possible profits). Likewise for sporters that want to surf the waves. Waves can also be a nuisance for human activities such as shipping and handling goods in coastal harbours, for contractors carrying out coastal engineering works or workability off-shore. To determine the <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> in a coastal zone it is recommended to combine in situ measurements and wave modelling. Indeed, on the one hand to cover an area is only possible with a wave model, {{and on the other hand}} in situ measurements are needed to validate and drive a wave model. This paper presents a way to determine a <b>wave</b> <b>climate,</b> for the case of the Belgian coastal zone.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{introduction of}} renewable energy puts pressure on power producers to level peak loads, since the electrical generation from renewable sources {{more often than not}} is of intermittent nature. Good base load properties i. e. smooth and even power production over time {{is one of the most}} important characteristic a renewable source can show since that implies that less regulating power is required. This project examines the base load properties of wave power and compares them to the base load properties of wind power. This is done based on wave data from Islandsberg on the Swedish west coast and on wind and wave data recorded at Horns rev, a large wind power farm of the west coast of Jutland, Denmark. The wave energy converter (WEC) investigated is a point absorber type WEC, similar to the device developed at Uppsala University / Seabased AB. The results indicate that electrical generation from waves is less fluctuating than generation from winds. Further, wind and wave power co-production would benefit from the time delay in electric wave generation due to that the wind-generated waves continue, after the wind velocities slow down and the wind power output decreases. However, the results also show that Horns rev (and Islandsberg) have rather moderate <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> and wind-wave co-production would be better balanced inmore energetic <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> (deeper and/or more exposed waters) ...|$|R
40|$|Coastline {{modeling}} with UNIBEST: Areas {{close to}} structures In {{the world of}} coastline modeling {{there are several ways}} to predict coastline development. One of those is with the use of single line modeling software. This kind of modeling is rather basic, straight forward and fast, but it lacks some detail of different processes taking place. Processes that can have significant impact on the coastline development. This study aims at providing insight in approaches that can be used to model coastline development near structures. The focus of this study will lay on the use of UNIBEST-CL, a single line coastline modeling package, developed by Deltares. Creating a coastline model in UNIBEST-CL is rather user friendly, but if structures are present some extra work needs to be done to get reasonable output from the model. The standard approach of modeling structures in UNIBEST needs extra calculations of local <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> in the shadow zone of structures. This can be done by hand, using formulations of Kamphuis and it can also be done by using a second modeling package called SWAN. Both these methods result in a more labour intensive calculation. Therefore, a third approach is developed. An automated module is integrated in the package of UNIBEST-CL. This approach uses the same Kamphuis formulations mentioned earlier. The main difference is that it calculates the local <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> at every cross-shore ray of the UNIBEST model. Within an average model this will generate more local <b>wave</b> <b>climates</b> compared to the manual approach, resulting in more input information. To compare these three different approaches two kinds of models are created. First a theoretical study is carried out. Secondly, the results of the theoretical study are used to be verified in a field case situation. The theoretical study is based on two questions: 9 ̆ 5 How does the Automated Kamphuis approach perform compared to Manual Kamphuis calculations and SWAN calculations? 9 ̆ 5 Which modeling approach is suitable for what kind of conditions? To investigate these questions, a simple, straight coastline is created with three shore normal groynes. This configuration is tested with several changeable parameters, like different bottom profiles, wave conditions (height, period and direction) and cross shore locations of the local <b>wave</b> <b>climates.</b> After the calculations, the results are assessed by using a classification of the width of the transport zone divided by the length of the groynes. Using this classification, the results of all the runs are compared by looking at the resulting transport magnitude and the coastline shape. This leads to a final table that can be used as a recommendation on which approach to use in what kind of situation. The results of the theoretical study are used in a second calculation, to hindcast the coastline changes in a field application case at the beaches of Sitges, Spain. During the field case testing not all variants of the three approaches are used. Only one SWAN approach (50...|$|R

The foundation optimization study of the gravity-based foundation of the linear wave energy converter is based on statistical analysis of <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> data measured at the Lysekil test site.

The power absorption optimization study on the linear generator wave energy converter is based on the <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> at the Lysekil test site. A frequency-domain simplified numerical model is used with the power take-off damping coefficient chosen as the control parameter for optimizing the power absorption. The results show a large improvement with an optimized power take-off damping coefficient adjusted to the characteristics of the <b>wave</b> <b>climate</b> at the test site.
