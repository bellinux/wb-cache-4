2500|$|Clayton {{commanded}} the helicopter carrier [...] during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Ocean was the UK's lead amphibious landing ship, providing sea-based logistics to the Royal Marine's 3 Commando Brigade and {{acting as a}} launch pad for their attack on the Al-Faw Peninsula. Her helicopters {{also played a role}} in securing the city of Basra. When interviewed about the experience Clayton said; [...] "There's [...] a sense of pride in a job really well done. [...] {{played a major role in}} the operations out there. But also we have to remember that we're the lucky ones coming back. Not everyone has. There are many <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about, including one of our ship's company who was killed in action, Marine Chris Maddison. Our thoughts will be about him and with his family." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was hard}} to deal with such ravings. [...] "The thing <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of now," [...] said I, [...] "is how to get away from this island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Harvey {{brought back}} a couple at the {{beginning}} of term. Ripping little beasts. We couldn't keep them in the house, as they'd have got dropped on in a second, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of somewhere else, and thought why not keep them down here?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with OneMetal.com, lead guitarist Corey Beaulieu added,"...over time, things just kinda weren’t working out, and we did a headline tour of the US and about halfway through Travis just said he wasn’t {{going to do the}} next tour, so regardless <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about getting someone to fill in, then once we started playing with Nick we just knew it was the right thing." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{about some}} kind of design for it and what it might look like... I really did not {{want it to be}} just another ballpark. I wasn't {{interested}} in a 1970s or '80s doughnut... I wanted it to be a statement of what Miami is all about - a contemporary city. Miami is an important American city and architecture makes your city great. The idea was to create something very contemporary.|$|R

5000|$|Many of the album's {{songs were}} written {{as a direct}} {{reaction}} to the pop success of the band's previous LP East and feature unusual, experimental arrangements. Singer Barnes said, [...] "the whole band, particularly Don, decided to revolt against the pop formula when we made Circus Animals." [...] Walker said, [...] "There was no way of improving what we'd done on East, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of new things to try." [...] Barnes had noted, [...] "It's not way out, not ridiculously experimental. It's all been done before, just not by us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, [...] "You have {{mentioned}} that before, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the House more than ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} Cripps's father first. I {{think it might}} be well if we both saw him before {{deciding}} on the form of discipline. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> not only of justice but of the effect on their characters." ...|$|E
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. Everybody's used to your talk, Mr. Houghton, and {{for that}} reason it doesn't make much impression. What I meant to say, in plain words, was that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what's best for everybody, not only of ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you not conceal me here till <b>we</b> <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{what is best}} to be done?" [...] asked Branwen simply, [...] "for I {{will die}} rather than wed this-- this monster Gunrig!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had told}} my crew and {{associates}} {{in the beginning}} itself that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> like an 18-year-old as the film is about youth and their desires. So when lyricist Pa.Vijay and Rahman sat together, we wanted a catchy number which the youth can relate to. At 18, every boy dreams of having a girlfriend. Rahman {{came up with a}} perfect fast paced peppy tune and Vijayan’s lyrics fell into place as it establishes the yearning for a girlfriend. It sets the mood for the film as it appears in the first reel of Boys." ...|$|R
5000|$|The group {{moved to}} Harvard Medical School in 1959 as a sub-department within the Department of Pharmacology, headed by Otto Krayer. In 1966, Kuffler {{came up with}} the term {{neurobiology}} to unite these sub-disciplines into the first-ever Department of Neurobiology, an independent department at Harvard Medical School. Hubel later said, “I can’t be absolutely certain how the term neurobiology originated, but I believe Steve Kuffler invented it when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> up a title for our department when it was founded on 1965. That he almost single-handedly invented the field of neurobiology, I think few would dispute.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No matter! It was {{you that}} {{discovered}} the girl, {{and then something}} had to be done. I was perfectly shocked when you told me that Mr. Kendricks was in town, because I saw at once {{that he would have to}} be got in for it; and now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what we shall do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her eyes beamed tenderness. [...] "To know all, is {{to forgive}} all," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have to remind}} you of that so often! How can I help forgiving, when I know WHY you came--what spur it was that drove you? But it is the future <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of now, not the past. And I must wait and reflect. I have NO plan just at present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] said Musgrave dryly. [...] "You are an obstinate fellow, but you're in {{our hands}} now, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{what is best for}} you. To begin with, you won't be able to get about in time to be of much use, and you don't get better as fast as you ought. Then I {{understood}} you were resigned to going home before the contract is finished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a {{question}} more easily asked than answered," [...] Ned said, cheerfully. [...] "We have saved our skins for the present, now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out {{what is the best}} course to pursue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--But that, as the blighters say in books, {{is but a}} beginning, not an end. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> now <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out {{the most}} tactful way of letting the news seep through, as it were, to the mater." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{title track}} was {{conceived}} during a bus trip. Vocalist and saxophonist Paulo Miklos showed his colleagues a tape with folk music by some Xingus. Over that base, someone improvised the verses [...] "Cabeça dinossauro/Cabeça dinossauro/Cabeça, cabeça, cabeça dinossauro" [...] {{and soon the}} lyrics were all done. The percussion was performed by Liminha. After several elaborated attempts, he improvised with the walls, {{the floor and the}} pillars of the studio, and the [...] "trance" [...] performance was approved by all. The vocals of [...] "A Face do Destruidor" [...] was recorded over the base played backwards. According to Britto, [...] "when <b>we</b> recorded, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it would be listened to that way".|$|R
6000|$|Arthur {{shook his}} head sadly. [...] "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "you don't know the real gravity of the {{symptoms}} I am suffering from. I shall {{tell you all about}} them some other time. However, as you say, what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about now is Hetty. Can you let me see her? I am sure if I could see her it would reassure her and do her good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course not. No one does. It's only politics. The {{wives of}} the men who earn six and seven dollars a day--skilled labour they call it--have Chinese and Jap servants. We can't afford it. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of saving for the future, but those other people live up to every cent they earn. They know they're all right. They're Labour. They'll be looked after, {{whatever}} happens. You can see how the State looks after me.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE CAPTAIN. So {{much the}} worse! When our {{relatives}} are at home, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of all their}} good points or {{it would be impossible}} to endure them. But when they are away, we console ourselves for their absence by dwelling on their vices. That is how I have come to think my absent daughter Ariadne a perfect fiend; so do not try to ingratiate yourself here by impersonating her [he walks firmly away to the other side of the room].|$|E
5000|$|Brian Wilson {{recalls that}} {{the song was}} written {{the day of the}} assassination, in {{response}} to it: [...] When the shooting happened, everyone knew instantly. It was all over the TV and on every kind of news. I called Mike and he asked me if I wanted to write a song about it. I said sure. It seemed like something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about, and songs were the way I thought about things. We drove over to my office and in a half hour <b>we</b> <b>had</b> [...] "The Warmth of the Sun." [...] We didn't {{think of it as a}} big song. It was a personal response. But it got bigger over time because of the history linked to it.|$|R
40|$|As hospitalists, {{we often}} care for {{patients}} who either present with diarrhea or develop diarrhea during their hospital visit. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> learned <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) early.

6000|$|... "Instantly! Does {{it matter}} whether these poor French people {{are worthy of}} his generosity? If it restores his tranquillity to help them, who cares whether they deserve the help? They are not even to {{know who it is}} that assists them--Romayne is to be their unknown friend. It is he, not they, whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of--his peace of mind is everything; their merit is nothing. I say it's cruel to him to keep him in ignorance of what has happened. Why didn't you take the letter away from Major Hynd?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not he, Percival! While I {{am on the}} spot, {{and while}} that woman is in the neighbourhood, I will answer for our laying hands on her before Mr. Hartright--even if he does come back. I see! yes, yes, I see! The finding of Anne Catherick is the first necessity--make your mind easy about the rest. Your wife is here, under your thumb--Miss Halcombe is inseparable from her, and is, therefore, under your thumb also--and Mr. Hartright {{is out of the}} country. This {{invisible}} Anne of yours is all <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of for the present. You have made your inquiries?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This is one {{of those}} very deep texts which we are not meant to think about every day; only at such seasons as this, when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Christ {{ascending}} into heaven, that he might send down his Spirit at Whitsuntide. Of this the text speaks; and therefore, we may, I hope, think a little of it to-day, but reverently, and cautiously, like men who know a very little, and are afraid of saying more than they know. These deep mysteries about heaven we must always meddle with very humbly, lest we get out of our depth in haste and self- conceit. As it is said, ...|$|E
2500|$|IMF's new South-Asia {{director}} Mr. George Abed, {{said he was}} [...] "very {{pleased with}} the record of Pakistan {{in the past three}} years of continued macroeconomic and financial stabilisation and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> begun <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Pakistan as a country of promise and a country of potentially high rate of growth".|$|R
5000|$|We {{no longer}} believe that God causes {{earthquakes}} and crop failures and plagues when He gets mad at us. We no longer imagine that He can be cooled off by sacrifices and festivals and gifts. I am so glad <b>we</b> don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> up presents for Him anymore.
