5|$|Concentrating {{solar plants}} in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use, because concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems have high water-consumption intensities {{compared}} to other types of electric power plants; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210). A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidance}} {{issued by}} the UK government's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) now recommends that microbiological monitoring for <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> systems, using a dipslide, should be performed weekly. The guidance now also recommends that routine testing for legionella bacteria in <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> systems be carried out at least quarterly, and more frequently when a system is being commissioned, or if the bacteria have been identified on a previous occasion.|$|E
25|$|When <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> towers with {{seawater}} make-up {{are installed}} in various industries located {{in or near}} coastal areas, the drift of fine droplets emitted from the cooling towers contain nearly 6% sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas. This deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture/vegetative lands can convert them into sodic saline or sodic alkaline soils depending {{on the nature of}} the soil and enhance the sodicity of ground and surface water. The salt deposition problem from such cooling towers aggravates where national pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> towers using seawater make-up.|$|E

50|$|The species {{occurs in}} a wide range of {{habitats}}, from open forests, scrubland, downs, gardens and parkland to shrub-rich open country. The habitats can be dry or <b>wet,</b> <b>cool</b> or warm.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{found in}} <b>wet</b> <b>cool</b> forest from 500-1000m in wet season, up to 3000m in early dry season and {{occasionally}} seen down to sea level. Small flocks, mostly family groups under 6 birds.|$|R
25|$|Respirable {{suspended}} particulate matter, {{of less than}} 10 micrometers (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5µm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the total emissions from <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000ppm).|$|E
25|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> towers used in {{coal-fired}} power stations, etc. emit drift and fog {{which are also}} an environmental concern. The drift contains Respirable suspended particulate matter. In case of cooling towers with sea water makeup, sodium salts are deposited on nearby lands which would convert the land into alkali soil, reducing the fertility of vegetative lands and also cause corrosion of nearby structures.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> tower (or {{open circuit}} cooling tower), {{the warm water}} can be cooled to a {{temperature}} lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see dew point and psychrometrics). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, {{a small portion of}} the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature, which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.|$|E

50|$|Live Oak's climate usually {{consists}} of hot, dry summers and prolonging <b>wet,</b> <b>cool</b> winters, a Mediterranean climate. Summers are hot, sunny and dry but a delta breeze occurs at times. This cools the temperature but doesn't last long. Heat waves occur {{during the summer}} months, lasting for 3-5 days on average. Temperatures range from 105 to 110 degrees. Dry months range from mid to late May to early to mid September where rainfall is rare. The hottest month is July with temperatures averaging around 96 to 100 degrees with no rain but it isn't rare for some rain to arrive from the Southwest Monsoon. Winters are prolonging <b>wet,</b> <b>cool</b> and foggy. <b>Wet</b> months range from mid October to mid April where rainfall becomes constant. January is the <b>wettest</b> and <b>coolest</b> month with rainfall averaging between 4 and 6 inches but during El Niño season, rainfall averages 10 to 12 inches which causes major flooding. During the La Niña season, rainfall averages 4 inches or below, causing drought problems during summer. In the winter, temperatures average 45 to 50 degrees. Foggy and cloudy weather can last up to 2 to 4 weeks, also known as Tule fog. Snow occurs rarely. The record amount of snow was 3.8 inches in 2002.|$|R
