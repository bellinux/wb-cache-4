5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only pay for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, viewing tools potentiates motor {{activity}} {{related to the}} specific tool-use. This phenomenon is different from other classes of objects, and indicates that tools are not viewed just based off what they are, but also <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> do. In just viewing tools, activation of left lateralized areas {{are very similar to}} the use/pantomiming areas as noted above. These areas include the ventral premotor cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and some parietal areas. The main difference is that tools being used elicit greater activation in ventral brain regions, and decreased activation in primary motor areas. Additionally, there were very similar areas of activation in naming tools and viewing tools. There were other areas of activation in the left hemisphere, possibly reflecting the lateralization of language.|$|E

25|$|In any case, no {{evidence}} has ever proven {{the existence of}} Fräulein Sprengel or her Lodge. (By Westcott's account, {{the other members of}} the German order supposedly objected to Sprengel's chartering of the Isis-Urania Lodge, and all further communications were cut off after she died.) The Isis-Urania Charter was written and signed only by Westcott, Mathers and William Robert Woodman. There are letters by Mackenzie that indicate the 'Society of Eight' existed, but nothing that describes <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> taught or practiced. The symbolism and philosophy contained in the Cipher Manuscripts are not very different from that of high-degree Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, and Mackenzie and the members of the S.R.I.A. were capable-enough esoteric scholars, with access to works on the Qabalah, Hermeticism, and Egyptology in Masonic libraries, to have combined it all into the form followed by the Golden Dawn.|$|E

Eichelberger became convinced that America's objectives in Siberia were not necessarily the same as those of her French and British allies, but it was far from clear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> were, especially when the State Department and the War Department did not always agree.

2500|$|A {{number of}} Muslim {{countries}} try to overcome {{some of these}} difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months.

2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] (2005), Malcolm Gladwell relates his conversations with market {{researchers}} in the food industry who put most {{of the blame for}} the failure of New Coke on the flawed nature of taste tests. They claim most are subject to systematic biases. Tests such as the Pepsi Challenge were [...] "sip tests", meaning that drinkers were given small samples (less than a can or bottle's worth) to try. Gladwell contends that what people say they like in these tests may not reflect <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> buy to drink at home over several days. Carol Dollard, who once worked in product development for Pepsi, told Gladwell: [...] "I've seen many times where the sip test will give you one result and the home-use test will give you the exact opposite." [...] For example, although many consumers react positively to the sweeter taste of Pepsi in small volumes, it may become unattractively sweet when drunk in quantity. Coke, on the other hand, may be more attractive for drinking in volume, because it is less sweet. A more comprehensive testing regimen could possibly have revealed this, Gladwell's sources believe.|$|E

2500|$|Citizens {{and governments}} have been {{concerned}} with misuse of social networking services by children and teenagers, in particular in relation to online sexual predators. For instance, there is a study which suggests the children are {{not too far from}} inappropriate content on YouTube. Overuse of social networking may also make children more susceptible to depression and anxiety. Governments are taking action to better understand the problem and find some solutions. A 2008 panel concluded that technological fixes such as age verification and scans are relatively ineffective means of apprehending online predators. In May 2010, a child pornography social networking site with hundreds of members was dismantled by law enforcement. It was deemed [...] "the largest crimes against children case brought anywhere by anyone". Girls in particular are also known to be at more of a risk online using social networks than boys. According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through [...] "products of play" [...] in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> appear which can attract sexual predators. Many parents of teenage girls worry about their safety online because of the many manipulations there are online and on social networking sites.|$|E
2500|$|Clark {{largely ignored}} the 20th century historiographic preoccupation with {{economic}} and social history, and completely rejected the Marxist stress on class and class struggle as {{the driving force of}} social progress. He was also not much interested in detailed factual history, and as the History progressed it became less and less based in empirical research and more and more a work of literature: an epic rather than a history. His inattention to factual detail became notorious, and was noted even in the first volume, which drew a critical review from Malcolm Ellis titled [...] "History without facts". Ellis, who had a history of personal hostility with Clark, was the first of many critics who took Clark to task for too much speculation about what was in the hearts of men and too little description of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> did. The historian A. G. L. Shaw, who had been best man at Clark's wedding, said that while most of Clark's errors were trivial, together they created [...] "a sense of mistrust in the work as a whole". There was also criticism that Clark relied too heavily on his own interpretation of primary sources and ignored the secondary literature. On the other hand, many historians, including Max Crawford, Bede Nairn, Kathleen Fitzpatrick and Allan W. Martin the official biographer of Robert Menzies, praised the book.|$|E
