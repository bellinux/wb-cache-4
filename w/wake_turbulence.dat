5|$|That night, as Jack and Kate {{decide to}} search for the plane cockpit as its {{transceiver}} would allow the survivors to send a distress signal, loud roaring noises and crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie disappears into the bathroom while Jack and Kate awaken the concussed pilot (Greg Grunberg) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for Fiji and hit <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence.</b> After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises heard on the beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.|$|E

In 1992, In-N-Out opened its first non-Southern California restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada. Its first Northern California location was opened the following year in Modesto. Expansion then spread to Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area, while additional Las Vegas-area restaurants were added. However, after opening the 83rd In-N-Out restaurant in Fresno, California, on December 15, 1993, Rich Snyder and four other passengers {{died in a plane}} crash on approach to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California. The charter aircraft they were on had been following a Boeing 757 in for landing, became caught in its <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence,</b> and crashed.

25|$|Data {{from the}} flight data {{recorder}} (FDR) showed that the events leading into the crash began at 9:15:36, when the aircraft hit <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence</b> from the JAL flight {{just in front of}} it. The first officer attempted to stabilize the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs from left to right. This continued for at least 20seconds, until 9:15:56, when the stress of the first officer's repeated rudder movements caused the lugs that attached the vertical stabilizer and rudder to fail. The stabilizer separated from the aircraft and fell into Jamaica Bay, about one mile north of the main wreckage site. Eight seconds later, the stall warning sounded on the cockpit voice recorder.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the FAA and other U.S. {{government}} agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), began studying the 757's <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence</b> characteristics. This followed several incidents, including two fatal crashes, in which small private aircraft experienced {{loss of control}} when flying close behind the twinjet. Smaller airliners had also suffered unexpected rolling movements when flying behind 757s. Investigators focused on the aircraft's aft-loaded wing design, which at certain points during takeoff or landing could produce wingtip vortices that were stronger than those emanating from larger 767s and 747s. Other tests were inconclusive, leading to debate among government agencies, and in 1994 and 1996 the FAA updated air traffic control regulations to require greater separation behind the 757 than other large-category jets. The 757 became the only sub- airliner to be classified as a [...] "heavy" [...] jet, alongside wide-body aircraft, under FAA separation rules.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the accident, one commentator stated that the loss of so many top level Northern Ireland intelligence officers in one stroke was a huge blow to the John Major government, [...] "temporarily confounding" [...] its campaign against the IRA.

2500|$|The {{dome and}} swirler are {{the part of}} the {{combustor}} that the primary air (see Air flow paths below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use bluff body domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence</b> to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} debate about animals’ {{contribution}} to ocean circulation, called biomixing, or biogenic mixing. The energy input of schooling fish is significant but the eddies {{may be too}} small; so energy is dissipated as heat before impacting oceanic structure. I suggest that high turbulence caused by some very large aggregations of small animals has an important impact via a more direct ecosystem feedback process than overall ocean circulation. In the model presented here, large schools exhibit cooperative behavior and act like giant sieves grading zooplankton through individual swimmer’s wakes, which focus the best prey in predictable positions. Following schoolers exploit these patterns. Then schools leave, in their <b>wakes,</b> chaotic <b>turbulence</b> enhancing growth of the smaller zooplankton and phytoplankton which has been graded out by the school. The result is a different community structure of plankton than would exist without such biomixing.

2500|$|The A300-600 {{took off}} {{immediately}} after a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 {{on the same}} runway. It flew into the larger jet's wake, an area of turbulent air. The first officer attempted to stabilize the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs. The force of the air flowing against the moving rudder stressed the aircraft's vertical stabilizer, and eventually snapped it off entirely, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the enormous stress on the rudder {{was due to the}} first officer's [...] "unnecessary and excessive" [...] rudder inputs, and not the <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence</b> caused by the 747. The NTSB further stated [...] "if the first officer had stopped making additional inputs, the aircraft would have stabilized".

2500|$|Airbus {{charged that}} the crash was mostly American Airlines' fault arguing that the airline did not train its pilots {{properly}} about {{the characteristics of the}} rudder. Aircraft tail fins are designed to withstand full rudder deflection in one direction when below maneuvering speed, but this does not guarantee that they can withstand an abrupt shift in rudder from one direction to the other. The NTSB indicated that American Airlines' Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program (AAMP) tended to exaggerate the effects of <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence</b> on large aircraft. Therefore, pilots were being trained to react more aggressively than was necessary. According to author Amy Fraher, this led to concerns of whether it was appropriate for the AAMP to be placing such importance on [...] "the role of flight simulators in teaching airplane upset recovery at all."

2500|$|Both the CVR and FDR were {{recovered}} {{and used for}} the investigation. Due to the limited parameters recorded by the FDR, investigators did {{not have access to}} the position of the flight-control surfaces (rudder, ailerons, elevator, etc.) for the accident. However, two parameters recorded by the FDR were crucial, one being the aircraft's heading, the other being the pitch control yoke position. During the approach, Flight 427 encountered <b>wake</b> <b>turbulence</b> from Delta 1083; the FAA, however, determined [...] "the wake vortex encounter alone would not have caused the continued heading change that occurred after 1903:00." [...] The abrupt heading change shortly before the dive pointed investigators immediately to the rudder. Due to the absence of rudder pedal positions from the data, investigators had to determine whether the rudder moved hard-over by a malfunction or by pilot command. This in turn led to the CVR being more heavily scrutinized than most other recordings as statements and breathing from the pilots could potentially tell investigators if they were fighting for control over a rudder malfunction or inadvertently stomped on the wrong rudder pedal in excitement from the wake-turbulence. Boeing felt the latter more likely, while USAir and the Pilot's Union felt the former was more likely.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{validate}} a wind farm LES framework {{in the context of}} two distinct wake redirection techniques: yaw misalignment and individual cyclic pitch control. A test campaign was conducted using scaled wind turbine models in a boundary layer wind tunnel, where both particle image velocimetry and hot-wire thermo anemometers were used to obtain high quality measurements of the downstream flow. A LiDAR system was also employed to determine the non-uniformity of the inflow velocity field. A high-fidelity large-eddy simulation lifting-line model was used to simulate the aerodynamic behavior of the system, including the geometry of the wind turbine nacelle and tower.

Besides the standard momentum and continuity equations from the boundary layer theory in two dimensions, an additional equation for the conservation of angular momentum is introduced to study axisymmetric swirl effects on <b>wake</b> growth. <b>Turbulence</b> is simulated with two options: the standard k-ε model and the Reynolds Stress transport model. A finite volume method is used to discretize the governing equations for mean flow and turbulence quantities. A marching algorithm of expanding grids is employed to enclose the growing far-wake and to solve the equations implicitly at every axial step. Axisymmetric far-wakes with/without swirl are studied at different Reynolds numbers and swirl numbers.
