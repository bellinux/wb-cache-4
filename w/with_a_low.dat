5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> TSH).|$|E
5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> melting point of 304°C.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an update {{of an earlier}} supply analysis, He, et al., (2013), of {{low-temperature}} utilization of geothermal resources using geothermal district heating and cooling systems. Along {{with the use of}} identified hydrothermal resources, it updates the supply curve for direct-use utilization using undiscovered hydrothermal resources and near-hydrothermal EGS resources. It also incorporates an improved design of the heating system, so that the energy production of the system matches the continuously changing energy demand due to changes in the ambient temperature. Due to uncertainties in characterizing the geothermal reservoir and the related costs, Monte Carlo simulations are used for both the estimates of thermal potential and levelized cost. The thermal potential of identified hydrothermal resources is identified <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mean of 72, 577 MWth, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lowest</b> cost at $ 6. 74 /MMBtu, while that of the undiscovered hydrothermal resources has a mean of 240, 860 MWth, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lowest</b> cost at $ 7. 25 /MMBtu. The thermal potential of near-hydrothermal EGS has a mean of 41, 035 MWth, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lowest</b> cost at $ 7. 87 /MMBtu. At last, sensitivity analyses are conducted to target the metrics with the most effective influence in decreasing the levelized cost of such applications. 1...|$|R
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
