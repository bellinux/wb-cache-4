50|$|Though {{the family}} {{includes}} three genera of blind, subterranean, and troglobitic catfishes, Trogloglanis, Satan, and Prietella, {{none of these}} three genera <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> related. Instead, Satan <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> related to Pylodictis, Prietella to Noturus, and Trogloglanis possibly to Ictalurus, although it may not <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related {{to any of the}} other ictalurids. Ameiurus is sister to a clade formed by Satan, Pylodictis, Noturus, and Prietella.|$|R
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|An {{influential}} group {{assembled in}} Britain {{to lobby for}} his release from prison. Headed by Lord Hankey, the group included politicians Lord de L'Isle and Richard Stokes, Field Marshal Alexander and Admiral of the Fleet The Earl of Cork and Orrery, and military historians Basil Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller. Upon re-gaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> associated with the group, gave priority to the quick release of the war criminals remaining in British custody.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{concluded}} {{an alliance}} with Gumushtekin, atabeg of Aleppo, against Saladin, the Ayyubid ruler of Egypt and Syria, in May 1176. On Bohemond's demand, Gumushtekin released his Christian prisoners, including Bohemond's stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon. To strengthen his alliance with the Byzantine Empire, in 1177 Bohemond married Theodora, who <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> related to Emperor Manuel.|$|E

5|$|Bute <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which {{he argued that the}} language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming able to read the texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the popular media, and the comet <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus is {{currently}} {{classified as a}} hadrosaurid, in the subfamily Lambeosaurinae. It is related to other hadrosaurs such as Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus and Olorotitan, {{with the exception of}} Olorotitan they all share similar looking skulls and crests. However, research published in 2003 has suggested that even though it possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, and said that they formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} years of World WarII, Australia's {{military}} strategy <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> aligned with that of the United Kingdom. In line with this, most Australian military units deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed {{a key part of the}} Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions sent to the Middle East saw extensive action, as did the RAAF squadrons and warships in this theatre.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th century onwards, Royton's economy <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> {{tied with}} that of Britain's textile {{manufacture}} during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the cotton spinning sector. However, Royton also lies on the Oldham Coalfield, and coal mining had an economic role for the area in {{as early as the}} 17th century. Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200collieries in the town. Royton's pits were prone to repeated flooding, and owners began to close them. Coal production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry, with the last pit closing in 1902.|$|E

5|$|He {{decided to}} set the series in a fictional town of Dillon, Texas, with some {{characteristics}} of Odessa. The football team was given the Panthers name. Berg deliberately carried elements from the film to the series, particularly for the pilot, which <b>was</b> <b>closely</b> related to the film. He cast Connie Britton as the wife of head coach Eric Taylor, and Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity, a major businessman and football booster, in roles similar to those they played in the film.|$|E
