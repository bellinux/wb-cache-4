25|$|During Reconstruction, New Orleans {{was within}} the Fifth Military District of the United States. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868, and its Constitution of 1868 granted {{universal}} manhood suffrage. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, then-lieutenant governor P.B.S. Pinchback succeeded Henry Clay <b>Warmouth</b> as governor of Louisiana, becoming the first non-white governor of a U.S. state, and the last African American to lead a U.S. state until Douglas Wilder's election in Virginia, 117 years later. In New Orleans, Reconstruction was marked by the Mechanics Institute race riot (1866). The city operated successfully a racially integrated public school system. Damage to levees and cities along the Mississippi River adversely affected southern crops and trade for the port city for some time, as the government tried to restore infrastructure. The nationwide Panic of 1873 also slowed economic recovery.|$|E
2500|$|Violence {{throughout}} the South, especially the Memphis Riots of 1866 {{followed by the}} New Orleans Riot in July of that year, led Congress to passi the Reconstruction Act and the Fourteenth Amendment, extending the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color. Louisiana and Texas were put {{under the authority of}} the"Fifth Military Distric" [...] of the United States during Reconstruction. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868; its Constitution of 1868 granted universal male suffrage and established universal public education. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, lieutenant governor P.B.S. Pinchback, who was of mixed race, succeeded Henry Clay <b>Warmouth</b> for a brief period as Republican governor of Louisiana, becoming the first governor of African descent of an American state. (The next African American to serve as governor of an American state was Douglas Wilder, elected in Virginia in 1989.) New Orleans operated a racially-integrated public school system during this period.|$|E
2500|$|Lake of the Woods was stocked for {{the first}} time in 1913. [...] This {{introduced}} hatchery-breed rainbow trout into the lake. [...] This stocking produced a decade of good trout fishing. [...] In 1922, the Oregon State Game Commission (a predecessor to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife) stocked the lake with largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, <b>warmouth,</b> pumpkinseed sunfish, [...] brown bullheads, carp, and perhaps suckers. [...] The yellow perch quickly became the lake's dominant species, out-competing the trout for both food and habitat. [...] Between 1925 and 1935, brook trout, cutthroat trout, chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead were also introduced into the lake. [...] No additional rainbow trout were stocked until 1946. [...] The trout population remained relatively stable until about 1938 when the salmonid populations began to decline, probably due to competition from the warm water species combined with limited spawning areas and increasing fishing. [...] Despite the Game Commission's efforts to control the warm water species, their population continued to proliferate while the salmonid species declined. [...] In 1955, the entire lake was poisoned with rotenone, killing all the fish in the lake. [...] The lake was then restocked with rainbow trout, brook trout, and kokanee salmon.|$|E
60|$|His {{boat was}} just in. I {{had been waiting}} several days for her, purposing to return to St. Louis in her. The captain and I joined a party of ladies and gentlemen, guests of Major Wood, and went down the river fifty-four miles, in a swift tug, to ex-Governor <b>Warmouth's</b> sugar plantation. Strung along below the city, {{were a number of}} decayed, ram-shackly, superannuated old steamboats, not one of which had I ever seen before. They had all been built, and worn out, and thrown aside, since I was here last. This gives one a realizing sense of the frailness of a Mississippi boat and the briefness of its life.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The {{importance}} of floodplain lakes to tropical river systems is well established, but {{little is known}} about the function of these habitats in temperate river systems. We examined fish diversity, abundance, and reproduction within six oxbow lakes of the Kaskaskia River, Illinois, over 5 years and their relationship to 11 abiotic environmental variables. The lakes were hydrologically dynamic within and among years, varying in the time connected with the main stem (0 – 22 weeks/year) and the frequency of low (, 0. 3 -m) water (0 – 23 weeks/year). Differences were found both among years and lakes. All measured limnological variables (dissolved oxygen, Secchi disk depth, conductivity, and temperature) varied temporally, but only conductivity and Secchi disk depth varied among lakes. Fish species differed among lakes and between adjacent lotic habitats, and species-specific abundance varied among years, seasons, and lakes. This variation was related to several environmental variables. Diversity was positively related to the distance between the oxbow lake and the river but not to any variables that had interannual variation. Seine catch per unit effort (CPUE) was negatively related to mean water level and Secchi disk depth. Total electrofishing CPUE was not related to any variables; however, that of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus was positively related to maximum depth and that of <b>warmouths</b> L. gulosus was positively related to vegetated area. Across all lakes, evidence of reproduction was found for five species and was negatively related to the mean water level and frequency o...|$|R
60|$|The <b>Warmouth</b> {{plantation}} {{covers a}} vast deal of ground, and the hospitality of the <b>Warmouth</b> mansion is graduated {{to the same}} large scale. We saw steam-plows at work, here, for the first time. The traction engine travels about on its own wheels, till it reaches the required spot; then it stands still and {{by means of a}} wire rope pulls the huge plow toward itself two or three hundred yards across the field, between the rows of cane. The thing cuts down into the black mold {{a foot and a half}} deep. The plow looks like a fore-and-aft brace of a Hudson river steamer, inverted. When the negro steersman sits on one end of it, that end tilts down near the ground, while the other sticks up high in air. This great see-saw goes rolling and pitching like a ship at sea, and it is not every circus rider that could stay on it.|$|E
50|$|The <b>warmouth,</b> <b>warmouth</b> sunfish, or <b>warmouth</b> bass, (Lepomis gulosus), {{is a large}} sunfish found {{throughout}} the eastern United States. Other local names include molly, redeye, goggle-eye, red-eyed bream, stump knocker, and strawberry perch. Despite a passing, superficial similarity in appearance, the <b>warmouth</b> {{should not be confused}} with its distant relative the rock bass.|$|E
50|$|The <b>warmouth</b> is an {{extremely}} adaptable species that can survive in many different conditions, in many river systems east of the Rocky Mountains. Often, the <b>warmouth</b> prefers habitats where slower-moving and often polluted water. The {{most common cause of}} concern for the <b>warmouth</b> is hybridization with other Lepomis spp. that often inhabit the same areas as the <b>warmouth.</b> The species known to hybridize with it are L. cyanellus and L. macrochirus, as well as largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus. This does not seem to affect the overall health or longevity of the species.|$|E
5000|$|The primary diet of the <b>warmouth</b> {{consists}} of insects, crayfish, and other fish. They are sight feeders, and can survive in polluted, low-oxygenated waters where other sunfish cannot, like rock bass. The largest factor affecting <b>warmouth</b> density and biomass in Florida’s lakes is {{the availability of}} aquatic macrophytes, which allows the fish to ambush prey and use as areas to spawn. [...] The primary diet of young <b>warmouth</b> is microcrustaceans and aquatic insect lava, whereas larger specimens tend to mainly consume crayfish, freshwater shrimp, and other small fish. Their predators include larger fish, snakes, turtles, alligators, and birds. The primary habitats the <b>warmouth</b> occupies are areas with ample vegetation as cover with slower-moving water, often around stumps, brush piles, and other dense entanglements that allow the <b>warmouth</b> the ability to ambush prey, yet escape larger predators that may threaten them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Warmouth</b> or Walleye {{have not}} been seen in this lake for years.|$|E
50|$|Support for <b>Warmouth</b> {{among black}} Louisiana Republican's flagged, and {{opposition}} to <b>Warmouth</b> coalesced in {{what was called the}} Custom House Ring as it was headquartered at the U. S. Custom House and was led by federal appointees, including Lewis, Stephen B. Packard, a US Marshal, and James F. Casey, Collector of the Port of New Orleans and brother-in-law to President Ulysses S. Grant. The Custom House Ring supported the gubernatorial bid of Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives George W. Carter, and Carter and <b>Warmouth</b> violently clashed in late 1871 and early 1872. James Longstreet {{was the head of the}} Louisiana state militia, and was called to defend the statehouse from an attempt by Carter and the Ring to take over the government. Lewis did not respond to Longstreet's call of the militia, although members of his unit were reorganized under more politically reliable officers and did play a role in supporting <b>Warmouth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lepomis kansasensis lived 6.6 {{million years}} ago, and had pterygoid teeth, {{indicating}} {{a close relationship}} to the <b>warmouth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Spawning for the <b>warmouth</b> begins usually {{begins when}} water {{temperatures}} reach 21.1 °C. Their spawning often begins in May and lasts until July. Nests are primarily constructed on rock or gravel substrates, usually located {{in or near}} to some type of structure in the water column. Unlike most other Lepomis species, the <b>warmouth</b> does not nest in a colony unless ideal nesting habitat is limited. When in breeding condition, the males' eyes turn red. After the female lays her eggs, the male fertilizes the eggs and aggressively defends the nest, eggs and fry from any intruder-including other females. Males are most commonly found defending the nest {{for up to five}} days later until the fry have hatched. Young <b>warmouth</b> {{spend most of their time}} hiding under benthic substrate available to avoid predators. Most are considered sexually mature after one year, but often the size of a fish indicates its maturity rather than time. Males usually grow faster than females. Different habitat conditions also reflect the lifespan of the <b>warmouth,</b> which varies from three to eight years.|$|E

50|$|Smallmouth, largemouth, rock bass, {{and spotted}} bass {{as well as}} <b>warmouth,</b> longear, green sunfish, bluegills, channel catfish, and crappie inhabit the river.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>warmouth</b> is dark, with a mottled brown coloration. Its belly is {{generally}} golden, {{and the male}} has a bright-orange spot {{at the base of}} the dorsal fin. Three to five reddish-brown streaks radiate from the eyes, and the gill flaps are often red. It has three spines in the anal fin, 10 spines in the dorsal fin, and small teeth are present on the tongue. These fish range in size from 4 to 10 inches (10.2 to 25 cm), but can grow to over 12 inches (31 cm) in length, and weigh up to 2.25 pounds (1 kg). The <b>warmouth</b> is occasionally confused with the rock bass or green sunfish, both of which share its relatively large mouth and heavy body. However, the green sunfish generally has a greenish-blue variegated pattern on its gill flaps, a black spot near the base of the dorsal fin, and its fins are bordered in yellowish-white. The rock bass has 5-7 spines in its anal fin as opposed to the three in the <b>warmouth.</b> The <b>warmouth</b> tends to be a bit larger in size than either of the other two species.|$|E
50|$|Fish are abundant. Freshwater species include bass, bream, catfish, crappie, <b>warmouth,</b> drum, and garfish. Inland {{saltwater}} fish, {{found in}} the saltwater marches include redfish, speckled trout and flounder.|$|E
50|$|Fishing is {{permitted}} year-round {{on the lake}} in accordance with Georgia State fishing laws. Sportfish most caught include largemouth bass, chain pickerel, crappie, bluegill, <b>warmouth</b> perch, flier, and catfish.|$|E
50|$|Since warmouths are not migratory fish, {{their populations}} should be {{relatively}} easily monitored {{throughout much of}} their existing ranges. According to Warren, there is no threat or current concern for the <b>warmouth.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Warmouth</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} much of the south in the Mississippi River drainage, from the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and northward to the Chesapeake Bay, and westward throughout Texas to the Rio Grande, and northward into the Great Lakes basin area. The <b>warmouth</b> is a highly aggressive and hardy fish, and they can live in ponds, lakes, rivers, and backwater streams and can often survive in streams with low oxygen levels where other species of sunfish cannot. The species exists with breeding populations in southern portions of Canada, and likely has existed there for many years prior to being detected.|$|E
5000|$|Lepomis serratus {{is known}} from 3.4 to 2.0 million year old {{deposits}} in Nebraska, and {{also appears to}} be closely related to or ancestral to the <b>warmouth</b> {{on the basis of its}} preopercle.|$|E
50|$|There are {{no public}} {{swimming}} areas or boat ramps on the lake's shore. However, since it borders Lake Streety Road, public fishing there is possible. The HookandBullet.Com website says the lake contains bullhead, crappie and <b>warmouth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Two {{other more}} recent fossil species {{appear to be}} closely allied to Lepomis gulosus, and indeed their {{earliest}} occurrence may {{be close to the}} divergence of the lineage leading to the modern <b>warmouth</b> from other species of Lepomis: ...|$|E
50|$|Lake Letta has public boat ramp on {{its north}} side, just off Highway 17. Fishing is allowed; one posting on the Hook and Bullet website says the lake has sturgeon, <b>warmouth</b> and blue catfish. However, this lake has no public {{swimming}} areas.|$|E
50|$|While {{lacking the}} broad range of {{recreational}} activity available in other national forests, St. Francis National Forest is known for its fishing. The two largest lakes, Bear Creek Reservoir and Storm Creek Lake, enjoy large populations of Largemouth bass, Crappie, <b>Warmouth,</b> and Channel catfish.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} are {{or have been}} resident fishes of Strike Reservoir: Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bridgelip Sucker, Brown Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Chiselmouth, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, Largescale Sucker, Mottled Sculpin, Mountain Whitefish, Northern Pikeminnow, Peamouth, Pumpkinseed, Rainbow Trout, Redside Shiner, Smallmouth Bass, <b>Warmouth,</b> White Crappie, White Sturgeon (Snake River Population), Whitefish (Var. Sp. Prosopium), and Yellow Perch.|$|E
50|$|The bantam sunfish has {{no known}} predators. Many predatory fish coexist in the habitat of bantam sunfish; however, {{predation}} {{has not been}} documented in literature reports. One extensive study at Wolf Lake, Illinois {{found no evidence of}} predation on the bantam sunfish. Gut analysis of potential predators, including largemouth bass, black crappie, white crappie, <b>warmouth,</b> bluegill, and yellow bullhead revealed a lack of predation on bantam sunfish.|$|E
50|$|The Wacissa is {{well known}} for its large {{concentration}} of aquatic birds, including egrets, herons, ibis, osprey, wood storks, limpkins, anhingas, kingfishers, barred owls and bald eagles. Aquatic animals are also abundant, including alligators, river otters, turtles, water snakes, and crayfish. The main species of fish are bass, mullet, catfish, red-breasted sunfish, stumpknocker and gar, although the <b>warmouth</b> perch, speckled perch, flier bream, and shellcracker may also found in the Wacissa.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} also very fishable. A large number of species inhabit the river, among them: sunfishes (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass bluegill, crappie, pumpkinseed, and <b>warmouth),</b> bowfin, brown bullhead, minnows (common carp, chub, dace, and shiner), suckers (white sucker and redhorse), perches (yellow perch, walleye, darter), brook stickleback, {{northern}} pike, longnose gar, trout (brown trout, brook trout, and rainbow trout), and lampreys (American brook lamprey and chestnut lamprey).|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} {{males are}} aggressive and territorial. Females are sexually mature at {{one year of}} age and spawn in May through July, probably producing multiple clutches. The yellow-orange eggs are up to 1.2 millimeters wide and are adhesive on the substrate. Spawning activity has not been observed in nature. This species sometimes shares nesting sites with sunfishes such as the <b>warmouth</b> (Lepomis gulosus). The male minnow may defend the nest site.|$|E

5000|$|Shanty Hollow Lake is a 135 acre {{reservoir}} {{mostly in}} Warren County, Kentucky, but also extending into Edmonson County. It {{was constructed in}} 1951. [...] The lake is located approximately 17 mi north of Bowling Green and is used for fishing. Fish which may be taken from the lake include largemouth bass, bluegill, redear sunfish, black crappie, white crappie, <b>warmouth,</b> channel catfish, and common carp. [...] Shanty Hollow Lake is a man-made lake, created by the damming of Clay Lick Creek.|$|E
50|$|In the 1890s {{and early}} 1900s, Lewis and Walter L. Cohen {{were the most}} {{important}} political allies of Booker T. Washington in Louisiana. Lewis {{was a member of the}} National Afro-American Council founded by T. Thomas Fortune and heavily influenced by Washington. In 1898, Lewis was an active supporter of black troops' inclusion in the Spanish-American War. Lewis continued to be involved in politics. By 1898, the political tides had shifted, and Lewis was in support of the <b>Warmouth</b> wing in an atmosphere of extreme African-American vote suppression.|$|E
50|$|Round Lake is {{completely}} surrounded by private property, {{which means the}} public needs to obtain permission to access the lake for fishing. There are no swimming beaches on the lake and only private boat and fishing docks. The Hook and Bullet website always lists the types of fish in lakes {{whether or not there}} is free public access to them. The website says this lake contains a large variety of fish. This website lists pumpkinseed, bluegill, yellow perch, bowfin, <b>warmouth,</b> gar, catfish (bullhead), green sunfish, carp, largemouth bass, crappie and rock bass.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifeblood of}} the fishery is the basin's annual {{flooding}} and dewatering cycle. Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered {{during the summer and}} fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin. Largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, <b>warmouth,</b> bluegill, redear sunfish, and channel catfish are the primary species sought. More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre (100 g/m²). Red swamp and white river crayfish are also important for both a sport and commercial harvest.|$|E
