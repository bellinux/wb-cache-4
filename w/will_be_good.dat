5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel. Mainly, {{the debate over the}} nature of 'Good Society' and how to achieve it are seen in the positions of the Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring about the good society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring about the Good Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of such behavior by both the ruler and the ruled <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for everyone.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E

Vice-President of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla, said that all Boeing 737-300s should be checked.

There were also suggestions that Adam Air should be suspended from all operations until the entire fleet could be checked, with MP Abdul Hakim saying [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for the company and the government ... until the flight authorities can determine if Adam Air is still worthy as national aircraft company".|$|E

Ted Dewan, writing for the Times Educational Supplement, believed it to be [...] "far more compelling than a standard text," [...] but found it less adventurous than he hoped for. He also criticized its use in mathematics education, stating [...] "I suspect this is the sort of book that well-meaning adults will mistakenly thrust upon children because it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he harboured intentions of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released in 1990. Though the film had received critical acclaim over the years, its commercial failure had devastated his father, producer Yash Johar. The idea of a possible remake materialised on the sets of Johar's directorial My Name Is Khan, in which Karan Malhotra was an assistant director. Johar told Malhotra of his desire to remake the original film {{and asked him to}} revisit it again. On not directing the film himself, Johar commented, [...] "I am happy directing films on love, romance and drama. That's what I do best.

500|$|Overmars {{signed for}} Arsenal in June 1997. The fee was {{reported}} to be between £5million and £7million, with the player on a five-year contract, paid £18,000 per week. Overmars relished the challenge of playing in England: [...] "I like English football because there is more pace. With my speed and quality I think it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for me here." [...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything that goes with it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were maybe the best away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football. Wenger felt the signing of Overmars would rectify that problem.|$|E
500|$|The deal {{attracted}} mass {{attention from}} the media. Neil Harman, then of the Daily Mail, questioned the power broadcasters and Premier League chairman now had over fixture scheduling. He concluded his piece with a warning: [...] "The game has already reached saturation coverage, now {{it is likely to}} be choked. Football on six days out of seven per week <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for no-one." [...] The Independent noted that this was a [...] "remarkable coup" [...] for BSkyB, given the company's fluctuating fortunes. The Guardian correspondent David Lacey suggested that fans were the biggest losers: [...] "A lot of people who want to watch matches regularly in future are going to have to buy a bond or a dish." [...] Bryan Davies, Baron Davies of Oldham described the arrangement as [...] "absolutely appalling" [...] and Football Supporters' Association chairman Craig Brewin criticised the [...] "obscene" [...] amounts of money clubs earned as part of the deal.|$|E

Portman was chosen especially for her performances in [...] (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996), which impressed Lucas. He stated, [...] "I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [...] Natalie embodied all those traits and more". Portman was unfamiliar with Star Wars before being cast, but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power.
