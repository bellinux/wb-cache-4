5|$|On March 13, 2015 DC Comics {{released}} 25 Joker-themed variant {{covers for}} its various monthly series for release that June, {{in celebration of}} the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> as if gesturing to shoot her.|$|E
25|$|In the background, and to {{the left}} of the men {{surrounding}} Wolfe, an approaching runner is depicted. He is waving his hat in one hand to attract their attention, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> carries a captured flag with the Fleur-de-lis (a symbol of France)—symbolic of the news relayed to the dying Wolfe that the French were being defeated.|$|E
25|$|The coat must be {{stripped}} by hand or a non-cutting knife {{to retain its}} weather-resistant qualities. This does not hurt the dog when done properly. Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest. Never cut the coat – use your fingers or a non-cutting knife. If the coat is clipped, it loses colour and becomes softer, thus losing its weather-resistant characteristics. For the same reason the coat should not be washed too often, as detergents take away the natural skin oils. Most Irish terriers only need washing when dirty.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's come of Glynn?" [...] inquired Captain Dunning, as he {{accepted}} a large cup of smoking tea with one <b>hand,</b> and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>handed</b> {{a plate of}} buttered toast to Dr Hopley, who sat next him.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} {{is held in}} a crook of the arm and the string is held {{in the palm of}} the same hand that holds the instruments. Then the taut string is plucked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand's</b> fingers or <b>with</b> a striker to produce a unique sound.|$|R
50|$|The full deal diagram {{is usually}} drawn <b>with</b> North at <b>the</b> top, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hands</b> {{following}} their normal compass orientation. For convenience and consistency, South is usually declarer, {{so that the}} reader can see the hand as if playing it; exceptions to this rule can occur when reporting deals from actual matches, but even then the players' seats are often rotated to follow this convention.|$|R
25|$|Typically, {{a player}} faces the basket {{with both feet}} facing the basket. A player will rest {{the ball on the}} {{fingertips}} of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{families}} of manual alphabets used for representing the Latin alphabet {{in the modern}} world. The more common of the two is mostly produced on one hand, and {{can be traced back}} to alphabetic signs used in Europe from at least the early 15th century. The alphabet, first described completely by Spanish monks, was adopted by the Abbé de l'Épée's deaf school in Paris in the 18th century, and was then spread to deaf communities around the world in the 19th and 20th centuries via educators who had learned it in Paris. Over time, variations have emerged, brought about by natural phonetic changes that occur over time, adaptions for local written forms with special characters or diacritics (which are sometimes represented <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand),</b> and avoidance of handshapes that are considered obscene in some cultures. The most widely used modern descendant is the American manual alphabet.|$|E
500|$|It had {{an ornate}} basin, a marble cannon {{barrel-shaped}} spout, {{topped by a}} bronze statue of Neptune holding a trident in one hand, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> resting on an escutcheon containing Wignacourt's coat of arms. The statue {{is based on the}} Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune. The marble of the spout has a Latin inscription which says: ...|$|E
5000|$|One day, after {{numerous}} vicious beatings at Covey's hands, Douglass fought back. He {{fought off}} Covey's cousin and his fight with Covey himself, which lasted nearly two hours, ended with Douglass's victory. Douglass later wrote that [...] "It is, perhaps, not altogether creditable to my natural temper, that, after this conflict with Mr. Covey, I did, at times, purposely aim to provoke {{him to an}} attack, by refusing to keep <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>the</b> field, but I could never bully him to another battle." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{essence of}} metal {{drumming}} {{is creating a}} loud, constant beat for the band using the [...] "trifecta of speed, power, and precision". Metal drumming [...] "requires an exceptional amount of endurance", and drummers have to develop [...] "considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity... to play the intricate patterns" [...] used in metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal and some [...] "mainstream metal" [...] bands [...] "all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats".|$|E

The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, [...] "My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to fire the SAA rapidly by holding down the trigger and [...] "fanning" [...] the hammer <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> Ed McGivern dispelled {{the myth of the}} inaccuracy of this procedure by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{will you}} take with you, Mrs. Cox?" [...] said Bertram, as he stood up in <b>the</b> boat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> baby on one arm, while <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> he <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> lady towards the ship's ladder.|$|R
50|$|The number eleven {{plays an}} undeniably {{important}} role in the carnaval.The opinions on this subject are very divergent, so much so that one explanation often has nothing to do even <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other.On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>the</b> number eleven is not only central to the carnaval, but it has built up a kind of mystical and magical value through the ages.|$|R
50|$|Finite signed {{measures}} form a vector space, while extended signed {{measures are}} not even closed under addition, which makes them rather hard to work <b>with.</b> On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> measures are extended signed measures, but are not in general finite signed measures.|$|R
2500|$|The central panel, {{called the}} Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, depicts Mary {{seated on a}} throne beneath a {{baldachin}} covered with sumptuous brocade. Two seraphim hover directly beneath the canopy, holding her crown; they wear deep blue robes, and in the uncleaned version have blue faces and hands, a style evocative of earlier Netherlandish painters such as van der Weyden and Robert Campin. [...] The Christ child sits on his mother's lap, holding an apple {{in one hand and}} slipping the ring on St Catherine's finger to signify the mystic marriage <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Once snug and set, the hitch can be {{adjusted}} as needed. [...] To tighten the line {{with respect to a}} load attached to the standing part, the user can grasp the standing part with one hand inside of the loop and pull toward the anchor object. [...] The hitch may be grasped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> and as slack develops within the loop, the hitch slid away from the anchor object, taking up the slack and enlarging the loop. [...] To loosen, the hitch may be slid toward the anchor object, making the loop smaller and lengthening the standing part.|$|E
2500|$|Boxing at {{that time}} was very {{different}} from the boxing of today. [...] There were few rules. [...] There was no boxing organization to oversee the sport or lay down regulations or procedures. [...] There was no formal end to the fights: [...] they would go on until one fighter was unable to continue or would give up. [...] A now obsolete practice was that of the seconds. The seconds would wait in the ring during the fight, and assist the boxer between rounds. [...] There were no restrictions regarding fight tactics. [...] For example, a fighter could hit his opponent's head off a corner post, or wrestle his opponent to the ground, or pull his hair, or wrap his arm around his neck in a choking motion and then hit him in the face <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] The fights were very severe and often brutal, and they would continue until the end.|$|E
5000|$|Johnny Whoop, {{also known}} as Johnny, Johnny, is a children's hand game. One person holds out his or her hand and touches each finger <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand's</b> index finger, from the pinky to the index finger, then slides <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand's</b> index finger down between the index finger and the thumb, then touches the thumb, and the repeats the {{sequence}} in reverse. As the person touches each finger and the thumb, he or she says [...] "Johnny"; as the person slides the finger toward and back from the thumb, he or she says [...] "Whoop" [...] (or [...] "Whoops" [...] or [...] "Whoosh"). The result is the sequence [...] "Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Whoop, Johnny, Whoop, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny." [...] People in the surrounding group are then challenged to repeat the sequence precisely.|$|R
50|$|Iconography: She {{rides the}} bull, just like Goddess Shailputri. She has four arms, holding a Trishul {{in one of}} her right hands and depicts <b>the</b> Abhayamudra <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> right <b>hand.</b> She carries a Damaru in one left hand and depicts the Varadamudra in her <b>other</b> left <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|The attendants {{would have}} driven me back, but with age-quavering cackles Chong Mong-ju {{restrained}} them. He lifted {{himself on a}} shaking elbow, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> shaking <b>hand</b> drew wider apart the silken curtains. His withered old face was transfigured with delight as he gloated on us.|$|R
2500|$|... }} Stebbins was {{the first}} woman to receive a public {{commission}} for a major work of art in New York City. The bronze, eight-foot statue depicts a female winged angel touching down upon the top of the fountain, where water spouts and cascades into an upper basin and into the surrounding pool. [...] It was the only statue in the park called for in the original design. Beneath her are four four-foot cherubs representing Temperance, Purity, Health, and Peace. Also called the Angel of the Waters, the statue refers to Healing the paralytic at Bethesda, a story from the Gospel of John about an angel blessing the Pool of Bethesda, giving it healing powers. In Central Park the referent is the Croton Aqueduct opened in 1842, providing the city {{for the first time with}} a dependable supply of pure water: thus the angel carries a lily in one hand, representing purity, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> she blesses the water below.|$|E
2500|$|... 'The {{construction}} of his painting {{turns on the}} orchestration of these geometrical volumes, which shift their position, develop, interweave following the movements in space of the painter himself. Already we can see, {{as a consequence of}} this movement introduced into an art which, we were told, had no relation to movement, a plurality of perspective points. These architectural combinations of cubes supported the image as it appears to the senses, that of a woman whose torso is naked, holding in her left hand a cup while <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> she lifts a spoon to her lips. It can be easily understood that Metzinger is trying to master chance, he insists that each of the parts of his work must enter into a logical relationship with all the others. Each should, precisely, justify the other, the composition should be an organism as rigorous as possible and anything that looks accidental should be eliminated, or at least kept under control. None of that prevented either the expression of his temperament or the exercise of his imagination.' (Albert Gleizes) ...|$|E
2500|$|A fly reel is a single-action reel, {{normally}} {{operated by}} stripping line off the reel with one hand, while casting the rod <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] The {{main purpose of}} a fly reel is to store line, provide smooth uninterrupted tension (drag) when a fish makes a long run, and counterbalance the weight of your fly rod when casting. [...] When used in fly fishing, the fly reel or fly casting reel has traditionally been rather simple in terms of mechanical construction, and little has changed from the design patented by Charles F. Orvis of Vermont in 1874. Orvis first introduced {{the idea of using}} light metals with multiple perforated holes to construct the housing, resulting in a lighter reel that also allowed the spooled fly line to dry more quickly than a conventional, solid-sided design. [...] Early fly reels placed the crank handle {{on the right side of}} the reel. [...] Most had no drag mechanism, but were fitted with a click/pawl mechanism intended to keep the reel from overrunning when line was pulled from the spool. [...] To slow a fish, the angler simply applied hand pressure to the rim of the revolving spool (known as [...] "palming the rim"). [...] Later, these click/pawl mechanisms were modified to provide a limited adjustable drag of sorts. [...] Although adequate for smaller fish, these did not possess a wide adjustment range or the power to slow larger fish.|$|E
5000|$|Philpott {{operated}} several characters, {{including a}} goblin puppet that {{sat at the}} foot of the throne of Jareth the Goblin King, who was played by David Bowie. He also played one of the Fireys, the wild goblins that live in the forest and have detachable body parts that come apart; Philpott, who was credited as playing [...] "Firey No. 1," [...] controlled the various body parts along with puppeteers Kevin Clash and, once again, David Barclay. He also controlled the eyes of the Junk Lady character (played by Fraggle Rock performer Karen Prell) and was one of the many sets of hands among the Helping Hands, hand-shaped goblins that protruded from the walls of Jareth's castle and acted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hands</b> to create talking face-formations.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia sat down, {{tugged on}} one boot {{and fell into}} a reverie <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in her <b>hand,</b> while Prue clacked on like a wordmill in full operation.|$|R
3000|$|... eNBs are {{enhanced}} <b>with</b> programmability. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> {{they are}} Openflow‐based eNB {{and under the}} instruction of MC. The radio functions are kept the same as described in 3 GPP technical specification.|$|R
60|$|The {{little man}} gripped {{the rail and}} held on to his cap <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ken {{tried to}} {{simulate}} ungovernable rage and impotent distress at once. He waved one fist and tore his hair <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him wait," [...] {{said the}} Dey, {{resuming}} the pipe which for some minutes he had laid aside, and caressing the lion's head <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Weissmann did not {{smile as}} Serviss had expected. He became grave. [...] "I am not {{qualified}} to judge. Speaking generally, I would say there are many phases to be considered.

40|$|The {{background}} for this workshop {{is to be}} found in the conflicts that regularly arise between those who manage the fishery and those who practise the fishery. This happens in spite of the fact that the parties in principle have the same intention: On one hand the fishers want a fishery they can live by and <b>with,</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> <b>the</b> management formally wants to make fisheries sustainable, biologically, economically and socially...|$|R
