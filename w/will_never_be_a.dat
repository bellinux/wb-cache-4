25|$|Progressive {{revelation is}} a core {{teaching}} in the Bahá'í Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time {{through a series of}} divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance. Thus, the Bahá'í teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that there <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.|$|E

25|$|Philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), who {{regularly}} cited De la Court's works, described in his unfinished Tractatus Politicus (1677) how the ideal state, a democratic republic, should function. According to Spinoza, kings {{have a natural}} tendency to pursue their own personal interests, and entrust large portions of power to confidants (who lack any official mandate, but often de facto run the country if the king is a weakling). These confidants are often noblemen, making it an aristocracy instead of a monarchy in practice. The best monarchy is a quasi-monarchy, a crowned republic in which princes have as little power as possible. Spinoza proposes a council of state, elected by citizens, to take the most important decisions, and replace the murderous and pillaging royal mercenary armies by an unpaid draft army of citizens that defends its own country for self-preservation. If this council of state is large and representative enough, there <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> majority in favour of war, {{because of all the}} suffering, destruction and high taxes it will cause.|$|E

But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon".

Privately, Birkett believed that [...] "there <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> satisfactory law in England about obscenity. Our 1959 Act is the best we have yet done." [...] In 1961, he was again invited by the BBC to give a series of talks on the BBC Home Service, this time titled [...] "Six Great Advocates". He picked Edward Marshall-Hall, Patrick Hastings, Edward Clarke, Rufus Isaacs, Charles Russell and Thomas Erskine. He sat for the last time in the House of Lords on 8 February 1962, where he made a speech criticising an element of the Manchester Corporation Bill which would have water drained from Ullswater to meet the needs of the growing population in Manchester. His speech was [...] "deeply felt and eloquent", and when the votes were announced, Birkett and his supporters had won by 70 votes to 36.

500|$|Before Chamberlain, {{the most}} {{dominant}} big man in the NBA was [...] George Mikan. In November 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons held the ball for {{minutes at a time}} without shooting to limit the impact of the Minneapolis Lakers' Mikan. The Pistons attempted 13 shots in the game, and won 19–18. NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, [...] "In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores." [...] In the , teams averaged just above 80 points per game. The NBA introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954, and league scoring and attendance increased. By the , teams were averaging 119points each game. Chamberlain that season was one of 37black players in the league, the NBA having started integration of blacks in 1950. With their emergence, the NBA game was stylistically being played faster and above the rim. Many of the league's great players were black, and blacks believed they were limited by a league quota of four black players per team. Critics suggested that basketball was becoming uninteresting with taller players dominating. Warriors teammate Joe Ruklick thought that [...] "the attitude [...] was, in my opinion, ' is a freak who will come and go. There <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> black guy doing this again.'" [...] Chamberlain, nicknamed Dipper, was revolutionizing the sport with his slam dunks, nicknamed the Dipper Dunk. Traditionalists considered dunking poor sportsmanship, and their occurrence was rare. As the league's second tallest player, Chamberlain began dunking more regularly. He was still more of a finesse player, preferring fadeaway shots and finger rolls. He rarely dunked forcefully. Teammate Paul Arizin believed Chamberlain {{did not want to be}} perceived as great merely from being tall.|$|E
