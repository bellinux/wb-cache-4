5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of <b>whist,</b> Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear to be sad, <b>whist</b> AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
25|$|Auction pinochle {{for three}} players has some {{similarities}} with the German game skat, although the bidding is {{more similar to}} that of bid <b>whist.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Southards {{participated in}} the social life of Richmond, T. J. and his wife {{sometimes}} hosting <b>whist</b> parties or dances, the latter usually featuring the Virginia reel, at their Richmond home. A wide cross-section of the community was represented at these events.|$|E
25|$|Trump - a suit {{or other}} subset of {{cards in the}} deck that is of higher value than all others. Most games in the <b>Whist</b> family use a trump suit; in Spades, it is always the Spade suit. The term also refers to the playing of a trump card.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Elizabethan {{laws and}} church {{regulations}} prohibited playing tables, {{but by the}} 18th century, backgammon was popular among the English clergy. Edmund Hoyle published A Short Treatise on the Game of Back-Gammon in 1753; this described rules and strategy for the game and was bound together with a similar text on <b>whist.</b>|$|E
25|$|Buller was one {{of those}} {{responsible}} for contract bridge being adopted at the Portland Club, after the game and its new scoring system was brought to England by Lord Lascelles and Jimmie Rothschild in 1927. The Portland Club, which regulated the laws of <b>whist</b> since early in the nineteenth century, remains the law-giving body for bridge in Britain, and has taken part in every subsequent revision of the laws of bridge.|$|E

The neighborhood is also {{the location of the}} private University & <b>Whist</b> Club and the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, which hosts an annual Greek cultural festival.|$|E
25|$|Spades was devised in the United States in {{the late}} 1930s and became popular in the 1940s. It is unclear which game it is most {{directly}} descended from, but {{it is known that}} Spades {{is a member of the}} <b>Whist</b> family and is a simplification of Contract Bridge such that a skilled Spades player can learn Bridge relatively quickly (the major additional rules being dynamic trump, the auction, dummy play, and rubber scoring).|$|E
25|$|According to Stanley, in 1946, he was {{returning}} by train {{from a business}} trip to Manchester when the guard enquired whether he would make up a foursome for a game of solo <b>whist</b> with some other men. He consequently met George Gibson, {{a director of the}} Bank of England. Gibson's account is that his party had asked Stanley for small change for their game and that Stanley had recognised Gibson through a common acquaintance, Cyril Ross.|$|E
25|$|Henry Ernest Weaver (captain / supercargo), {{had been}} married in London in 1873 and then {{made his way to}} Brisbane. In March 1875 the master (Goodall) of the Queen May, a regular blackbirding vessel, died <b>whist</b> {{unloading}} supplies at Rockhampton. The mate then took over command but was then caught by floods in Rockhampton. So Henry Weaver was appointed as captain but after about {{a day and a half}} at sea the crew reported Weaver as insane and had fears for his safety. Alexander Goodall, aged 18, and a son of the just deceased Captain Goodall, was chosen by the crew as master and he proceeded back to Gladstone and handed Weaver over to the authorities.|$|E
500|$|Olympic Revels was Planché's first {{example of}} [...] "that form of travestie which is {{commonly}} described as 'classical'—which {{deals with the}} characteristics and adventures of gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines, of the Greek and Latin mythology and fable", a genre {{of which he was}} later credited as originator. Planché used costume for comedic effect, not by the costumes being comic, but by the incongruity of realistic historical dress being juxtaposed with the actions of the actors. For example, Olympic Revels opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing <b>whist.</b> By 1836 these classical burlesques had become so popular that other writers were copying them.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the trial}} the prince changed his {{behaviour}} to some extent, {{and although he}} continued to gamble, he did so in a more discreet manner; he stopped playing baccarat altogether, taking up <b>whist</b> instead. While he was unpopular {{at the end of}} the case, Ridley considers that the matter [...] "probably did little serious damage to... standing"; Havers, Grayson and Shankland agree, and write that by 1896, when the prince's horse Persimmon won the Epsom Derby, the prince [...] "had never been more popular". Matthew observes that it was only when one of the prince's own circle of confidantes brought him to court that the newspapers would [...] "seriously harr him... the British in the 1890s had no general wish to see their future monarch fail".|$|E
500|$|Equipment {{varies with}} the game. Board games, such as Go, Monopoly or backgammon need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is Senet, a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the pharaoh Tutankhamun. [...] Card games, such as <b>whist,</b> poker and Bridge have long been played as evening {{entertainment}} among friends. For these games, {{all that is needed}} is a deck of playing cards. Other games, such as bingo, played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via gambling. Many are geared for children, and can be played outdoors, including hopscotch, hide and seek, or Blind man's bluff. The list of ball games is quite extensive. It includes, for example, croquet, lawn bowling and paintball as well as many sports using various forms of balls. The options cater {{to a wide range of}} skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in motor skills. Number games such as Sudoku and puzzle games like the Rubik's cube can develop mental prowess.|$|E
500|$|The 22-year-old Gibson was a {{passenger}} aboard Titanics maiden voyage, joining the ship at Cherbourg in France {{on the evening}} of April 10. She had been on vacation in Europe with her mother when her employers, the Eclair Film Company, recalled her to New York City to participate in a new production. On the evening of the sinking, she was playing bridge (this would have been bridge <b>whist,</b> a predecessor to today's game) in a first-class saloon before retiring to the cabin that she shared with her mother. The game was later credited with saving the lives of the players who had stayed up late to finish it, despite it being (as one American writer put it) [...] "a violation of the strict Sabbath rules of English vessels." [...] The collision with the iceberg at 11:40 pm sounded to Gibson like a [...] "long, drawn, sickening scrunch". After going to investigate, she fetched her mother when she saw Titanics deck beginning to list as water flooded into the ship's boiler rooms.|$|E
500|$|On Venerable, Duncan {{assembled}} all {{of those}} men fit to attend for a church service to [...] "return thanks to Almighty God for all His mercies showered on them and him." [...] For the next 24 hours the 66-year-old Duncan remained on duty without a break, organising the scattered fleet on its journey home. The British admiral did find time however {{to play a game}} of <b>whist</b> in his cabin with De Winter after dinner: when the Dutch admiral lost a rubber, he commented that it was hard to be beaten twice in one day by the same man. On 13 October, Duncan completed his official despatch and sent it ahead of his wallowing ships with Captain William George Fairfax on the cutter Rose: he praised all of his men, reserving special mention for Trollope and the late Burges, whom he called a [...] "good and gallant Officer…a sincere Friend". De Winter was permitted to send despatches to the Batavian government, in which he blamed Story and his centre for not maintaining the combat longer. He also attributed overwhelming British numbers to his defeat and suggested that he may have captured some of the British fleet if he had been better supported. When this letter was later published it provoked a storm of criticism in Britain, one officer describing it as [...] "a garbled account which, for ought I know, might have been collected by people on shore who knew nothing of the action".|$|E
500|$|During the war years, {{a number}} of Butlin's camps were used as Royal Navy shore establishments. Skegness became , a {{training}} establishment for petty officers; Pwllheli became HMS Glendower, and Ayr became HMS Scotia. Filey became RAF Hunmanby Moor and Clacton, after being considered {{for use as a}} prisoner of war camp, was later used as a training site for the Pioneer Corps. Butlin was recruited by the Ministry of Supply and asked to look at the causes of low morale amongst the workers in Britain's munitions factories. His first stop was at the Royal Ordnance Factory, Chorley, where he found that the camouflaged huts and barbed wire fences used to house workers gave them the feeling of being interned. Using the knowledge and experience he had gained in setting up his holiday camps, Butlin was able to devise activities and systems to boost morale, which led to his appointment as Director General of Hostels. In this position, Butlin introduced games and entertainment similar to those used in his holiday camps. These included: <b>whist</b> drives, amateur dramatics, theatrical productions and cinema. In 1943, he encouraged workers to continue taking their holiday entitlement but to do so at home, arranging various travelling fairs to visit towns on their [...] "holiday week". Butlin's appointment to this role gave cause for concern in some quarters, with questions being asked of the under-secretary, Harold Macmillan, about the nature of his involvement. However the appointment was a voluntary one with no salary or expenses and had been made after the consideration of other suitable candidates.|$|E
2500|$|The term slam {{for winning}} {{all of the}} tricks in the [...] (see also <b>whist</b> terms) is attested from early in the 17th century. Grand slam {{for all of the}} tricks, in {{contrast}} to small slam or little slam for all but one, dates from early in the 19th century. This use was inherited by contract bridge, a modern development of <b>whist</b> defined in 1925 that became very popular in Britain and America by 1930.|$|E
2500|$|Hearts is an [...] "evasion-type" [...] trick-taking {{playing card}} game for four players, {{although}} variations can accommodate 3–6 players. The game {{is also known}} as Black Lady, Black Maria, Black Widow, and Slippery Bitch, though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game {{is a member of the}} <b>Whist</b> family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among <b>Whist</b> variants in that it is an evasion-type game; players avoid winning certain penalty cards in tricks, usually by avoiding winning tricks altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Spades is a trick-taking {{card game}} devised in the United States in the 1930s. It {{can be played}} as either a {{partnership}} or solo/"cutthroat" [...] game. The object is {{to take at least}} the number of tricks (also known as [...] "books") that were bid before play of the hand began. Spades is a descendant of the <b>Whist</b> family of card games, which also includes Bridge, Hearts, and Oh Hell. Its major difference as compared to other <b>Whist</b> variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trumps, hence the name.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{versions}} is Tarneeb, {{played in}} the Arab countries. The main alteration {{between the two is}} that Tarneeb uses all four suits, not just Spades, therefore the game may be considered a variation of <b>Whist.</b> Tarneeb, (Arabic: طرنيب) means [...] "trump".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} The New Cold War: Putin's Russia and the Threat to the West, {{published}} 2008, Edward Lucas stated that [...] "though Nord Stream's backers {{insist that the}} project is business pure and simple, this {{would be easier to}} believe if it were more transparent." [...] In the report published by the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in 2008, Norwegian researcher Bendik Solum <b>Whist</b> noted that Nord Stream AG was incorporated in Switzerland, [...] "whose strict banking secrecy laws makes the project less transparent {{than it would have been}} if based within the EU". [...] Secondly, the Russian energy sector [...] "in general lacks transparency" [...] and Gazprom [...] "is no exception".|$|E
2500|$|United Kingdom– The Pedal Cycles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1983 require pedal cycles [...] "so {{constructed}} {{that one}} or more of the wheels is incapable of rotating independently of the pedals, be equipped with a braking system operating on the front wheel"; riding a fixed-gear bicycle with no front brake on the street is illegal. Following the conviction of UK cyclist Charlie Alliston, who knocked over and killed a woman <b>whist</b> riding a fixed-gear bicycle with no front brake, the UK Government announced a review of the laws covering [...] "dangerous cycling" [...] in September 2017. [...] A brake on the rear wheel is only required for free-wheel bicycles.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "" [...] of 60 volunteers (in four {{batches of}} 15) arrived each {{week at the}} CRU. They listened to {{introductory}} talks from the Commanding Officer and Medical Officer. After this, the programme was entirely voluntary except for an interview when a participant left the CRU. Participants {{had the opportunity to}} attend workshops, visit nearby workplaces or have work-experience placements. They were able to attend group discussions, meet with the Vocational Officer to talk about careers, and meet with the Civil Liaison Officer to talk about social or relationship concerns. <b>Whist</b> drives and dances were held at the CRUs, bringing the local civilian population to the Unit with the intention of helping civilians and repatriated POWs to interact and adjust to one another. Men were not required to wear their military uniforms except for the pay parade when they were given their salaries.|$|E
2500|$|Caroline {{was brought}} up with an extreme degree of {{seclusion}} from contact with the opposite sex even for her own time. She was reportedly constantly supervised by her governess and elder ladies, restricted to her room when the family was entertaining guests and ordered to keep away from the windows. She was normally refused permission to attend balls and court functions, and when allowed, she was forbidden to dance. Abbé Baron commented {{during the winter of}} 1789–90: [...] "She is supervised with the greatest severity, as they claim she is already aware of what she is missing. I doubt if the torches of hymen will illuminate for her. Although always attired with style and elegance, she is never allowed to dance", and that as soon as the first dance begun, she was forced to sit down at the <b>whist</b> table with three old ladies. A rare occasion was the wedding of her elder brother Charles, when she was finally allowed to dance, though only with her brother, the groom, and her new brother-in-law, the Prince of Orange – she was, however, still forbidden to dine alone with her brother.|$|E
2500|$|The 2009 {{statement}} by U.S. President Barack Obama on Armenian Remembrance Day claimed that, [...] "reckoning {{with the past}} holds out a powerful promise of reconciliation," [...] before going on to state that, [...] "the best way to advance that goal right now is for the Armenian and Turkish people to address {{the facts of the}} past as part of their effort to move forward," [...] and reaffirming his strong support for [...] "efforts by the Turkish and Armenian people to work through this painful history {{in a way that is}} honest open and constructive," [...] but although, as previously indicated, US President Obama did not use the word ‘genocide’ his use of the Armenian term Meds Yeghern, translated as [...] "Great Crime" [...] or [...] "Calamity", managed to offend both sides of the dispute. Armenian groups felt betrayed at the reversal of promises of recognition made during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election <b>whist</b> Turkish authorities felt that Obama had gone back on promises made during the recent 2009 US presidential visit to Turkey. Despite not saying the word genocide, Obama made it clear that he had not changed his views about the Armenian Genocide in the statement, saying [...] "I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view of that history has not changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{began his}} theatre career by {{diverting}} {{the audience with}} a few tricks between plays, but by 1834 he was providing the whole programme at Wolverhampton's Assembly Rooms. These were {{on the first floor}} of the , built 1829 in Queen Street. The performance was in three parts. In Part I he demonstrated the Chest of Archimedes and the Column of Rosbach. These were entertaining pieces of mechanical apparatus previously shown at the Cabinet of curiosities in Paris. This was followed by numerous illusions, including A Game at <b>Whist,</b> Time Flies, The Wax Candles Enchanted, Elephant of Knowledge, Vulcan's Forge, Miraculous Printing, Flying Watch, Magic Bottle, Apples of Beelzebub, Magic Eggs and Loyal Metamorphose. Part II began with a ventriloquist act called Rogueries of Nicholas. He followed this by whistling various birdsong impressions. This popular party piece was developed via a [...] "variety of scenes and characters drawn from nature, introductory of His Surprising Powers of Imitation" [...] in which he contorted his face, told stories and performed tricks of ventriloquism. In Part III he performed [...] "feats of strength in the character of a Chinese buffo", suggesting that in Parts I and II he was most likely wearing the customary evening dress of the Victorian theatre magician, and that such a costume was less suitable for acrobatics than loose Chinese pyjamas. The strongman act was followed by [...] "gymnastic exercises" [...] or acrobatics involving bodily contortions with a balancing act. Last of all came the climax of the performance: the Aerial Suspension Illusion. In certain theatres he used to ban sale of tickets to the gallery, because the view from there might betray the secret of the illusion.|$|E
