5|$|In Cyprus, all the kingdoms had revolted {{except that}} of Amathus. The {{leader of the}} Cypriot revolt was Onesilus, brother of the king of Salamis, Gorgus. Gorgus {{did not want to}} revolt, so Onesilus locked his brother out of the city and made himself king. Gorgus <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Persians, and Onesilus persuaded the other Cypriots, apart from the Amathusians, to revolt. He then settled down to besiege Amathus.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1944, Tito {{offered a}} general amnesty {{and many in}} the {{division}} took advantage of this opportunity. During {{the first three weeks}} of September, while hard fighting continued, over 2,000 Bosnians deserted, many taking their weapons with them. They went home, joined the Green Cadres militia or <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Ustaše. Many defected to the Partisans, with over 700 having joined the Partisan 3rd Corps by early October.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E

5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken {{in a series}} of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate to side with Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by the representatives of the two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it was an instant success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the war, the tide was in favour of the regency, until, in the summer of 1342, Kantakouzenos was forced to flee to the court of Stefan Dušan of Serbia. However, from 1343 onwards, with the aid of his friend, Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos began to reverse the situation. With the initial support of Stefan Dušan, Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia, and despite his failure to take Thessalonica, his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace. Gradually, Apokaukos's {{supporters}} abandoned him, including his son Manuel, who deserted his post at Adrianople and <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Kantakouzenos camp.|$|E

Several of the Hamdanid ghilman, resenting the {{influence}} of Lu'lu', <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Fatimids, who now launched a sustained offensive against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin. Only the personal intervention of Basil II in 995 and again in 999 would save the emirate from Fatimid conquest. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's continued existence as a buffer state between the two powers. Finally, in 1002, Lu'lu' assassinated Sa'id al-Dawla and assumed control of Aleppo in his own name.|$|E
5|$|The defeats {{suffered}} in February and March accelerated {{the disintegration of}} the GUNT. When in March, at a new round of OAU-sponsored talks held in the People's Republic of Congo, Goukouni failed to appear, many suspected the hand of Libya. These suspicions caused the defection from the GUNT of its vice president, Kamougué, followed by the First Army and the piecemeal FROLINAT Originel. In August, it was the CDR's turn to leave the coalition, seizing the town of Fada. When in October Goukouni's FAP attempted to retake Fada, the Libyan garrison attacked Goukouni's troops, giving way to a pitched battle that effectively ended the GUNT. In the same month, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, while his troops rebelled against Gaddafi, dislodging the Libyans from all their positions in the Tibesti, and on 24 October <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Habré.|$|E
5|$|According to al-Tabari, {{the young}} Ibn al-Ash'ath {{accompanied}} {{his father and}} participated in his political activities: in 680 he revealed the hiding-place of Muslim ibn Aqil to the authorities, and he fought in the campaign against al-Mukhtar in which his father was killed, and reportedly executed (or persuaded Mu'sab ibn al-Zubayr to execute) al-Mukhtar's captured followers in revenge. Ibn al-Ash'ath disappears from the record {{during the next few}} years, but after Mu'sab ibn al-Zubayr was defeated and killed by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in October 691, he, like other followers of Mu'sab, apparently <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Umayyads. In early 692, Abd al-Malik's brother Bishr put him in command of over 5,000 Kufans for a campaign against the Kharijites threatening al-Ahwaz. The Kharijites retreated before the far larger caliphal army, led by Khalid ibn Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, and Ibn al-Ash'ath went on to take up the governorship of Rayy.|$|E

5|$|In late 908 Eustathios Argyros was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} magistros—the highest court dignity open to someone {{not a member of the}} imperial family—and the post of Drungary of the Watch, i.e. commander of the imperial bodyguard, and replaced as strategos of Charsianon by Constantine Doukas. About a year later, he fell again under Leo's suspicion, and was ordered to return to his family's estates at Charsianon. Again the reason is unknown; perhaps, according to Cheynet and Vannier, it was a result of the unreliability of the Armenian lords he had welcomed into the Empire, who frequently <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Arabs. On the way, he died after taking poison by one of his servants, and was buried on Spynin, the summit of Mount Aran. While historian Romilly James Heald Jenkins has suggested that Argyros' poisoning was done through an agent of the powerful and scheming court eunuch Samonas, it more likely was suicide. His two sons, Pothos and Leo, who served in the palace as manglabites (personal bodyguards of the emperor), arranged to have their father's body transferred for burial to the monastery of Saint Elizabeth in the Charsianon district, founded by Eustathios' father.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
5|$|One {{significant}} factor in the decline was the rise of grunge music from Seattle, with bands including Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. This was particularly obvious after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a dirty sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes, a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style and performance. Many major labels felt they had been caught off-guard by the surprise success of grunge and began turning over their personnel in favor of younger staffers more versed in the new scene. As MTV shifted its attention to the new style, glam metal bands found themselves relegated increasingly to late night airplay, and Headbanger's Ball was cancelled {{at the end of}} 1994, while KNAC <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Spanish programming. Given glam metal's lack of a major format presence on radio, bands were left without a clear way to reach their audience. Other (earlier Hollywood) alternative rock bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction also helped supplant the popularity of the genre.|$|E

5|$|The 331st Rifle Division {{was formed}} as a {{standard}} Red Army rifle division {{in the summer of}} 1941, based on a cadre of volunteer workers and reservists from the Bryansk oblast, and so was known from the beginning as the 331st Bryansk Proletarian Rifle Division. It fought to defend Moscow during the last stages of the German invasion, and then <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the offensive in early December. It spent much of the next twelve months in the same general area, west of the capital, taking part in the mostly futile battles against the German-held salient at Rzhev. On September 25, 1943, the division shared credit with several other units for the liberation of the city of Smolensk and was given its name as an honorific. The 331st had a highly distinguished career as a combat unit, ending its combat path in Czechoslovakia, advancing on Prague.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{remained in}} reserve until April 1918, when German forces attacked {{as part of}} the Spring Offensive. During the Battle of the Lys, the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was effectively wiped out, leaving a two-mile wide gap in the British lines. The 33rd was ordered into position, and Pinney personally commanded the divisional machine-gun battalion, which—with the assistance of various stragglers from retreating units—helped turn back a heavy German attack at the Battle of Hazebrouck on 12 and 13 April. For his service in April, Pinney, along with the commanders of the 12th, 55th and 61st Divisions, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. The 33rd was used to train the American 30th Infantry Division through the summer, but <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the offensive in September, seeing action at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal, the Battle of Cambrai, and the Battle of the Selle. At the Selle, Pinney organised a dawn attack with improvised bridges, allowing the 33rd to force a bridgehead and successfully clear the opposing bank in a short time. The division finished the war in the Sambre valley, and began demobilisation. In February 1919, with the division mostly demobilised, Pinney retired from the army, aged fifty-six, after thirty-five years service.|$|E
5|$|This {{reliance}} on eunuchs caused some hostility in the military; resentment at Staurakios's appointment to this powerful post {{is given by}} the Byzantine chroniclers {{as the reason for}} the (initially secret) defection of the prominent Armenian strategos of the Bucellarian Theme, Tatzates, to the Arabs in 782. This was a critical blow to the Byzantines, who at that time had almost succeeded in encircling the invading army of the future Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809). On Tatzates's suggestion, Harun asked for negotiations, but when the imperial envoys, including Staurakios, arrived, they were seized and held as hostages. At this point, Tatzates and his men publicly <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Caliph. Staurakios and the other envoys were released only when Empress Irene accepted the Caliph's harsh terms for a three-year truce, including the annual payment of an enormous tribute of 70,000 or 90,000 gold dinars and the handing over of 10,000 silk garments.|$|E

5|$|Around 12:00, the Italians <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the offensive, {{with the}} 3rd Alpine Group tasked {{to advance to}} the line Selca–Radovljica, XI Corps to push via Logatec to Ljubljana, VI Corps to drive on Prezid, and V Corps to advance from Fiume towards Kraljevica then Lokve. While one Italian attack south of the Snežnik plateau was stopped by {{elements}} of the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski and the Italian advance was held up by border troops in some areas, there was little significant resistance, {{and by the end of}} the day they had captured Sušak, Bakar, Delnice, Jesenice, Vrhnika, Logatec and Ljubljana. To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region, and the 14th Panzer Division, which had captured Zagreb on 10 April, drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army. The Italians faced little resistance, and captured about 30,000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice. When the Italian 14th Infantry Division Isonzo entered Ljubljana, a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander, Generale di Divisione Federico Romero, and symbolically handed him the keys to the city. An official reception was held for Romero that evening, attended by Natlačen and most of the members of the NszS, but because Natlačen and the council preferred that the Germans occupy Ljubljana, he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 717, Maslama with his army crossed from Asia into Europe over the Dardanelles, and {{proceeded}} to besiege Constantinople from land and sea. His navy, however, was soon neutralized {{by the use of}} Greek fire, and as his army was unable to overcome the city's land defences, the siege continued into the winter, which was especially severe that year, with snow covering the ground for three months. Maslama had brought along many supplies, but they either soon ran out or were lost—Arab accounts make much of Leo tricking the Arab general yet again during negotiations into handing over or destroying a significant part of his hoarded supplies—and the army began to suffer from hunger and disease. In spring, reinforcements arrived in the shape of two large fleets from Egypt and Ifriqiya, but a large part of their crews, who were mostly conscripted Christians, <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Byzantines, and Leo's navy managed to destroy or capture the Arab fleets. The Byzantines also defeated an Arab army marching to aid the besiegers through Asia Minor, while Maslama's men had to contend with attacks by the Bulgars as well, which cost them many men. The siege had clearly failed, and the new Caliph, Umar II (r. 717–720), ordered Maslama to retreat. On 15 August 718, after thirteen months of siege, the Arabs departed.|$|E
5|$|To face these insurgencies, al-Ma'mun {{turned to}} another of Tahir's sons, Abdallah ibn Tahir, {{to whom he}} {{entrusted}} the command of his army. Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn Shabath in northern Syria and the Jazira. Nasr was willing to acknowledge al-Ma'mun's authority, but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids' Persian officials, so {{that he had to}} be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital, Kaysum, in 824–825. After securing his northern flank, Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt. There the two rivals, although not opposed in principle to al-Ma'mun as Caliph, were eager to maintain the status quo, and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad. Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both, so that Ali al-Jarawi quickly <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him, leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad. In Alexandria, Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians, who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete, which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate. On his return to Baghdad in 827, Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception, and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828, replacing Talha. His place in the west was taken over by al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim. In Yemen, another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad, but al-Ma'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations.|$|E
