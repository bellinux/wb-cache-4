2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago? Is it easier {{for you to go}} and buy things in the stores than it <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E

The company produces two concerts in Atlanta each year, including the Modern Atlanta Dance Festival, performs in festivals, tours, and presents site-specific and community works. Critically acclaimed works choreographed by Artistic Director Douglas Scott include [...] "Passione", [...] "Crawl/Climb", [...] "Touch", [...] "Bar Songs", [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and it <b>is</b> yesterday", and [...] "SNAPSHOT".|$|R
5000|$|Jason Scales of Illinois Entertainer added, 'Political-social {{commentary}} and a firm {{belief in the}} power of positive thinking punctuate Marcus Singletary’s Capitol Hill. Dreamy, jam-based blues largely carries the message, including this line from 'Super Tuesday': 'Are you better off now than you <b>were</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> / It's time for a change.' [...] The 2006 compilation Rocks documented highlights from these recordings as a 'sampling of Singletary's recorded blues resume.' ...|$|R

50|$|Using {{a mix of}} guts, muscle, and brains, Anderson {{builds a}} {{reputation}} as a cool-headed tough whose only interest is in a quick dollar. He manages to infiltrate the mob, but soon finds himself in over his head. In what he thinks willbe a simple heist, he becomes an unwilling accessory to the murder of the head of a rival trucking firm. In this he implicates not just himself but also Tyler Trucking and Gail, with whom he has developed a romantic attachment. Investigating the crime, Captain Domms fails to see through Anderson's Mac McCarthy disguise and proves himself no more able to enforce the law than he'd <b>been</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} temples in Thungapahad. Ramalayam {{is at the}} centre point of the village, Venugopala Swamy Temple, which <b>was</b> renovated <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>is</b> at the {{starting}} point to the village and Kanaka Durga Temple is {{at the other end}} of the village. There <b>are</b> also <b>four</b> churches in Thungapahad.|$|R

It <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> now, a summer evening--Tod standing between his youngsters Derek and Sheila, in a doorway of his white, black-timbered, creepered cottage, his sunburnt face and blue eyes the serenest things one could see in a day's march! ...|$|E

"But I'll tell you--and my {{stand on}} {{this is just the}} same as it <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and eight years ago, and it'll be my stand four years from now--yes, and eight years from now! What I tell everybody, and it can't be too {{generally}} understood, is that what we need first, last, and all the time is a good, sound business administration!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But as {{time went}} by, Aunt Mildred and Uncle grew to dislike you. They grew afraid. What was to become of me? You were {{destroying}} my life. My music? You know how my dream of it has dimmed away. That spring, when I first met you--I was twenty, and I {{was about to start}} for Germany. I was going to study hard.

5000|$|Ram Chaves Band, {{formerly}} known as Sutil Band, eventually had some changes {{when it comes to}} members. Their debut album Sutil consists of 12 original songs including their carrier single [...] "Kol Center" [...] which was written by Chaves, himself.

60|$|This <b>was</b> all <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> He worked hard, {{and after}} a while he bought a bear. When his bear ate up the India-rubber on my bicycle he was very much frightened, for he was afraid he might be sent to prison. But that was not the fright that made him run away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hawtrey, [...] "it's a {{thing that}} has been {{worrying}} me {{a good deal of}} late, because, as a matter of fact, I'm not much farther forward than I <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> In the meanwhile, Agatha, who has some talent for music, was in a first-class master's hands. Afterwards she gave lessons, and got odd singing engagements. A week ago, I had a letter from her in which she said that her throat was giving out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{first came}} to this country, {{there was a woman}} I loved passionately. She treated me as women of her kind only treat men like me; she ruined me, and left me. That <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> I love your daughter, Mr. Carr, but she has never heard it from my lips. I would not woo her until I had told you all. I have tried to do it ere this, and failed. Perhaps I should not now, but--" ...|$|E
60|$|When Marilla {{went out}} that evening {{to bring the}} cows from the back pasture, Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching, slipped into {{the house with the}} air of a burglar and crept upstairs. As a general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little bedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the {{minister}} came to tea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sim {{added that}} the channel’s {{behaviour}} illustrated a shift from their previously highbrow aspirations and was now very risk-averse in reality: [...] "The programmes <b>were</b> commissioned <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> before Channel 4's culture was stood on its head by Big Brother". He asked for his name {{to be removed from}} the credits of the final episode.|$|R
50|$|F-Zero GX {{does not}} mention the Grand Finale event, but instead the game states Sterling LaVaughn was racing during the F-Max era and the F-Zero Grand Prix <b>was</b> {{suspended}} <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> This game states the character Mighty Gazelle was injured in the huge accident <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> However, the Nintendo 64 game mentions that Mighty Gazelles accident and the accident that suspended the Grand Prix were two separate events.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was born}} in Posilippo, near Naples," [...] said she, [...] "and was the {{daughter}} of Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of that part. Gennaro was in my father's employment, and I came to love him, as any woman must. He had neither money nor position--nothing but his beauty and strength and energy--so my father forbade the match. We fled together, were married at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the money which would take us to America. This <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and we have been in New York ever since.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, all of ye, that I {{never was}} hard on you," [...] {{continued}} Thady, [...] "when, God knows, {{the money was}} wanted bad enough at Ballycloran. You know I've waited longer for what was owed than many a one has done who has never felt {{what it was to}} want a pound. Did I ever pull the roof off any of you? And though queer tenants you've most of you been, an't the same set on the land now mostly that there <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago?</b> There's none of you can call me a hard man, I think; and when I've stuck to you so long, it isn't now I'll break away from you." ...|$|E
60|$|That <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Did we {{have good}} luck? No! Luck {{has nothing to do}} with bonefishing. What happened? For one solid month each winter of those four years we had devoted {{ourselves}} to bonefishing with light tackle. We stuck to our colors. The space of this whole volume would not be half enough to tell our experience--the amaze, the difficulty, the perseverance, the defeat, the wonder, and at last the achievement. The season of 1918 we hooked about fifty bonefish on three-six tackles--that is, three-ounce tips and six-thread lines--and we landed fourteen of them. I caught nine and R. C. caught five. R. C.'s eight-pound fish justified our contention and crowned our efforts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{acquaintance}} {{was a short}} one, count. It <b>was</b> some <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> at Agen, that I met you, and had {{the misfortune}} to have trouble with your cousin, Count Raoul; but short as it was, it was sufficient to show me {{that you were a}} gentleman of heart, and to encourage me, now, to throw myself on your generosity." ...|$|R
5000|$|The game {{received}} mostly positive reception. IGN {{gave the}} Wii version a 7.5, stating [...] "The only great parts of Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games are {{the parts that}} have nothing to do with the Olympics. The new reality-ignoring Dream Events, the multiplayer London Party mode and the presentation of London itself are all wonderful here -- pick up a copy of the game if one of those items catches your eye. But the actual sports? They're the same here as they <b>were</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and anyone who's already got a copy of the first Mario & Sonic Olympic game sitting on the shelf doesn't need to double-dip." [...] They gave the 3DS version, which did not contain the [...] "London Party" [...] mode, a lower 6.5 score. Nintendo Power gave the 3DS version a 7.|$|R
40|$|As the 2012 {{election}} approaches, {{the choice}} which confronts the American people is more depressing than it <b>is</b> stark. <b>Four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> candidate Barack Obama generated {{a great deal}} of excitement, even optimism. It is hard to imagine any candidate from either party doing that in 2012. Additionally, neither party can present itself as the party of change or new ideas in the coming election...|$|R

They liked you at first as... as I liked you. But that <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The time passed by--a year, two years; and then they began to turn against you. They {{are not to be}} blamed. You spoke no word. They felt that you were destroying my life. It is four years, now, and you have never once mentioned marriage to them. What were they to think? What they have thought, that you were destroying my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|The baron {{shook his}} head sadly. [...] "Guy is better," [...] he said, [...] "but he is still weak and fragile, and the leeches tell me that a rough winter or an illness that would be nought to others might carry him off. I have small hopes that he will ever marry. I am sure that no such thought is in his mind. He is as eager now as he <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> {{that you should be}} a son to us, and a husband to Agnes. He has also earnestly {{expressed}} the wish, in which I also join, that you should take our name. You English have no family names, but that will come with other Norman customs, and marrying a De Burg it would seem natural that you should yourself become Wulf de Burg." ...|$|E
60|$|This prejudice, as {{she began}} to call it, seemed to her unaccountable, since she had never written complainingly, until she found at last, (which made her {{inclined}} to treat it with more respect,) that it was founded on what Edmund had reported. He had come to Fern Torr immediately after his visit to Oakworthy, very much out of spirits, and had poured out his anxieties to his friends, talking of Mr. and Mrs. Lyddell with less caution than he had used with Marian, and lamenting over the fate of his poor little cousins like something hopeless. Marian thought of Gerald, and her heart failed her, then she hoped again, for Gerald was coming home, and then she understood what Edmund had thought of it all, and knew that it was perfectly consistent with his last conversation with her. So she said that <b>was</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and that Edmund was very kind.|$|E
50|$|In a well-attended event, {{employees}} and stockholders gathered on September 25, 2010 {{to commemorate the}} bank's 15th anniversary at the Makati Sports Club. The reunion is unprecedented in the banking industry in the country, where close to 600 employees organized to hold a program that rivals any other gathering by any existing bank as of September 2010; considering that the company <b>was</b> consolidated <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
50|$|Incumbent President Jimmy Carter {{initially}} {{had a huge}} lead in the polls, due to the rally-around-the flag {{effect of}} the Iranian hostage crisis and the perceived extremism of Reagan. The continuing hostage crisis and the poor economy hurt Carter, and the prospect John B. Anderson running as an independent appealed to around 20% of Americans who saw Carter as a lesser evil to Reagan. As a result, Anderson took a third of Carter's support in the spring, but {{did not seem to}} hurt Reagan, despite Anderson being a Republican. Carter would never recover this loss of support, while Reagan would end up peeling around two-thirds of initial Anderson voters. This race remained close until near the end, when Reagan asked Americans if they were better off than they <b>were</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Afterwards Reagan managed to win a huge landslide victory in the general election.|$|R
60|$|Emerging from a {{rebellion}} of gigantic magnitude, aided, as it was, by the sympathies and assistance of nations {{with which we}} were at peace, eleven States of the Union <b>were,</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> left without legal State governments. A national debt had been contracted; American commerce was almost driven from the seas; the industry of one-half of the country {{had been taken from}} the control of the capitalist and placed where all labor rightfully belongs--in the keeping of the laborer. The work of restoring State governments loyal to the Union, of protecting and fostering free labor, and providing means for paying the interest on the public debt has received ample attention from Congress. Although your efforts have not met with the success in all particulars that might have been desired, yet on the whole they have been more successful than could have been reasonably anticipated.|$|R
