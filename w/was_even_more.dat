5|$|On June 16, nearly {{identical}} ultimata were issued to Latvia and Estonia, {{although they were}} given only eight hours to respond. With Lithuania already in Soviet hands, armed resistance in Latvia or Estonia <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> futile. All three states were occupied and lost their independence.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 {{ended in}} {{familiar}} fashion; they lost all ten matches, scoring only one goal and conceding 25; their best results were two one-goal losses to Slovakia and a 3–1 loss in Ireland. The 2014 World Cup qualifying tournament <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> disastrous. Andorra lost all their matches while conceding 30 goals and not scoring.|$|E

In the presence of regime switches, this <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> complicated as the dynamics <b>are</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> complex and essentially non-differentiable at the time of a regime switch.|$|R
5|$|Rusli's {{family was}} not pleased with the novel; his father {{condemned}} him in a letter, {{as a result of}} which Rusli never returned to Padang. His later novel, Anak dan Kemenakan (1958) <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> critical of older generation's inflexibility.|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became {{the base for}} the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E
5|$|Fame of Zamoyski, {{significance}} in life, endured after his death. He was praised by {{artists such as}} Szymon Starowolski and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, and historians, including Stanisław Staszic, Stanisław Tarnowski and Artur Śliwiński. There were also those critical of him: Hugo Kołłątaj, Józef Szujski, Michał Bobrzyński. Nonetheless, Polish historiography and culture treatment of Zamoyski is mostly positive, and historian Janusz Tazbir remarked that Zamoyski posthumous career <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> magnificent than his real one. Leśniewski, ending his recent biography of Zamoyski, concludes {{that he is a}} significant, if controversial, figure of Polish Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> difficult. Shallow {{water was}} needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel {{and as a result}} Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Russian-American {{interaction}} resumed {{with the}} Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, {{this time a}} full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as {{two of the biggest}} partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.|$|E
5|$|Innes' {{case against}} Marshall {{ended in a}} hung jury in 1814. Rather than retry the case, Marshall and Innes signed an {{agreement}} to end the legal battle in 1815. The agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish anything that was disrespectful of the other. Innes upheld {{his part of the}} agreement, but in 1824, eight years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated two-volume version of his History of Kentucky that <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> critical of Innes and others he suspected of participating in the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E

Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles. In early November 1962, after the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a framework to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed {{about the death of}} his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.|$|E
5|$|Takechi's Daydream {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world {{was focused on the}} country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Takechi's third film had suffered heavily from the governmental censorship, yet no legal action had been taken. Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to the pink film. Politics would be featured in many later films in the pink genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E
5|$|The French Atlantic fleet <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> {{dispersed}} {{than the}} British {{in the spring}} of 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly had sailed from Rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of the line at Brest to meet the threat posed by the British fleet under Lord Howe.|$|E

After beating Minnesota in the semifinals, UConn again {{defeated}} Tennessee for the National Championship. The win <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> special as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than {{everyone else in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|After taking 5/18 in an innings {{win over}} North Eastern Transvaal, Johnston was {{ineffective}} in the high-scoring drawn Fourth Test, taking 1/68. He took {{a total of}} 6/52 and scored 24 not out against Griqualand West, and finished the Test campaign with 3/22 in the Fifth Test in Port Elizabeth, taking all his wickets in the second innings as Australia completed an innings victory and took the series 4–0. It was a successful tour for Johnston, with 23 wickets at 17.04, taking the most wickets at the lowest average among the Australian pacemen among those who took more than three wickets. The entire first-class campaign <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> successful; Johnston took a total of 7/37 as the Australians ended their tour with an innings victory over a South African XI. Johnston ended the African summer with 53 wickets at 14.09.|$|E

5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, the Army had more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|Cagney <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> violent towards {{women in}} the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|Carr {{returned}} to Ace Books in 1984 {{as a freelance}} editor, launching {{a new series of}} Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Kim Stanley Robinson's The Wild Shore, Lucius Shepard's Green Eyes, and Michael Swanwick's In the Drift. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre. Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include Tom Doherty, who left to start Tor Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded Baen Books. Writers who have worked at Ace include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner.|$|E
