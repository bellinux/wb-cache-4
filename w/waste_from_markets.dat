40|$|Digestate {{coming from}} an Anaerobic Digestion unit in a Biogas Plant, feeded on cow manure and {{vegetable}} <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> <b>markets,</b> has been used. About 8 – 35 L polyethylene transparent bags have been employed as cultivation container, outdoor. Different aliquots of digestate, alone or mixed with commercial liquid fertiliser, {{were employed to}} cultivate in batch Scenedesus dimorphus, a freshwater green microalga, in the ENEA facilities of Casaccia Research Center, near Rome, Italy. The cultivation period was June–July 2013. The average daily yields of dry microalgae biomass varied from 20 mg/L/d to 60 mg/L/d, mean 38. 2 mg/L/d. Final dry biomass concentration varied from 0. 18 to 1. 29 g/L, mean 0. 55 g/L. S. dimorphus proved to be very efficient in removing N and P from the culture medium.

40|$|Fish {{waste is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} major bio-pollutants which are generally discarded in coastal regions through local markets and fish processing industries. Nowadays, it is being eyed as a newer bioresource. Fish scales are good source of chitin and chitosan. Very little information is available related to extraction of chitosan from fish scales. In this study fish scale <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> <b>markets</b> around Chennai was used for extraction of chitosan. Chitosan is extracted from the fish scales and the physicochemical properties of the extracted chitosan were characterized by FTIR, UV-Visible spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The antibacterial activity of chitosan against different sea food pathogens pathogens like Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhii, Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae was evaluated by calculation of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Antioxidant activity for chitosan was performed with various concentration of 20 µm- 100 µm and the scavenging activity of the sample is calculated as 15 %. The physiochemical properties and FTIR and XRD studies confirm the production of chitosan, because of its high antibacterial activity against pathogens, hence chitosan can be widely used in food preservation, manufacture of wound dressing and in antimicrobial finished textiles...|$|E

This {{research}} was to evaluate the potency of organic <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> the traditional <b>market</b> as pig feed. The {{research was}} a survey upon the availability of organic wastes in the Oeba traditional market by collecting data such as type, {{quantity and quality of}} organic wastes as the measurement variables.

40|$|Abstract: Vegetable <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> <b>market</b> {{and homes}} are source of {{environmental}} pollution, global climatic changes {{and human health}} hazards. Methods of their disposal and management are not satisfactory. Earlier studies on vermicomposting of kitchen and vegetable waste could not provide a simple and satisfactory method of waste recycling. Therefore, the study was taken up. Vegetable waste was mixed with paper, sand-soil mixture and after pre-decomposition for 20 days, 30 earthworms were released. The cultures were maintained for three months and then observations on number and weight of worms, temperature, pH and NPK value of the medium were recorded. Different results were obtained in different combinations of three waste mixtures. Usually dung slurry (50 %) is sprinkled for maintaining proper moisture in the vermicomposting medium. The best results were obtained in 5 : 1 : 2 mixture of vegetable waste, paper waste and soil-sand mixture with a maximum increase in worm population and worm biomass. Analysis of vermicompost revealed maximum nitrogen (1. 94 %), potassium (1. 19 %) and phosphorus (1. 11 %) content in this mixture. Thus it is concluded that vegetable waste can be converted into high quality vermicompost in an environment friendly manner. Promotion of vermicomposting of household waste will help in environmental conservation, organic farming and sustainable development...|$|R

The authors conducted a waste generation survey and a waste composition survey for 309 stalls/vendors in five markets by 17 business categories for 10 consecutive days. The waste generation rates by stall/vendor and by floor area were assessed in three waste categories: general waste, recyclable, and food residues. The general waste that would be sent to a landfill site was classified into 10 physical categories and 77 sub-categories.

40|$|This {{experiment}} was objected {{to study the}} in vitro rumen fermentability on the processed vegetable waste. The study was accomplished by two experiments. The first {{experiment was}} aimed to select the best processing for vegetable waste. The vegetable <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> a traditional <b>market</b> in Semarang City were fermented using Lactobacillus bulgaricus and rumen bolus with cassava waste, rice bran, and maize grain as additives. In each combined treatment of innoculant and additive was fermented in anaerob conditon for 0, 1, 2, and 3 weeks, respectively. In each combined treatment of innoculant, additive, and fermentation time was analyzed for its moisture, crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber content. Among the combined treatments were then selected the best processing for vegetable waste ac-cording {{to the use of}} L. bulgaricus and rumen bolus, respectively. The selection was determined {{on the basis of a}} numerical score for each parameter observed. The results showed that the combination of rice bran of additive and one week of fermentation was the best for fermentation using L. bulgaricus (SSLB). Likewise, the the combination of rice bran of additive and two weeks of fermentation was the best for fermentation using rumen bolus (SSBR). In the second experiment, the processed vegetable <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> the result of first experiment (SSLB and SSBR) were compared to Pennisetum purpureum (RG), unprocessed vegetable <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> the garbage collecting terminal in Semarang City (SSTPA), and unprocessed vegetable <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> traditional <b>market</b> (SSPT) on the basis of their in vitro rumen fermentability. Parameters of the in vitro rumen fermentability were dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility, rumen production of VFA and N-NH 3. The test of in vitro rumen fermentability was conducted using cattle rumen liquid and artificial saliva. The results showed that the DM and OM digestibility of RG was lower (P< 0, 05) than that of SSPT, but there was no siginificant different among SSTPA, SSLB, and RG in their DM and OM digestibility. The in vitro rumen VFA production among RG, SSTPA, SSLB, and SSBR were not different significantly. The in vitro rumen VFA production of SSPT was higher (P< 0, 05) than that of RG, SSTPA, SSLB, and SSBR. The in vitro rumen NH 3 production among SSPT, SSLB, and SSBR were not different significantly. The in vitro rumen NH 3 production of RG and SSTPA were lower (P< 0, 05) than that of SSPT, SSLB, and SSBR. The fermen-tation using L. bulgaricus with rice bran for one week was appropriate in processing the vegetable waste.

It was fed by the residual biomass (agriculture residues and zootechnical wastes) produced by a farm located in the countryside of Perugia, Italy. The successful experience allowed the research group to design an upgrade of the existing plant, making it replicable to every communitarian activity such as Conference Halls, Schools, Condos, where organic biomass is produced as <b>waste.</b> Biomass recovery <b>from</b> <b>markets,</b> canteens and little food companies represents {{an opportunity for the}} installation of new residues-powered plants, achieving the production of both electricity and thermal energy for house heating and industrial processes. The collected biomass could also be integrated with pruning or residual biomass from the maintenance of the green and the neighbouring municipal wastewater from a septic tank. The simplicity, automaticity, and the cost-effectiveness of the plant, together with the incentives from electric energy injection to the grid, made the investment payable in a few years, allowing the operator to gain from renewable sources. Little sized biogas plants solves the problem of harvesting and disposal of the organic waste, reducing its transportation costs and producing green energy. The paper presents the preliminary design of the plant...|$|R
