5|$|In 1919 a Large Black sow was Supreme Champion at Smithfield (UK), {{and at the}} Royal Show {{that year}} 121 Large Blacks were entered, {{more than any other}} breed. Popularity of the breed peaked in the 1920s, however, and after World War II, {{population}} numbers declined as farmers began to favour pig breeds that <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in intensive indoor farming. The breed association was merged with the National Pig Breeders Association (later the British Pig Association) in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The novel's delayed {{publication}} was {{a result}} of Balzac's active social life. He spent many nights dining at the homes of friends, including novelist Eugène Sue and his mistress Olympe Pélissier, as well as the feminist writer George Sand and her lover Jules Sandeau. Balzac and Pélissier had a brief affair, and she became the first lover with whom he appeared in public. Eventually he removed himself from Paris by staying with friends in the suburbs, where he committed himself to finishing the work. In late spring he allowed Sand to read a nearly-finished manuscript; she enjoyed it and predicted it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, whilst his county form on overgrassed pitches {{was back}} to {{something}} close to his best, on the less grassy surfaces in the First Test against the West Indies his bowling lacked its old venom, and he was surprisingly replaced by the veteran Derek Shackleton {{for the rest of}} the series – a move criticised heavily in the press because it was known fast bowlers <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> at Lord's. A highlight that year came when Statham took five wickets in the first-ever Gillette Cup match against Leicestershire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of Hogwarts, the four founders {{hand-picked}} students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in Slytherin in the first book, but ultimately selecting Gryffindor after Harry asks it not to put him in Slytherin.|$|E

25|$|During Park's {{sophomore year}} of high school he sent a video of himself singing and playing the piano to {{prominent}} talent management agencies which led to several offers. Park, who initially wanted to be a singer-songwriter, later changed his career path after a suggestion that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> acting. He graduated from Shinmok High School in 2012, and enrolled at Myongji University as a Musical Theater undergraduate in March 2014. Despite his acting career, Park maintained an active collegiate life and represented his university's cultural overseas exchange program in Europe. He has also directed a one-act play based on Anton Chekov's works, and served as music director in his graduating class's production of Hairspray.|$|E
25|$|GrandPré has {{illustrated}} {{all of the}} American {{editions of}} the Harry Potter novels. She {{was one of the}} few people who were able to read the Harry Potter books before they were released to the general public. When she received each new book, she read the story through once, highlighting descriptions that she felt <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> as an illustration. She then created various sketches as ideas for the cover and chapter art, before sending her favorites to the editors to decide which should appear in the final publication. GrandPré devises her images after reading the scripts for the books, and does not collaborate with or receive input from J.K. Rowling, although the two have met. Her artwork for the final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.|$|E

For Preston's visit to Coventry Road the following weekend, the club applied for a licence to sell alcohol within the ground, as it was the only First Division club without such a licence.

500|$|Barr's {{campaign}} manager Russ Verney sent a fundraising memorandum on May 19 that included his projections for the campaign, and compared Barr favorably to Ross Perot. His predictions included {{participation in the}} nationally televised debates in October 2008 and a popular vote total of 19%. The manager commented that this was [...] "no ordinary presidential campaign" [...] and that Barr <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> because [...] "America is swamped in Libertarian information." [...] May 18, 2008 Rasmussen polling reports showed Barr at 6% nationally in a four-way race with Barack Obama, John McCain, Ralph Nader. He led Nader by 2%. A breakdown of Barr's support showed that 7% of Republicans, 5% of Democrats and 5% of unaffiliated voters supported his campaign. The report concluded that most Americans {{did not have enough}} information about Barr to form an opinion.|$|E

500|$|In 1962 he {{attended}} an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda.

Among the topics of discussion {{was an attempt to}} determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not [...] "a very significant question", and that scholars <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond.|$|E

500|$|In August 1865 Nelson {{attempted}} to resurrect the institute following the war, and he submitted an advertisement to the Civilian & Telegraph newspaper in Cumberland, Maryland, {{in which he}} billed the institute as [...] "A Male and Female Boarding and Day School". The institute opened on the first Monday in September in 1865 for its fall and winter session. According to Nelson in the advertisement, [...] "parents desiring for their children a sound English, Classical and Mathematical Education <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> to patronize this School." [...] Student education was divided into three levels: the Lowest Grade level for $10 for a five-month session, Intermediate level for $15, and the Highest level for $20. Latin and Greek each cost $5 additional per quarter. Boarding at the school cost $3 per week; however, laundry, fuel, and lighting {{were not included in}} this fee. Music lessons were also taught [...] "at Professor's charges".|$|E
500|$|In 1865, Olympia brewer Isaac Wood {{imported}} some hop roots {{from the}} United Kingdom, hopeful that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> in the Pacific Northwest. As hops, used to flavor beer, were not then grown locally, {{the cost of}} transport from Britain or New York made his beer expensive, and he hoped Puget Sound-area farmers would grow hops and supply him. [...] He {{was a friend of}} Jacob Meeker, and gave him the roots to grow. Jacob passed some of them on to Ezra. The plants grew extremely well, {{and at the end of}} the season, the Meekers earned $185 from selling Wood the crop. Such a sum was rarely seen in the Puyallup Valley at that time, and a hop-growing boom promptly began. Ezra Meeker, with his head start, was able to repeatedly expand operations, he eventually had [...] of hop-growing lands. He also built one of the first hop-drying kilns in the valley.

[...] Sherman believed that California Chrome <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> running on grass, and it also would open up a variety of potential races to enter in 2015. [...] He was the morning line favorite, with his toughest competitor viewed as Lexie Lou, a filly who defeated colts to win Canada's equivalent of the Kentucky Derby, the Queen's Plate. California Chrome won by two lengths, and the Canadian filly was second. With the win, California Chrome earned four Grade I races for the year and was the only horse in the United States to have Grade I wins in 2014 on both dirt and turf tracks.
