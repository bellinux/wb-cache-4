5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the player's score multiplier by one, up to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E
25|$|In the aldol reaction, {{the metal}} enolates of ketones, esters, amides, and {{carboxylic}} acids <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> aldehydes to form β-hydroxycarbonyl compounds (aldols). Acid or base-catalyzed dehydration will then lead to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The {{combination of these}} two steps {{is known as the}} aldol condensation.|$|E
25|$|This {{chemical}} is an inhalational anaesthetic studied only {{in animals}} in 1967, and toxicology investigations did not acknowledge this fact. All hydrofluorocarbon inhaled anaesthetic agents have smooth muscle relaxing properties, so the propellant gas produced by pMDIs using HFA134a and HFA227ea (which has no anaesthetic activity) <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> beta2-agonist bronchodilating drugs from that inhaler.|$|E

25|$|Both {{countries}} {{signed a}} defence deal worth $2.9 billion during President Putin's visit to India in December 2012. The 42 new Sukhois, {{to be produced}} under licence by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics, <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the 230 Sukhois earlier contracted from Russia. Overall, the price tag for the 272 Sukhois - three of the over 170 inducted till now have crashed - stands at over $12 billion. The medium-lift Mi-17 V5 helicopters (59 for IAF and 12 for home ministry/BSF) <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the 80 such choppers already being inducted under a $1.34 billion deal inked in 2008. The value of India's defence projects with Russia will further zoom north after the imminent inking of the final design contract for the joint development of a futuristic stealth fifth-generation fighter. This R contract is itself pegged at US$11 billion, to be shared equally by the two countries. So if India inducts over 200 of these 5th Gen fighters, as it hopes to do from 2022 onwards, the overall cost of this gigantic project for India will come to around US$35 billion since each of the jets will come for upwards of US$100 million at least.|$|E

The Harbin to Hamburg 15-day train journey <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> over-land freight capacity and increase transportation redundancy. China is already moving freight by rail to Europe from Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Yiwu and Suzhou. Expectations that deeper economic relationship with Europe {{will lead to}} China becoming a responsible stakeholder in global governance is complemented by observations that China is progressively moving sea-based trade with Europe to land-based alternatives.|$|E

Most commonly inhibitors <b>will</b> be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a biocide <b>will</b> be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems. The required chemicals <b>will</b> be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the fluid system by use of a dosing pot; a multi-valved chamber in which the chemical can be added, and then introduced to the fluid system in a controlled manner.|$|R

25|$|The problem {{statement}} is therefore that the alleles in question {{are not particularly}} beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows {{for more than one}} gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the cost of substitution.|$|E
25|$|HIV/AIDS {{will drive}} up social and {{healthcare}} costs in India and China, but the broader {{economic and political}} impact {{is likely to be}} readily absorbed by the huge populations of these countries. We do not believe the disease will pose a fundamental threat through 2010 to their status as major regional players, but it <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the complex problems faced by their leaders. The more HIV/AIDS spreads among young, educated, urban populations, the greater the economic cost of the disease will be for these countries, given the impact on, and the need for, skilled labor.|$|E
25|$|Retirement of the Baby Boom generation—which by 2030 is {{projected}} to increase enrollment to more than 80 million {{as the number of}} workers per enrollee declines from 3.7 to 2.4—and rising overall health care costs pose substantial financial challenges to the program. Medicare spending {{is projected}} to increase from $523 billion in 2010 to just over $1 trillion by 2022. Baby-boomers' health is also an important factor: 20% have five or more chronic conditions, which <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the future cost of health care (www.cms.gov, 2012). In response to these financial challenges, Congress made substantial cuts to future payouts to providers as part of PPACA in 2010 and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) and policymakers have offered a number of additional competing proposals to reduce Medicare costs further.|$|E

After a further interval of [...] the reflected step arrives at the generator end and the condition of double voltage and zero current will pertain there also as well as all {{along the length of the}} line.

500|$|Made on a {{production}} budget of 380 million, the film immediately recovered 430 million, {{slightly more than}} its entire budget, before its release. This included 220 million from satellite rights, 80 million from music rights, and 130 million from distribution sales in territories other than Mumbai and Delhi, where the film was distributed directly by Eros. Bollywood Hungama noted that [...] "the revenue generated from these territories, besides Home Video, <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the profits of the film". The film's box office revenue on its opening day was 80 million. Anjaana Anjaani made over 257million at the domestic box office and a further 1.7 million from overseas, for a worldwide opening weekend of over 382 million. During its theatrical run, the film grossed over 544 million in India, and over 3.1 million in the overseas market, {{for a total of}} 685 million. The film was a box office success.|$|E

500|$|While {{playing the}} game, an {{extended}} guitar neck is shown vertically {{on the screen}} (the frets horizontal), often called the [...] "note highway", and as the song progresses, colored markers or [...] "gems" [...] indicating notes travel down the screen {{in time with the}} music; the note colors and positions match those of the five fret keys on the guitar controller. Once the note(s) reach the bottom, the player must play the indicated note(s) by holding down the correct fret button(s) and hitting the strumming bar in order to score points. Success or failure will cause the on-screen Rock Meter to change, showing how well the player is playing (denoted by red, yellow, and green sections). Should the Rock Meter drop below the red section, the song will automatically end, with the player booed off the stage by the audience. Successful note hits <b>will</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the player's score, and by hitting a long series of consecutive successful note hits, the player can increase their score multiplier. There is a window of time for hitting each note, similar to other rhythm games such as Dance Dance Revolution, but unlike these games, scoring in Guitar Hero is not affected by accuracy; as long as the note is hit within that window, the player receives the same number of points.|$|E
