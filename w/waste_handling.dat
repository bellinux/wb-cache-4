25|$|While {{nuclear power}} {{does not produce}} {{significant}} carbon dioxide in generation (though the construction, mining, <b>waste</b> <b>handling</b> and disposal, and decommissioning do generate some carbon emissions), it raises other environmental and security concerns. Despite this, it has enormous potential for generating electricity, when it is taken into consideration that uranium could last up to a hundred years. However, even with changes to the planning system to speed applications, there are doubts over whether the necessary timescale could be met, and over the financial viability of nuclear power with present oil and gas prices. With no nuclear plants having been constructed since Sizewell B in 1995, there {{are also likely to}} be capacity issues within the native nuclear industry. The existing privatised nuclear supplier, British Energy, had been in financial trouble in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{components}} of anthropogenic emissions are fertilized agricultural soils and livestock manure (42%), runoff and leaching of fertilizers (25%), biomass burning (10%), fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (10%), biological degradation of other nitrogen-containing atmospheric emissions (9%), and human sewage (5%). [...] Agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through soil cultivation, {{the use of}} nitrogen fertilisers, and animal <b>waste</b> <b>handling.</b> These activities stimulate naturally-occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil can be challenging to measure as they vary markedly over time and space, {{and the majority of}} a year's emissions may occur when conditions are favorable during [...] "hot moments" [...] and/or at favorable locations known as [...] "hotspots".|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the logistics of}} hard domestic wastes, modeling and predicting their accumulation and handling. The morphological composition of hard domestic wastes in Zhytomyr according to the season has been defined. The influence of various factors on the morphological features of the wastes has been studied. The seasonal morphological composition of the wastes both in the containers and in the dump yard has been analyzed. Possibilities to use the offered method of hard domestic wastes accumulation in Zhytomyr dump yard have been considered. The aim of this work was to improve the hard domestic <b>wastes</b> <b>handling</b> through its modeling and predicting wastes accumulation, to decrease their harmful {{effect on the environment}} and to ensure environmental protection and to use the wastes as secondary resources knowing the composition of hard domestic wastes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 22, 2016 - June 22, 2018 Small and medium-sized enterprises that are characterized by high-mix, low-volume, and highly variable production operations often have unstructured material movement processes that are prone to material <b>handling</b> <b>wastes.</b> These sub-optimal material handling systems are oftentimes a result of small and medium-sized enterprise's limited resources. Current tools to assist organizations in reducing material <b>handling</b> <b>wastes</b> are resource intensive, complex, or too vague. Material <b>handling</b> <b>wastes</b> are defined in this research as: a) inappropriate material handling, b) operator search time, and c) inefficient forklift routing. To help {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} reduce material <b>handling</b> <b>wastes</b> it is hypothesized that tailored visual management systems 1) can be designed from the analysis of three material <b>handling</b> <b>wastes,</b> and 2) can yield a low resource intensive solution to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing material <b>handling</b> <b>wastes.</b> In order to test these hypotheses, a methodology to design an ad-hoc material handling system is developed, tested via a case study, and validated via two alternate scenarios. Results show that ad-hoc visual management systems can be designed from low resource intensive analysis and are capable of increasing the efficiency of in-house material movements in small and medium-sized enterprises. The resulting methodology is expected to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing in-house material <b>handling</b> <b>wastes</b> using visual management systems...|$|R
