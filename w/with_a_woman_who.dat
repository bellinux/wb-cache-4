At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if the drug is working.|$|E

Nora, however, wants to go on with the planned process and is able to change Dr. Bowers' mind.|$|E
25|$|Then there's the odd, of course, {{fact that}} he had a very long love affair <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> he owned, who he {{inherited}} from his father-in-law, who was his wife's half-sister, and produced several children by her, whose descendants have mainly been brought up on the white side of the color line. So in a strange way, his own patrimony disproves his own belief that there couldn't be coexistence between black and white Americans.|$|E

25|$|The vǫlur {{were known}} for their art of seduction, {{which was one of}} the reasons why they were {{considered}} dangerous.

25|$|The Social Suicide Bomber (Raskopoulos) is an awkward-looking {{man in a}} {{burgundy}} {{blazer and}} salmon-pink shirt who is summoned {{by people who are}} stuck in unpleasant social situations - such as an unattractive man flirting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> doesn't want that kind of attention - by pressing a large red button. He drives away the unwanted person with banal comments or bizarre actions, like demonstrating his pterodactyl impersonation. Unfortunately, with that person gone, the Social Suicide Bomber then often turns his sights to the person who called him, creating a situation that was more awkward than the one to begin with.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} surreal short films in the show, {{containing}} minimal dialogue and apparently set in a dystopian future society. It features a man (McCulloch) {{who works at a}} draconian sausage factory and falls in love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> works there kissing the boxes so they have the company's lipstick logo. Too nervous to talk to her, the man, who had stolen some sausages for his deranged, sausage-obsessed father (Thompson), leaves them on her doorstep anonymously.

25|$|For lay Buddhists, marital {{fidelity}} {{is traditionally}} {{considered to be}} part of Right Action, part of the Eightfold Path. Specifically, it is considered part of the avoidance of sexual misconduct (kamesu miccha-cara veramani in Pali), which defines who is an illicit or inappropriate sexual partner for a man or a woman, depending on their marital status, age, etc. Different Buddhist-influenced cultures have interpreted the specifics of this prohibition differently with respect to practices like multiple marriage and concubinage; in 2015, for example, a Japanese court ruled that paying for prostitution did not constitute adultery, though traditional rules of sexual misconduct forbid a man from having sex <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> might be obliged to him for financial reasons.|$|E
25|$|Tribes {{often have}} {{initiation}}s. The initiation {{done in the}} Bapedi tribe of South Africa is normally regarded as a stage where a boy is to be taught manhood and a girl to be taught womanhood. In many African tribes, initiation involves circumcision/genital mutilation of males and sometimes circumcision/genital mutilation of females as well. Initiation is considered necessary for the individual {{to be regarded as}} a full member of the tribe. Otherwise, the individual may not be allowed to participate in ceremonies or even in social rituals such as marriage. A man {{will not be allowed to}} marry or have any special relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> did not go to an initiation, because she is not considered to be a woman.|$|E
25|$|Both {{films were}} box office failures, and Dreyer {{did not make}} another movie until 1943. Denmark was by now under Nazi occupation, and his Day of Wrath had as its theme the {{paranoia}} surrounding witch hunts {{in the seventeenth century}} in a strongly theocratic culture. With this work, Dreyer established the style that would mark his sound films: careful compositions, stark monochrome cinematography, and very long takes. In the more than a decade before his next full-length feature film, Dreyer made two documentaries. In 1955, he made Ordet (The Word) based on the play of the same name by Kaj Munk. The film combines a love story with a conflict of faith. Dreyer's last film was 1964's Gertrud. Although seen by some as a lesser film than its predecessors, it is a fitting close to Dreyer's career, as it deals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who,</b> through the tribulations of her life, never expresses regret for her choices.|$|E

Toward the end of the series, Helen reveals she never broke off the engagement. She had figured he was gone after he was skirted off to Burma {{in the wake of a}} coup d'etat to salvage major investments he had in the company. He was then placed under house arrest by the military junta. Upon his release, Davis returns to see Helen, but while she is trying to work up the courage to tell him she has married someone else, Davis announces that he will be unable to marry her, having fallen in love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> worked for the State Department and had risked her life to secure his release.|$|E

The three then take the Predator back to Zamaron, however when Carol discovers the intentions of the Zamarons, she argues that the Guardians' technology that the Zamarons-based the battery on can be powered by the ambient love in the universe and refused to deliver the Predator. Upon hearing Carol's words, the Zamaron Queen Aga'po used the last of her life force to charge the Central Power Battery, leaving her title of Queen of the Star Sapphires to Carol.|$|E
