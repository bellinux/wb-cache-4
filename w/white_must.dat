5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, <b>White</b> <b>must</b> {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E
5|$|Western Middle School in Russiaville faced {{enormous}} pressure from many parents and faculty to deny White {{from the campus}} after his diagnosis became widely known. In the school of 360 total students, 117 parents and 50 teachers signed a petition encouraging school leaders to ban Ryan from school. Due to the widespread fear and ignorance of AIDS, the principal and later the school board succumbed to this pressure and prohibited re-admittance. The White family filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision. The Whites initially filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. The court, however, declined {{to hear the case}} until administrative appeals had been resolved. On November 25, an Indiana Department of Education officer ruled that the school must follow the Indiana Board of Health guidelines and that Ryan <b>White</b> <b>must</b> be allowed to attend school.|$|E

But first, <b>whites</b> <b>must</b> {{see how they}} benefit from diversity, and, second, <b>whites</b> <b>must</b> take simple steps toward integration that may, in turn, reveal to whites their desire to become more fully integrated.

2500|$|Since Butler’s novel {{challenges}} {{readers to}} come to terms with slavery and its legacy, one significant meaning of the term [...] "kindred" [...] is the United States’ history of miscegenation and its denial by official discourses.

25|$|Whereas chess opening theory changes frequently, {{giving way}} to middlegame {{positions}} that fall {{in and out of}} popularity, endgame theory always remains constant. Many people have composed endgame studies, endgame positions which are solved by finding a win for White when there is no obvious way to win, or a draw when it seems <b>White</b> <b>must</b> lose.|$|E
25|$|White tried 31.Rh6, {{but could}} not avoid the {{perpetual}}: 31...Rxb7 32.Qxb7 Qd1+ 33.Kh2 Rh5+ 34.Rxh5 34.Kg3!? (hoping for 34...Rxh6?? 35.Qxg7#) is met by 34...Rg5+! and <b>White</b> <b>must</b> repeat moves with 35.Kh2! Rh5+, since 35.Kh3?? Qh1#; 35.Kh4?? Qg4#; and 35.Kf4?? Qg4# all get mated. 34...Qxh5+ 35.Kg3 Qg5+ 36.Kf3 Qf5+ ½–½ since White cannot escape the perpetual check.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} diagram below, <b>White</b> <b>must</b> prevent Black from playing at a, and does this with 1 {{in the second}} diagram. Black can capture the three stones in White 1's group by playing at b. Black does this with Black 2 in the third diagram. White may {{recapture}} Black 2 by playing at a again, because the resulting position, shown in the fourth diagram, has not occurred previously. It differs from the position after White 1 {{by the absence of}} the two marked white stones.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} diagram below, it is White's turn. <b>White</b> <b>must</b> prevent Black from {{connecting}} the marked stones {{to the others}} by playing at a. The second diagram shows White's move. White is threatening to kill the marked black stones by playing at b. In the third diagram, Black plays at b to prevent this, capturing White 1. However, by playing at a again, White can capture Black 2's group. This is not barred by the ko rule because the resulting position, shown in the fourth diagram, differs from the one after White 1 {{by the absence of}} the marked black stones. This kind of capture is called a snapback.|$|E
500|$|Another reasonable-looking move is 4.Qd4 as {{it protects}} the e5-pawn and attacks the Ng4. However, [...] "the problem for White in the Budapest is that natural moves {{often lead to}} disaster". Best for Black is the gambit 4...d6 5.exd6 Nc6! 6.Qd1 Bxd6, when the natural 7.Nf3?? is an error because of 7...Nxf2! 8.Kxf2 Bg3+ winning the queen. <b>White</b> <b>must</b> develop quietly with moves like Nc3/Nf3/e3/Be2, {{allowing}} Black to find active positions for his pieces with 0-0/Be6/Qe7/Rfd8, and preparing several sacrificial ideas on e3 or f2, with excellent attacking possibilities. Similar to 4.Qd4 is 4.Qd5 when after 4...Nc6 White can seize the last opportunity to return to calm waters with 5.Bf4 Bb4+ 6.Nc3 which will transpose in the Rubinstein line, or he can try 5.Nf3 d6 6.exd6 Be6 7.d7+ Bxd7 when Black's lead in development compensates for the pawn.|$|E
500|$|Rowson {{argues that}} Black also has several {{advantage}}s. First, [...] "White's alleged advantage {{is also a}} kind of obligation {{to play for a}} win, and Black can often use this to his advantage." [...] Second, [...] "White's 'extra move' can be a burden, and sometimes White finds himself in a mild form of zugzwang ('Zugzwang Lite')." [...] Third, although White begins the game with the initiative, if [...] "Black retains a flexible position with good reactive possibilities, this initiative can be absorbed and often passes over to Black." [...] Fourth, [...] "The fact that White moves before Black often gives Black useful information". Suba likewise argues that White's advantage is actually less than a move, since <b>White</b> <b>must</b> tip his hand first, allowing Black to react to White's plans. Suba writes, [...] "In terms of the mathematical games theory, chess is a game of complete information, and Black's information is always greater—by one move!" ...|$|E
