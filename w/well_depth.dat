25|$|Initial {{difficulties}} in spherical electron confinement {{led to the}} 2005 research project's termination. However, Bussard reported a fusion rate of 109 per second running D-D fusion reactions at only 12.5 kV (based on detecting nine neutrons in five tests, giving a wide confidence interval). He stated that the fusion rate achieved by WB-6 was roughly 100,000 times greater than what Farnsworth achieved at similar <b>well</b> <b>depth</b> and drive conditions. By comparison, researchers at University of Wisconsin–Madison reported a neutron rate of up to 5×109 per second at voltages of 120 kV from an electrostatic fusor without magnetic fields.|$|E
2500|$|On the topside, {{the single}} steel {{drilling}} caisson has a standard 20,000 square feet land rig. The drilling mast and substructure have a rated capacity of 1,300,000lbs {{and can be}} skidded to drill a well to the maximum depth of [...] through {{any of the four}} moon pools. Internally, the drilling unit can hold enough supplies to drill three to five wells depending on the <b>well</b> <b>depth.</b> In addition to drilling equipment, the topside includes two cranes, a helicopter platform, and accommodation for 90 workers.|$|E
2500|$|Funding became {{tighter and}} tighter. According to Bussard, [...] "The funds were clearly {{needed for the}} more {{important}} War in Iraq." [...] An extra $900k of Office of Naval Research funding allowed the program to continue long enough to reach WB-6 testing in November 2005. WB-6 had rings with circular cross sections that space apart at the joints. This reduced the metal surface area unprotected by magnetic fields. These changes dramatically improved system performance, leading to more electron recirculation and better electron confinement, in a progressively tighter core. This machine produced a fusion rate of 109 per second. This {{is based on a}} total of nine neutrons in five tests, giving a wide confidence interval. Drive voltage on the WB-6 tests was about 12.5 kV, with a resulting potential <b>well</b> <b>depth</b> of about 10 kV. Thus deuterium ions could have a maximum of 10 keV of kinetic energy in the center. By comparison, a Fusor running deuterium fusion at 10 kV would produce a fusion rate almost too small to detect. Hirsch reported a fusion rate this high only by driving his machine with a 150 kV drop between the inside and outside cages. Hirsch also used deuterium and tritium, a much easier fuel to fuse, because it has a higher nuclear cross section.|$|E

In the Mott insulator phase, atoms will be {{trapped in the}} potential minima and cannot move freely, which is similar to the electrons in an insulator.

40|$|Approximately 500 {{water wells}} having driller 2 ̆ 7 s lithologic logs were plottedin Boone, Carroll, and Madison Counties, Arkansas. Three {{aquifers}} {{were found to}} be used by the rural residents and smaller communities. The most shallow of these is the Mississippian Boone-St. Joe aquifer. This aquifer is generally the least productive having a range of. 25 to 60 gpm but a median productivity of only 5 gpm. <b>Well</b> <b>depths</b> for the Boone-St. Joe range from 46 to 464 ft. and have a median depth of 225 ft. The Boone-St. Joe aquifer is unconfined to semi-confined and yields sufficient quantities of water only when there is an adequate saturated thickness (generally 3 ̆e 100 ft.) and/or a fracture or water-filled cave is intersected. The next aquifer is the first sand below the Chattanooga Shale which can be composed on one to three of the following sandstones: upper Everton, Clifty, and/or Sylamore. The range in yield for this newly designated aquifer is 1 to 70 gpm with a median productivity of 10 gpm. <b>Well</b> <b>depths</b> for the aquifer range from 150 to 824 ft. with a median depth of 460 feet. An isopach map was prepared for this sandstone aquifer zone. There is a rapid thinning trend to the north from 250 ft in central Madison County to 0 ft near the Missouri border. If there is insufficiency or permeability of this aquifer, residents must drill deeper to the Cotter Dolomite. The Cotter-Jefferson City Dolomite is the next aquifer below the Sylamore-Clifty-Everton aquifer. This aquifer zone has a range in yield of 1. 5 to 200 gpm and a median yield of 15 gpm. <b>Well</b> <b>depths</b> range from 130 to 1010 ft. with a median depth of 475 feet. A statistical correlation procedure was made among well yield (gpm), photo-lineament proximity, and regolith thickness for all these aquifers in Boone County.

A strong relationship between lineament proximity and yield exists when the aquifers are combined but not for each of the individual aquifers...|$|R
