50|$|Superscale is Top Gear's {{venture into}} the 1:24 scale market where larger {{versions}} of Australian cars are handmade containing over 200 pieces. These models include opening doors, bonnets and boot lids, working steering. Some models even have working <b>window</b> <b>winders</b> allowing the door windows to be wound up or down.|$|R
5000|$|A faster edition {{called the}} 111S, {{named after the}} Lotus type-number of the Elise (Type 111), was {{introduced}} in early 1999 and had a VVC Rover K-Series engine with a modified head and VVT technology, producing a declared [...] rather than the standard Rover 1.8 L K-series [...] inline-four unit, along with a closer ratio manual gearbox and lower ratio final drive. It also had more padding in the seats. The 111S had headlamp covers, rear spoiler, cross drilled brake discs, alloy <b>window</b> <b>winders</b> and a six-spoke road wheel design.|$|R
50|$|Both {{aircraft}} {{were constructed}} as pure gliders {{and then later}} motorized {{with the addition of}} a twin-cylinder, in-line Yamaha snowmobile engine. The engine is mounted behind the wing spar on a pylon that retracts forward into a bay closed by two doors. The power is transmitted through a belt-drive to a two-bladed propeller. The pylon can be deployed in eight seconds and uses the electric motor from a Ford Thunderbird <b>window</b> <b>winder.</b> The Yamaha powerplant gives a take-off roll of 1000 ft at an elevation of 500 ft and produces a climb rate of 350 ft/min m/s.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious {{radiator}} grill and bumper bar changes, {{there were other}} less obvious changes that {{took place during the}} Midgets production run. The first cars assembled in 1967 were wired positive earth, had thinly cast engine blocks requiring nitrated crank shafts to provide extra rigidity. Later engines blocks were cast with thicker walls. Other changes were to negative earth wiring and alternator, chunckier boot lock handle, internal door latch handles, and quarter light window handles. Plastic <b>window</b> <b>winder</b> and internal door pull handles. Crossflow radiators running at higher pressures. The differential ratio was also changed to 3.9 some time during 1970.|$|R
25|$|Beckett {{told police}} the group {{travelled}} to Tathra Beach and {{spent some time}} there {{before returning to the}} camp site at White Rock. On the road leading to the camp site, Camilleri became disturbed at the car bottoming out on the uneven gravel road and became angry at the girls. The rear doors of the vehicle had been previously locked using the vehicle's child locks and there were no <b>window</b> <b>winders,</b> preventing the rear doors from being opened by passengers inside. Camilleri produced a knife and told the girls they would be stabbed if they tried to escape. Beckett also produced a knife and went along with Camilleri in threatening the girls.|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} for the car’s design again went to Frua of Moncalieri, {{with the proviso that}} as far as possible they should avoid the requirement to design new components where existing parts might be obtained from other manufacturers. The resulting design, therefore, featured, among its many “borrowed” components headlights from a Setra bus, <b>window</b> <b>winder</b> mechanisms from a Mercedes-Benz 230SL and the door locks of a Porsche 911. The bodywork was built by hand, with moving parts such as the doors and bonnets as well as the chrome trim stripe at top of the grille, being made to fit each individual body. All such parts thus carry the chassis number of each car and mean that they are not directly interchangeable between cars.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{requirement}} and concept model {{based on a}} functional decomposition of mechanical systems. It is an object-oriented approach to integrate {{the representation of the}} design artefact and the design activity, through the decisions made during the design evolution. The requirements co-evolve simultaneously with the formation of the conceptual layout, through the opportunity to alter between function and physical/abstract solutions. This approach structures the design requirements and concepts {{in such a way that}} it supports the ability to document their sources, to allow for validation and verifications of both requirements and design solutions. First, the proposed model is presented from a theoretical viewpoint. Secondly, a methodology for modelling requirements and concepts in an object-oriented fashion is discussed. Finally, the model is implemented in METIS software and tested in a case study of an electric <b>window</b> <b>winder</b> on a truck door...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} design {{grippers}} to grasp a family object, {{the development of}} this method is motivated by the desire to guide engineer to choose contact points on accessible regions on the workpiece. The method described here consists in a geometrical accessibility analysis by using collision technics on objects surface. Keywords : Grippers Design, Geometrical Accessibility Analysis, CAD-CAM Systems. 1. Introduction Grippers are key components of robotized assembly systems. In car industry for instance, parts to be manipulated by the same device are often variable in their geometry. This is specially true for <b>window</b> <b>winder,</b> exhaust pipes, etc [...] .. As a consequence, grippers have to be flexible, that means able to handle all the variants of the part family. Flexible gripper design is basically a complex problem. The design process has to take into account simultaneously various constraints : geometric accessibility, size and the geometry of the parts to be manipulated, their mechanical [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} Prairies were innovative vehicles - featuring no B-pillar between {{the front and}} rear doors (instead the interlocking front and sliding rear doors locked onto both the floor and roof of the vehicle); front seatbelts mounted on the doors (excluding the US versions) that facilitated a totally unimpeded side entrance; front seats that could be slid {{all the way to the}} front of the passenger compartment and fully reclined; rear seats that could not only be folded away conventionally, but could also be reclined fully to make a double bed (in combination with the front seats); rear <b>window</b> <b>winders</b> that folded into themselves (to prevent catching when the doors were slid open); tailgate that opened to the floor of the luggage compartment (the center section of the rear bumper was mounted on the tailgate); optional front-facing third row of seats. This type of entry was later introduced on the Toyota Isis, but only on the passenger side.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was also much modified over that of earlier cars. There {{was a new}} dashboard with large speedometer and tachometer instruments in twin binnacles closer to the driver's line of sight. The instruments were mounted at a more conventional angle, avoiding the reflections caused by the upward angled flat dash of earlier cars. Conversely, auxiliary instruments were moved to angled bezels in the centre console, further from the driver's line of sight than before. The new seats introduced adjustable headrests which merged with {{the top of the}} seat when fully down. The <b>window</b> <b>winder</b> levers, the door release levers and the quarterlight vent knobs were also restyled. The remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the door lock striker, was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} was well-appointed with full instrumentation {{in a wooden}} dashboard, wooden door cappings, adjustable steering column and comfortable seats with ventilated PVC upholstery. There was through-flow ventilation with outlets under the rear roof lip. The car was fairly roomy, and aside from a slightly baulky gearchange, easy to drive with very reasonable performance. Standard equipment was generous and included thick carpeting but no heated backlight. Although not reclining, the front seats were remarkably versatile and could be easily adjusted for height and rake. The steering column was adjustable not only up and down but {{back and forth as}} well. From a safety angle the door handles were recessed and could not be caught on clothing and the (awkward to operate) <b>window</b> <b>winders</b> were spring-loaded and similarly recessed. The instrument panel had a speedometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, ammeter and a comprehensive cluster of warning lights arranged in a [...] "pie chart" [...] formation. The rear seat had a centre armrest which could be folded up when not in use.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the muscle}} car market took shape, Ford {{introduced}} a Ford Fairlane in 1963 few Fairlane two door hard tops prepared for drag racing during the 1963 season. These cars were running the 289 {{is known that}} ran the 260 and {{there may have been}} more and were set up in the Tubing works plant that built the special cars for Ford racing. These soon evolved into the [...] "Thunderbolts" [...] for 1964. Thunderbolt for drag racing for 1964, was a heavily modified two door post to incorporate Ford's new 427 CID (7.0 L) V8 race engine with two four-barrel carburetors on a high-riser manifold, ram-air through the openings left by deleting the inboard headlights, equal-length headers, trunk-mounted battery, fiberglass hood, doors, fenders, and front bumper, acrylic glass windows, and other lightweight options, including deleted rear-door <b>window</b> <b>winders,</b> carpeting, radio, sealant, sun visors, armrests, jack, lug wrench, heater, soundproofing, and passenger-side windshield wiper. The cars wore Fairlane 500 trim, and were only offered with the two-door sedan body. This special model, of which 111 to 127 total were made (sources disagree), delivered 657 hp (490 kW) at 7,500 rpm and was known as the Thunderbolt.|$|R
50|$|Like Peugeot's earlier 205 T16, the mid-engine Lancia Delta S4 was a Delta in {{name and}} body styling only (for {{marketing}} purposes), and shared virtually nothing {{in terms of}} construction with the production front-engine Delta. The chassis was a tubular space frame construction much like the 037. It featured long travel double wishbone suspension front and rear, with a single large coil over at the front and separate spring and twin shock absorber at the rear. The bodywork was made of a carbon fibre composite with front and rear bodywork fully detachable for fast replacement due to accident damage, allowing ease of access during on-event servicing. The bodywork featured several aerodynamic aids including bonnet opening behind the front-mounted water radiator with Gurney flap, front splitter and winglets moulded into the front bumper panel, flexible front skirt, and rear deck lid wing that featured both a full aerofoil wind section twinned with a deflection spoiler. The door construction style was brought from the 037 with a hollow shell all-Kevlar construction that had no inner door skin, no door handle or <b>window</b> <b>winder.</b> The door was opened with a small loop and the windows were fixed perspex with small sliding panels to allow some ventilation and passing of time cards and suchlike.|$|R
