40|$|Exposure to fine {{particulate}} matter {{has been associated}} with serious health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Very fine inhalable particles can remain suspended in the atmosphere for a long time, travel long distances from the emitting sources and, once inhaled, they can reach the deepest regions of the lungs and even enter in the circulatory system. Therefore, the smaller the particle size, the higher its toxicity. In typical combustion units used in process industry, the end-of-pipe technologies include trains of consecutive abatements devices. Nevertheless, the traditional particle abatement devices are mainly designed and optimized to treat particles with sizes above or around 1 µm, and they are far less effective towards the submicron dimensions. Among the end-of-pipe technologies, the Wet Scrubbers (WS) are widely utilized in industry due to their capacity to capture simultaneously gaseous pollutants and particles. The main particle collection mechanisms involved in WS are those related to directional interception and inertial impact, which allow high particle abatement efficiency for particles in micrometric range. Both the mechanisms are instead ineffective in the submicron range, thus resulting in low collection efficiencies. It the past 40 years, it was demonstrated that the presence of electric charge of opposite polarities on the particles and the sprayed droplets can increase the capture efficiency due to Coulomb forces between the two phases. The presence of this additional contribution in a scrubber is an upgrade of the traditional wet scrubbing and the new process is commonly referred as <b>Wet</b> <b>Electrostatic</b> Scrubbing (WES). Experimental investigation of the pertinent literature confirmed the ability of WES to increase the particle capture efficiency respect to the classic wet scrubber, but submicron range is generally not directly investigated so that the best operating conditions to increase submicron particle abatement efficiency is still an unsolved problem. This optimization problem is mainly related to the difficulties to model <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> scrubbing process due to the high number of the variables involved, resulting in a complex experimental evaluation of the main collection mechanisms that are responsible of the particle capture. Above all, a significant hindrance to the assessment of a proper description of <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> scrubbing is the complexity of the electro-hydrodynamics of the charged water spray. In this work, a new experimental methodology was adopted to perform experiments in controlled conditions in order to allow an easier investigation {{of the effects of the}} main physical variables on the abatement of submicron particles emission. This experimental approach is based on the use of a lab scale batch reactor, in which charged particles produced by combustion are inserted. In the reactor, a train of uniform droplet size and charge is used to remove the suspended particles. This approach has the main advantages to make possible to investigate specific parameters (like the effect of droplet charge or its size) under well-defined conditions and therefore model the particle abatement process. Therefore, the objective of this work is the experimental analysis and the modeling of <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> scrubbing process for submicron particles with the new methodology developed and the evaluation of the influence of the main physical variables on the capture of submicron particles. The results obtained confirm that the particle abatement is significantly enhanced by charging both particles and droplets, and that the particle abatement rate is directly proportional to the particles and droplet charges and droplet concentration. Furthermore, tests with uncharged particles and charged droplets do not show any relevant increase in the scrubbing efficiency with respect to common wet scrubbing in the investigated conditions. The experimental results obtained were compared with the predictions of classical particle scavenging models valid for ambient temperature and humidity conditions. These models were rarely applied to submicron particles and found a reliable experimental support from the performed experiments. On the other hand, this comparison also confirm the reliability of the experimental methodology in the study of <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> scrubbing and encourage the development of further tests in experimental conditions more similar to that of industrial scrubbers...|$|E

When water droplets precipitate under {{the action of}} gravity and frictional forces, they will collide with smaller aerosol particles and fall to the ground. Usually, either droplets or aerosol particles carry some electric charges, and some may be highly charged. Therefore, the electrostatic effect {{is a very important}} factor in particle scavenging. Wet scrubbers as air pollution control devices use the same theory as scavenging to remove both particulate and gas contaminants from the industrial exhaust streams. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>wet</b> scrubbers were developed in an attempt to improve collection efficiency by raising the attraction force between droplets and particles. Very few numerical models have been developed to describe the phenomenon of particle collection by highly charged droplets when electrostatic force is dominant.

40|$|The {{anthropogenic}} mercury {{emissions from}} various sources have been a global concern because of their potential risks to the human health and environment. Coal-fired power plants are {{the major source of}} worldwide mercury emissions. When mercury emits from coal-fired power plants, it is vaporized into elemental form (Hg 0) in coal combusted flue gas. It undergoes several reactions with other gaseous components (homogeneous) and solid materials (heterogeneous) in coal-fired flue gases. The existing conventional technologies such as <b>wet</b> scrubbers, <b>electrostatic</b> precipitators, and fabric filters could easily control oxidized mercury from coal-fired flue gas. However, the elemental form of mercury is very difficult to control due to its high volatility and insoluble in water. Therefore, the catalytic conversion of elemental form (Hg 0) to its oxidized from (Hg 2 +) is significant, because the oxidized mercury can be easily removed by wet scrubbers due to its high solubility. In this work, various efficient and cost-effective CeO 2 -based materials were developed and evaluated towards elemental mercury oxidation and adsorption under different flue gas conditions at low operating temperatures. During the last decade, ceria-based materials have been intensively studied for several applications such as three way catalysis (TWCs), water gas shift reaction (WGS), sensors, etc., due to the multiple positive effects on the enhancement of catalytic performance. It {{has proved to be a}} material of exceptional technological importance due to its unique properties, including high mechanical strength, oxygen ion conductivity and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) via the redox shift between Ce 4 + and Ce 3 + under oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively. Additionally ceria is also interesting for catalytic conversion economically because it has been shown that adding comparatively inexpensive ceria can allow for substantial reductions in the amount of noble metals needed in various commercial applications. Because of their tremendous properties, it has been also investigating for mercury removal technologies. Therefore, there is still big interest in identification of the catalyst physicochemical properties and plausible mechanisms that lead to improve mercury oxidation performance is obviously important for the development of catalysts for mercury removal in coal-fired power plants. The plausible mechanisms involved in elemental mercury oxidation onto various CeO 2 -based materials have been investigated through packed-bed experiments in a stream of simulated flue gas conditions, including hydrogen chloride (HCl), oxygen (O 2), and ammonia (NH 3). The flue gas components such as HCl and O 2 enhance the Hg 0 oxidation, while NH 3 is found to decrease the Hg 0 oxidation significantly by occupying the active sites on the catalyst surface. In recent years, the CeO 2 -based materials epitomize the most important catalysts for mercury removal and therefore have been investigated for mercury oxidation in this work. Future work will include optimization of catalysts compositions and using other flue gas components such as SO 2, NOx, and humidity (H 2 O) to test the different CeO 2 -based materials for the mercury oxidation performance...|$|R

Despite the fact that a sizeable portion of gas-solid flows are cohesive in nature, the mechanics of cohesive flowing gas-particle systems is still poorly understood, and manipulation/control of the flow variables is still largely done on a trial-and-error basis. Cohesive forces between grains can arise {{from a variety of sources}} [...] such as liquid bridge (capillary) forces, van der Waals forces, orelectrostatic forces [...] and may play a significant role in theprocessing of fine and/or moist powders. While recent advances havebeen made in our understanding of liquid-induced cohesion in quasi-static systems at the macroscopic level [2, 3], in general, it is still not possible to directly connect this macroscopic understanding of cohesion with a microscopic picture of the particle properties and interaction forces. Moreover, conventional theories on gas-solid flows, make no attempt to distinguish between these modes of cohesion, despite clear qualitative differences (lubrication forces in <b>wet</b> systems or <b>electrostatic</b> repulsion are two good examples).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design, construct and commission a new ablative pyrolysis reactor and a high efficiency product collection system. The reactor {{was to have a}} nominal throughput of 10 kg/ 11 r of dry biomass and be inherently scalable up to an industrial scale application of 10 tones/hr. The whole process consists of a bladed ablative pyrolysis reactor, two high efficiency cyclones for char removal and a disk and doughnut quench column combined with a <b>wet</b> walled <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator, which is directly mounted on top, for liquids collection. In order to aid design and scale-up calculations, detailed mathematical modelling was undertaken of the reaction system enabling sizes, efficiencies and operating conditions to be determined. Specifically, a modular approach was taken due to the iterative nature of some of the design methodologies, with the output from one module being the input to the next. Separate modules were developed for the determination of the biomass ablation rate, specification of the reactor capacity, cyclone design, quench column design and electrostatic precipitator design. These models enabled a rigorous design protocol to be developed capable of specifying the required reactor and product collection system size for specified biomass throughputs, operating conditions and collection efficiencies. The reactor proved capable of generating an ablation rate of 0. 63 mm/s for pine wood at a temperature of 525 'DC with a relative velocity between the heated surface and reacting biomass particle of 12. 1 m/s. The reactor achieved a maximum throughput of 2. 3 kg/hr, which was the maximum the biomass feeder could supply. The reactor is capable of being operated at a far higher throughput but this would require a new feeder and drive motor to be purchased. Modelling showed that the reactor is capable of achieving a reactor throughput of approximately 30 kg/hr. This is an area that should be considered for the future as the reactor is currently operating well below its theoretical maximum. Calculations show that the current product collection system could operate efficiently up to a maximum feed rate of 10 kg/Fir, provided the inert gas supply was adjusted accordingly to keep the vapour residence time in the electrostatic precipitator above one second. Operation above 10 kg/hr would require some modifications to the product collection system. Eight experimental runs were documented and considered successful, more were attempted but due to equipment failure had to be abandoned. This does not detract {{from the fact that the}} reactor and product collection system design was extremely efficient. The maximum total liquid yield was 64. 9 % liquid yields on a dry wood fed basis. It is considered that the liquid yield would have been higher had there been sufficient development time to overcome certain operational difficulties and if longer operating runs had been attempted to offset product losses occurring due to the difficulties in collecting all available product from a large scale collection unit. The liquids collection system was highly efficient and modeling determined a liquid collection efficiency of above 99 % on a mass basis. This was validated due to the fact that a dry ice/acetone condenser and a cotton wool filter downstream of the collection unit enabled mass measurements of the amount of condensable product exiting the product collection unit. This showed that the collection efficiency was in excess of 99 % on a mass basis...|$|R
40|$|Question: Forest species {{influence}} soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) storage through litter input and microclimate, which in interaction with soil texture and mineralogy {{may lead to}} differences in SOC stabilization and chemistry. The decline of quacking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and expansion of conifers in the western United States due to natural succession, management practices and climate change could affect SOC dynamics. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (i) assess the effects of overstory composition on SOC storage and stability across the aspen-conifer ecotone, and (ii) characterize the chemical composition of SOC with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Methods: We sampled mineral soil (0 - 15 cm) across the natural gradient of aspen and mixed conifers stands (Abies lasiocarpa and Pseudotsuga menziesii) in semi-arid montane forests from Utah. SOC was divided into light fraction (LF), mineral-associated SOC in the silt and clay fraction (MoM), and a dense subfraction > 53 µm (SMoM) using <b>wet</b> sieving and <b>electrostatic</b> attraction. SOC decomposability and solubility was derived from long term laboratory incubations and hot water extractions. Mineral matrix samples were obtained by removal of organic matter with NaOCl (6 %) at room temperature. We applied Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to analyze the chemistry of organic matter (OM) (i. e., bulk soil spectra – mineral matrix spectra), LF, and MoM. Results: Vegetation cover did not affect SOC storage (47. 0 ± 16. 5 Mg C ha− 1), SOC decomposability (cumulative CO 2 -C release of 93. 2 ± 65. 4 g C g− 1 C), or SOC solubility (9. 8 ± 7. 2 mg C g− 1 C), but MoM content increased with presence of aspen [pure aspen (31. 2 ± 15. 1 Mg C ha- 1) > mixed (25. 7 ± 8. 8 Mg C ha− 1) > conifer (22. 8 ± 9. 0 Mg C ha− 1) ]. Silt+clay (%) had a positive effect on MoM content (r = 0. 64, p 70 %). Management efforts towards the conservation and regeneration of aspen may promote long-term C sequestration in sites with silt + clay content around 40 - 70 %. Greater storage of MoM under aspen may be caused by chemical protection of relatively simple molecules resulting from litter breakdown, fine root turnover, or rhizodeposition, rather than the preservation of recalcitrant compounds (i. e., aliphatic C) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{promising}} {{technology has}} been developed to capture and remove elemental mercury species from coal-fired power plants. Powerspan Corp. has licensed the technology and initiated a bench and pilot test program to develop the Photochemical Oxidation, or PCO™, process for commercial application with subbituminous and lignite fuels. The process {{has the potential to}} serve as a low cost mercury oxidation technology that will facilitate elemental mercury removal in a downstream SO 2 scrubber, <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator (WESP), or baghouse. It uses 254 -nanometer (nm) ultraviolet light from a mercury lamp to produce an excited state mercury species in the flue gas, leading to oxidation of elemental mercury. This paper presents results of Powerspan’s initial bench-scale testing on a simulated flue gas stream. Preliminary testing conducted in Powerspan’s bench-scale facility showed greater than 90 % oxidation and removal of elemental mercury. The process also has potential to serve as a low cost method for the removal of mercury from waste incinerator flue gases...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} obtained with {{a prototype of}} <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> scrubber suitably designed to remove fine and ultrafine particles from exhaust gases. Experiments were carried out on amodel combustion gas containing particles with diameters from 10 to 450 nm, which can be negatively charged in a specially designed corona charging unit. A full-cone spray nozzle with induction electrode was used to generate positively-charged water droplets (5 % of the Rayleigh limit) with a mean diameter of about 290 μm. The particles removal efficiency was determined for different magnitudes of electric charges on particles and droplets and for two values of liquid-to-gas ratio, equal to 0. 88 and 1. 15. The experiments revealed that when both particles and droplets were left uncharged, the removal efficiency was very small. When only droplets were charged, the efficiency was of about 35 % in number. The highest efficiency, overcoming 91 %, was achieved when both particles and droplets were oppositely charged. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Multi-pollutant control {{technologies}} {{will become more}} important in the future. This new membrane <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator (WESP) system is ideally suited to, and very cost effective for, removing PM 2. 5, SO 3 and Hg+ 2 after limestone wet flue gas desulphurization (WFGD) scrubbers in the utility industry. Several coal-fired utilities have been experiencing increased SO 3 emissions from their existing WFGD scrubbers, especially after installing a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx Control. Achieving co-benefits of Hg removal by installing SCR's and WFGD systems is already becoming a key strategy for reducing mercury levels after coal fired power plants. WESP can readily collect acid aerosol and fine particulate due to greater corona power and virtually no re-entrainment. The WESP can also enhance collection of Hg (Hg ash & Hg+ 2). The main historical limitation associated with wet precipitators has been the higher cost of special alloys and stainless steel material used in their manufacture. This new technology WESP, based on fabric membrane for the collecting electrodes, dramatically reduces weight and cost, compared to conventional, metallic WESPs...|$|E

However, conventional ESP has not been used to remove gaseous pollutants from a gas flow. Recently, a wet-type ESP {{has been used for}} removing them. In this study, to improve the removal performance of gaseous pollutants and particulate matters, a wet-type ESP with a <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> flocking electrode was experimentally studied by measuring the removal efficiency of acetaldehyde and fine particles. And a carbon fabric plate as a collecting electrode was suggested to effectively remove ozone and fine particles in ESPs. Removal efficiency of acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO: about 30 ppm) in one-pass test was about 68. 2 % at 8. 4 W of input power with residence time of 2. 1 s and high collection efficiency was obtained to submicron particles (0. 3 - 0. 5 Pm in diameter) with residence time of 1. 05 s. The combined system of the wet type ESP and ESP with a carbon fabric plate electrode also was examined for removing them. These results suggest that the wet-type ESP has a potential of the simultaneous removal of gaseous and particulate pollutants. 1...|$|E
40|$|Gaseous SO 3 (H 2 SO 4) {{condenses}} into {{a nucleus}} and becomes sulfuric acid mist in a cooling process {{such as the}} wet flue gas desulfurization system (WFGD). The relation between the temperature condition of this cooling process and particle size of mist was examined by condensation theory and experiment s. In addition, the collecting efficiency and electric current density of a <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator (WESP) were examined with the mist generated by the cooling process. Particle sizes of mist were measured at 30 ppm of SO 3 under various cooling conditions, and were measured in the case where fine particles of ammonium sulfate were supplied by spray-drying. The particle size of the nucleus into which mist condenses depended on {{the speed at which}} the gas is cooled. At a slower cooling speed, mist did not condense into small particles. This indicates that the particle size of mist grows in the range where the gas temperature around the SO 3 condensation temperature is lowered slowly. The electric current density of THE model ESP increased when the particle size of mist was larger, and the collecting efficiency was improved, too. This indicates that the specific collecting area of the ESP is influenced by the cooling condition...|$|E
