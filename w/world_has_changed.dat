[...] As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences [...] "seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that." [...] Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, [...] "The dynamic in the <b>world</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E

[...] Following the resolution of the mission in [...] "", he wanted the crew to receive [...] "a great reception" [...] on their return to Earth.

[...] was one that they wanted to answer in the fourth season. Tancharoen called the Inhumans [...] "a permanent part of our universe now", with Whedon adding, [...] "we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explore the metaphors of {{what it is like to}} be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] With the Inhumans film being removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans, though the series would focus less on Inhumans than the third season which saw [...] "a real significant Inhuman agenda story".

500|$|In 2005 David Crane {{published}} a new Scott biography {{in which he}} comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates [...] "so wholly obscured by legend". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott [...] "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the <b>world</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> since the [...] "hopeless heroism and obscene waste" [...] of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that once made Britain great were not extinct, but with the knowledge what lay only two years ahead, the ideals of duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring. Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, [...] "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data." [...] Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that [...] "in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years". The New York Times Book Review was more critical, pointing out Crane's support for Scott's account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery from the pack ice, and concluded that [...] "For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise." ...|$|E
