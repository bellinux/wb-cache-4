2500|$|Jonathan Tobin {{wrote in}} The Jewish World Review that [...] "Rosenfeld {{is careful to}} specify that {{questioning}} policies of Israeli governments {{is not the same}} as being anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. But he has the bad manners to point out that those who aggressively question Israel's right to have any government or to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it are, at best, unwitting allies of a growing anti-Jewish movement.... For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to know where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>headed,</b> we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it has gotten to the point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E

5000|$|Netflix {{picking up}} the series is a hopeful sign for {{independent}} filmmakers and another step into offering a variety of diverse content to audiences, according to Varghese. [...] "This is still an independent production and that's what I'm most proud of… this really opens the doors {{for a lot of}} independent filmmakers," [...] he said. [...] "I think the fact that Netflix and other platforms are open to such content is a big sign that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>headed</b> in the right direction and in terms of diversity, and also as an independent filmmaker, I think it's good on both sides." [...] Varghese noted that series like The Mindy Project and Master of None have tremendously paved the way for South Asian representation, but while there is progress, there are more stories to tell. [...] "Our show is a little bit quirkier, I don't think it's as drama driven as the other two shows, but I think there's a lot more stories that we're able to explore." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{last issue}} of Gidra was {{published}} in April of 1974, five years after its first publication. Among the issues eighty pages was an article titled “Toward Barefoot Journalism” by Mike Murase that expressed uncertainty about Gidra’s future and gave reasons for the paper’s dissolution. Murase wrote, “There is a shared feeling, a premonition if you will, that now is somehow {{a good time to}} sum up our experiences. We want to go on, continue publishing, but we need now to see how far we have come, so that we may be clear about where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>headed</b> and how we will get there.” Murase also cited problems with staffing and editorial organization, personal and publication-related financial struggles, and the feeling among staff that the process of assembling the paper “had become mechanical, individualized, and alienating." [...] In his last article, Murase wrote,As we continue to struggle, what needs resembling now is the richness and vitality of this total experience called Gidra, which {{is much more than a}} newspaper. It has been an experience in sharing—in giving and receiving—in a sisterly and brotherly atmosphere. It has meant a chance to actively work for something we really believe in. It has meant a chance to express ourselves in a variety of ways. It has been a lesson in humility and perseverance. It has meant working with people who care about people, and genuinely feeling the strength that can only come out of collective experiences. But, what a struggle!The staff of Gidra left open the possibility of continuing Gidra in the future or possibly creating a new publication more suited to the Movement. Staffers continued meeting after Gidra’s final issue, and most stayed actively involved in the field.|$|E
