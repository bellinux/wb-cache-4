The Raw after Backlash, Eric Bischoff ordered a No Disqualification match between him and Stratus. If Stratus won, she <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> championship rematch the next week; if Bischoff won, he would get to spend a night with her. Bischoff {{would go on to}} win the match, though the stipulation was nulified when Linda McMahon confronted him after the match.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} from Congress party membership. He did not {{disagree with the}} party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E

On May 1, 2012, it was confirmed by Jon Chu that G.I. Joe: Retaliations Cobra Commander is Rex Lewis, the same character that Joseph Gordon-Levitt played in The Rise of Cobra.

5|$|The storyline {{surrounding}} the WWF World Heavyweight Championship {{began at the}} 1994 Royal Rumble when the final two wrestlers, Lex Luger and Bret Hart, simultaneously eliminated each other. After a disagreement between two referees, Jack Tunney, the WWF President, declared Luger and Hart co-winners. Tunney announced that both wrestlers <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania, the prize given to {{the winner of the}} Royal Rumble match, and both wrestlers would have to wrestle two matches for the pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|Areola <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{chance in}} Ligue 1, however, as Claude Makélélé's Bastia {{stepped in to}} sign him on loan for the 2014–15 Ligue 1 campaign, with the deal being {{completed}} on 26 July 2014. Signed as the replacement for the retired Mickaël Landreau, he made his debut for the club on 9 August in a 3–3 draw with Marseille. Areola ultimately made 39 appearances across all competitions for the club, keeping 13 clean sheets as Bastia ended the Ligue 1 season in 12th place and as runners-up in the Coupe de la Ligue. The Final, which took place on 11 April, was contested between Bastia and Areola's parent club PSG, with the match ending 4–0 in favour of the Parisians.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 2005, Judah <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> rematch with Spinks at the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Spinks' hometown. The {{fight was}} the first major bout in St. Louis in more than 40years, and it was a sellout. Judah was the aggressor {{throughout}} the fight. He knocked Spinks down to his knees at the bell in the seventh round, but it was not ruled a knockdown. Spinks had a strong start to the ninth round and connected with a left hand, then followed with a right hand and a combination, but Judah scored a knockdown moments later. Judah pressed the attack after the first knockdown and avoided Spinks' desperate efforts to tie him up. After Spinks was knocked down for the second time, the referee stopped the fight, and Judah became the new Undisputed Welterweight Champion.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> landscaping so that it looked like a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E

A patch was released in January 2016, fixing bugs and altering the appearance of blue attacks to help colorblind players see them better. Sony Interactive Entertainment announced during E3 2017 that Undertale <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> release for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, a Japanese localization, and a retail version published by Fangamer.

5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on 20 May. However, England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson wanted a four-week break {{before the start of}} the 2006 FIFA World Cup, so that if any England players were involved (Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Peter Crouch all later made his squad) <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> decent rest before the tournament. The final was scheduled to be held at Wembley Stadium, however the stadium had fallen behind in its rebuild and would not be completed in time for the final. The final would instead be played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, where it had been held since 2001. Mike Dean was originally appointed to referee the final, but questions about his impartiality were raised as he resided close to Liverpool. He was replaced by Alan Wiley.|$|E
5|$|After Final Resolution with Kurt Angle {{retaining}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, TNA had {{to determine who}} he would face at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. On the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!, Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, and A.J. Styles fought in a Three Way match {{to determine the number}} one contender. Stipulations for the match were that the winner <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, setting up Angle versus Cage at Against All Odds. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Angle defeated Cage at Against All Odds after interference from Tomko.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the First World War, Rhodesia's white {{population}} was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of South Africa, and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with South Africa would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving the burden on South Africa instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with South Africa. For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that it <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better price for its assets from South Africa than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since South Africa would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also {{on the side of the}} Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union.|$|E

5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, hoping that he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E

Later that night, she teamed with Winter in a losing effort to Kanellis and Rosita. On March 17, 2013, Hall returned to TNA {{to take part in}} the tapings of the TNA Knockout Knockdown One Night Only pay-per-view, where she was defeated by Velvet Sky.

5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E

5|$|The cup {{stayed in}} the convent until 1882 when the nuns were short of funds and wanted to sell it. It was {{at some point during}} this period that the pearl border to the cover and the Tudor finial were removed. The nuns decided they <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was {{entrusted}} to Simon Campo, a priest, who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron Jérôme Pichon, researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current Duke of Frías, who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, on looking further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Destination X was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting The Unlikely Alliance of Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J.

The storyline behind this match was Joe's quest {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Angle, with the two {{scheduled}} {{to fight for the}} title at TNA's next PPV event Lockdown on April 13, 2008. Also connected was Cage's feud with Styles and Tomko, after the two betrayed him and cost him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice against Angle in the storyline at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008, and at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. This bout was announced on the February 21, 2008, episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact! during a backstage segment between Joe and Management Director Jim Cornette. On the March 6, 2008, episode of Impact!, the participants in the match fought in a series of matches to determine who <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> five-minute man advantaged at Destination X.
