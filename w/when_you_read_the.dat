500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun {{and the love of}} music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept where some of the lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an audio sample from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record so we could go on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring.|$|E
2500|$|On February 8, {{during his}} Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West {{explained}} how the collaboration came to fruition: [...] "I'm {{executive producer of}} Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... So now we at the Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like she has this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, a bohemian {{scientist}} and eccentric detective-for-hire {{who becomes a}} wanted fugitive in his hunt for Lord Blackwood while constantly being followed {{by the presence of}} Professor Moriarty. Downey was visiting Joel Silver's offices with his wife, producer Susan Downey, when he learned about the project. Ritchie initially felt Downey was too old for the role because he wanted the film to show a younger Holmes on a learning curve like Batman Begins. Ritchie decided {{to take a chance on}} casting him in the role, and Downey told the BBC that [...] "I think me and Guy are well-suited to working together. The more I look into the books, the more fantastic it becomes. Holmes is such a weirdo". Downey also revealed what his wife had to say: [...] "that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> description of the guy — quirky and kind of nuts— it could be a description of me". Downey intended to focus more on Holmes' patriotic side and his bohemianism, and felt that his work on Chaplin had prepared him for an English accent. Ritchie feels his accent is [...] "flawless". Both Downey and Ritchie are martial arts enthusiasts, and have been inspired by the Baritsu mentioned in the 1901 story [...] "The Adventure of the Empty House". Downey lost weight for the part, because during a chat he had with Chris Martin, Martin recommended that Holmes look [...] "gaunt" [...] and [...] "skinny".|$|E

I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ But I think he does. He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?" [...] Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; [...] "I guess kind of the thing which I found interesting {{is that he is}} essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [...] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him {{but at the same time}} can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is." [...] Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: [...] "bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor." [...] Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels.|$|E

Also, I think that this foul disease is that which Solomon intends when he saith, speaking of this unclean and beastly creature, 'A wound and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away' (Prov 6:33). A punishment Job calls it; a wound and dishonour Solomon calls it; and they both do set it as a remark upon this sin; Job calling it a 'strange punishment,' and Solomon a 'reproach that shall not be wiped away,' from them that are common in it.|$|E
60|$|Poor Mr. O'Mahony had enemies {{on every}} side. There {{had come up}} lately a state of things which must be very common in {{political}} life. The hatreds which sound so real <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> mere words, which look so true when you see their scornful attitudes, on which for the time you are inclined to pin your faith so implicitly, amount to nothing. The Right Honourable A. has {{to do business with}} the Honourable B., and can best carry it on by loud expressions and strong arguments such as will be palatable to readers of newspapers; but they do not hate each other as the readers of the papers hate them, and are ready enough to come to terms, if coming to terms is required. Each of them respects the other, though each of them is very careful to hide his respect. We can fancy that the Right Honourable A. and the Honourable B. in their moments of confidential intercourse laugh in their joint sleeves at the antipathies of the public. In the present instance it was alleged that the Right Honourable A. and the Honourable B. had come to some truce together, and had ceased for a while to hit each other hard knocks. Such a truce {{was supposed to be a}} feather in the cap of the Honourable B., as he was leader of a poor party of no more than twenty; and the Right Honourable A. had in this matter the whole House at his back. But for the nonce each had come off his high horse, and for the moment there was peace between them.|$|E
60|$|To {{turn to a}} more {{pleasing}} subject. Have you painted {{anything else}} beside this picture from 'Peter Bell'? Your two oil-paintings (and, indeed, everything I have of yours) have been much admired by the artists who have seen them. And, for our own parts, we like them better every day; this, in particular, {{is the case with}} the small picture from the neighbourhood of Coleorton, which, indeed, pleased me much at the first sight, but less impressed the rest of our household, who now see as many beauties in it as I do myself. Havill, the water-colour painter, was much pleased with these things; he is painting at Ambleside, and has done a view of Rydal Water, looking down upon it from Rydal Park, of which I should like to know your opinion; it will be exhibited in the Spring, in the water-colour Exhibition. I have purchased a black-lead pencil sketch of Mr. Green, of Ambleside, which, I think, has great merit, the materials being uncommonly picturesque, and well put together: I should dearly like to have the same subject (it is the cottage at Glencoign, by Ulleswater) treated by you. In the poem I have just written, you will find one situation which, if the work should ever become familiarly known, would furnish as fine a subject for a picture as any thing I remember in poetry ancient or modern. I need not mention what it is, as <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> poem you cannot miss it. We have at last had, by the same post, two letters from Coleridge, long and melancholy; and also, from Keswick, an account so depressing as to the state of his health, that I should have set off immediately to London, to see him, if I had not myself been confined by indisposition.|$|E
