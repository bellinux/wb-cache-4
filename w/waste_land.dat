5|$|Each poem {{has five}} {{sections}}. The later poems {{connect to the}} earlier sections, with Little Gidding synthesising the themes of the earlier poems within its sections. Within Eliot's own poetry, the five sections connect to The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land.</b> This allowed Eliot to structure his larger poems, which he had difficulty with.|$|E
5|$|The poet T. S. Eliot, {{inspired}} by his reading of the Upanishads, based the final portion of his famous poem The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> (1922) upon one of its verses. According to Eknath Easwaran, the Upanishads are snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness.|$|E

Two years later he went to New York where he attended the opening of an exhibition featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land.</b> He went on to Hamilton College where he received a standing ovation.|$|E
5|$|Burnt Norton is {{the first}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. He created it while working on his play Murder in the Cathedral and it was first {{published}} in his Collected Poems 1909–1935 (1936). The poem's title refers to a Cotswolds manor house Eliot visited. The manor's garden served as an important image within the poem. Structurally, the poem is based on Eliot's The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> with passages of the poem related to those excised from Murder in the Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme has been seen {{as one of the most}} popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> (1922). The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions that specify land grants, {{rights and}} {{ownership}} were descriptive of {{the boundaries of}} demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included {{was the type of}} soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and <b>waste</b> <b>land.</b> There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.|$|E
5|$|With the {{appearance}} of both Ulysses and T. S. Eliot's poem, The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land,</b> 1922 was a key year {{in the history of}} English-language literary modernism. In Ulysses, Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom's Directory—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.|$|E

It is the first film to win Audience Awards at both the Sundance and Berlin festivals. At the International Documentary Association Awards, presenter Morgan Spurlock memorably handed Walker the Best Documentary Feature Award wrapped inside a garbage bag. The joke referenced the black garbage bag that Walker had worn to the New York theatrical premiere of <b>Waste</b> <b>Land.</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> was released theatrically in the USA by Arthouse Films, in Canada, in the UK by E1 Entertainment, and in Australia/NZ by Hopscotch Films.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> {{is notable}} for its {{seemingly}} disjointed structure, {{indicative of the}} Modernist style of James Joyce's Ulysses (which Eliot cited as an influence and which he read {{the same year that}} he was writing The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land).</b> In the Modernist style, Eliot jumps from one voice or image to another without clearly delineating these shifts for the reader. He also includes phrases from multiple foreign languages (Latin, Greek, Italian, German, French and Sanskrit), indicative of Pound's influence.|$|E

25|$|Eliot's {{influence}} {{extends beyond}} the English language.

Eliot additionally influenced, among many others, Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, William Gaddis, Allen Tate, Ted Hughes, Geoffrey Hill, Seamus Heaney, Kamau Brathwaite, Russell Kirk, George Seferis (who in 1936 published a modern Greek translation of The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land,)</b> and James Joyce.|$|E

25|$|The poet Ezra Pound (1885–1972) {{was born}} in Idaho but {{spent much of his}} adult life in Europe. His work is complex, {{sometimes}} obscure, with multiple references to other art forms and to a vast range of literature, both Western and Eastern. He influenced many other poets, notably T. S. Eliot (1888–1965), another expatriate. Eliot wrote spare, cerebral poetry, carried by a dense structure of symbols. In The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land,</b> he embodied a jaundiced vision of post–World War I society in fragmented, haunted images. Like Pound's, Eliot's poetry could be highly allusive, and some editions of The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> come with footnotes supplied by the poet. In 1948, Eliot won the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{question}} as to whether Eliot originally intended The <b>Waste</b> <b>Land</b> to be a collection of individual poems (additional poems were supplied to Pound for his comments on including them) or to be considered one poem with five sections.|$|E
