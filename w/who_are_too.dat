5|$|In 2003 the BBC {{announced}} {{the return of}} Doctor Who, {{as a series of}} webcasts to air on bbc.com. Richard E. Grant was announced as the Ninth Doctor. A webcast, written by Paul Cornell, entitled Scream of the Shalka was completed, and aired on bbc.com. This was followed by an online short story entitled The Feast of the Stone. Work was already well underway on the third webcast, entitled Blood of the Robots. This was to be written by Simon Clark. However, before production began, it was announced that Doctor Who would be returning to television, with Russell T. Davies as Producer. Blood of the Robots was never made. Blood of the Robots synopsis:- A blend of adventure, drama and humour. The Doctor arrives to find a world full of intelligent, sensitive robots that have been abandoned by their human owners, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> squeamish to 'kill' them when they're obsolete. Now ruthless salvage squads are hunting the robots in order to make room for human settlers forced to migrate from their dangerously over-crowded home planet.|$|E

25|$|Self-fabric feet : Sleepers made {{in sizes}} for infants <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> young to walk often omit the {{slip-resistant}} soles on the feet, instead having soles {{made from the}} same fabric {{as the rest of}} the sleeper.

25|$|For example, {{the family}} units of several East African ethnic {{communities}} live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different {{members of the}} family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> old to share space with {{the women of the}} family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E

25|$|Sterilization {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Brazil since it became legal and free for women over 25 in 1996, and is regulated by the Health Ministry. It had already been a popular practice among poor communities before the legalization of sterilization, and was practiced in private clinics. In 1994, over sixty percent of women in Goiás, and over seventy percent of women in Maranhão and Mato Grosso were sterilized. After the 1996 law, sterilization {{became part of the}} population control policy of the Brazilian government. Though some view sterilization as an inexpensive form of birth control and a useful tool in population control, others see the mass use of sterilization in Brazil as contrary to promoting women's choices in contraceptive use. Sterilization is most common among Afro-Brazilians in the Northeast of the country <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> poor to afford other types of contraception and uneducated on the long term consequences of sterilization. Scholars such as Andre Caetano and Joseph E. Potter claim that sterilization {{has been used as a}} political means of garnering votes while controlling population growth among poor, minority populations.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 11 January 1995, {{the first}} episode looks at how plants are able to move. The bramble is an {{aggressive}} example: it advances forcefully {{from side to side}} and, once settled on its course, there is little that can stand in its way. An altogether faster species is the birdcage plant, which inhabits Californian sand dunes. When its location becomes exposed, it shifts at great speed to another one with the assistance of wind — and it is this that allows many forms of vegetation to distribute their seeds. While not a plant, the spores of fungi are also spread in a similar fashion. One of the most successful (and intricate) flowers to use the wind is the dandelion, whose seeds travel with the aid of 'parachutes'. They are needed to travel miles away from their parents, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> densely packed to allow any new arrivals. Trees have the advantage of height to send their seeds further, and the cottonwood is shown as a specialist in this regard. The humidity of the tropical rainforest creates transportation problems, and the liana-species Alsomitra macrocarpa is one plant whose seeds are aerodynamic 'gliders'. Some, such as those of the sycamore, take the form of 'helicopters', while others, such as the squirting cucumber release their seeds by 'exploding'. Water is also a widely used method of propulsion. The tropical sea bean Entada gigas has one of the biggest fruits of all plants and is dispersed by water streams. However, most plants use living couriers, whether they be dogs, humans and other primates, ants or birds, etc., and to that end, they use colour and smell to signify when they are ripe for picking.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked why}} the {{mechanism}} of unlocking maps and characters - accomplished in previous titles by purchasing them with points or coins won through battle - was removed, the developers apologized, commenting that after long deliberation, they felt that such a mechanic was detrimental to the enjoyment of gamers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> busy {{to take the time}} to unlock all of these things. As a result, they designed this game in a way that allowed players to play any non-story based map they wanted, introducing other mechanics to encourage players to keep playing. The developers commented that Days of Ruin had more strategy than previous entries in the series due to the changes and removals made to the game compared to the other titles.|$|E

500|$|Outside {{mainland}} China, {{a network}} of volunteer [...] "contact persons," [...] regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exists in approximately 70 countries. In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read (or re-read) Li Hongzhi's writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours. Group study sessions typically {{take place in the}} evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as [...] "the closest thing to a regular 'congregational experience'" [...] that Falun Gong offers. Individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately.|$|E
500|$|This episode starts by {{depicting}} the game show Wheel of Fortune. When Brian is watching Malcolm in the Middle on television, a scene begins showing {{the mother of}} the fictional family screaming at the children and father. Jane Kaczmarek was asked to do the voice as she was the original actor in the series; however, she refused. MacFarlane said that he gets a message that Kaczmarek wishes to portray that character as likable, and does not wish to jeopardize that. The father during that scene was voiced by Bryan Cranston, the original actor in the series, who accepted the role. Seth MacFarlane comments that [...] "this is the first real Quagmire story we've ever done." [...] A scene was made of Stewie attending a meeting similar to those at Alcoholics Anonymous; however, the meeting was designed for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> addicted to breast milk. The format of Wheel of Fortune is somewhat similar to the layout of the modern-day program, but the scene also features several aspects which are now no longer broadcast, such as not automatically being given R, S, T, L, N, and E, and were featured in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. {{frequently}} {{uses its}} economic power {{in order to}} punish other countries. [...] One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food. [...] Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they {{can be broken down}} into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives. [...] The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S. [...] An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government. [...] More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> weak to be anti-communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements. [...] An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically. [...] The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.|$|E

2500|$|Aristotle {{proposed}} that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences {{and so the}} [...] "imprint" [...] can easily continue.

Likewise, people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have perception of time.|$|E
