50|$|For IPv4 packets, Path MTU Discovery {{works by}} setting the Don't Fragment (DF) flag {{bit in the}} IP headers of {{outgoing}} packets. Then, any device along the path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop it, and send back an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Fragmentation Needed (Type 3, Code 4) message containing its MTU, allowing the source host to reduce its Path MTU appropriately. The process is repeated until the MTU is small enough to traverse the entire path <b>without</b> <b>fragmentation.</b>|$|E

For IPv6, Path MTU Discovery works by initially assuming the path MTU {{is the same as}} the MTU on the link layer interface where the traffic originates.

The bimodal brightness distribution of 'new' comets indicates that their formation mechanism is straightforward accretion <b>without</b> later <b>fragmentation.</b> Data on retrograde versus prograde orbits and their relevance to the rotation of the Oort cloud are examined.

The decomposition pathway is shown to involve the activated dissociation of this chemisorbed precursor to produce Al, adsorbed H atoms and trimethylamine. The latter species desorb <b>without</b> further <b>fragmentation</b> and this key feature results in the deposition of carbon-free aluminium films.

50|$|The MTUs in {{this section}} are given as the maximum size of an IP packet that can be {{transmitted}} <b>without</b> <b>fragmentation</b> over a given medium - including IP headers but excluding headers from lower levels in the protocol stack. The MTU must {{not be confused with}} the minimum datagram size that all hosts must be prepared to accept, which has a value of 576 bytes for IPv4 and of 1280 bytes for IPv6. It must also not be confused with the maximum size for the physically transmitted frame. In the case of an Ethernet frame this adds an overhead of 18 bytes, or 22 bytes with an IEEE 802.1Q tag for VLAN or quality of service.|$|E
5000|$|... 6in4 is an Internet {{transition}} {{mechanism for}} migrating from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to IPv6. 6in4 uses tunneling to encapsulate IPv6 traffic over explicitly-configured IPv4 links {{as defined in}} RFC 4213 (obsoletes RFC 2893 and RFC 1933). The 6in4 traffic is sent over the IPv4 Internet inside IPv4 packets whose IP headers have the IP protocol number set to 41. This protocol number is specifically designated for IPv6 encapsulation. In 6in4, the IPv4 packet header is immediately followed by the IPv6 packet being carried. This means that the encapsulation overhead is simply {{the size of the}} IPv4 header of 20 bytes. With an Ethernet Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 1500 bytes, one can thus send IPv6 packets of 1480 bytes <b>without</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> 6in4 tunneling is also referred to as proto-41 static because the endpoints are configured statically. Although 6in4 tunnels are generally manually configured, for example the utility AICCU can configure tunnel parameters automatically after retrieving information from a Tunnel Information and Control Protocol (TIC) server.|$|E

40|$|Several {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} suggest that silicate grains in primitive meteorites are not interstellar grains but condensates formed in the early solar system. Moreover, the size distribution of matrix grains in chondrites implies that these condensates might be formed as nanometer-sized grains. Therefore, we propose a novel scenario for rocky planetesimal formation in which nanometer-sized silicate grains are produced by evaporation and recondensation events in early solar nebula, and rocky planetesimals are formed via aggregation of these nanograins. We reveal that silicate nanograins can grow into rocky planetesimals via direct aggregation <b>without</b> catastrophic <b>fragmentation</b> and serious radial drift, and our results provide a suitable condition for protoplanet formation in our solar system.

The water-soluble compound can rapidly liberate a water-insoluble fluorescent precipitate by intramolecular attack {{of a free}} amine on a phenolic ester group via a six-membered transition state. One of the crucial steps in the synthesis of this molecule was a sterically very unfavored nucleophilic substitution to create a tertiary ether; this was optimized using model compounds. Another key challenge was deprotection by catalytic hydrogenation at low temperatures in order to furnish the hydroacetate of the free amine <b>without</b> further <b>fragmentation.</b> LC-MS and fluorescence studies showed that this compound collapsed instantaneously in methanol, as well as within a wide pH range in buffered aqueous media...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} {{structure of the}} cell wall galactomannan of Candida lipolytica was analyzed using two-dimensional NMR techniques <b>without</b> chemical <b>fragmentation.</b> The H- 1 -H- 2 -correlated cross-peaks of the galactomannan indicated that it consists of an α- 1, 6 -linked mannan backbone moiety with side chains. A sequential NMR assignment of the side chains through nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) cross-peaks indicated that the triose side chain contains an α- 1, 2 -linked galactopyranose unit at the non-reducing terminal. The structure was {{significantly different from the}} galactomannan of Trichophyton. The molar ratio of the side chains calculated from the H- 1 signal dimensions indicated that ca. 45 % of the backbone α- 1, 6 -linked mannose units are not substituted with side chains and are responsible for the reactivity of the galactomannan with factor 9 serum...|$|R

To compare those lesions seen in 'old' dogs with those seen in 'young' dogs between the ages of five and 18 months. Methods: A retrospective study of dogs six-years-old and older admitted for elbow lameness and subsequent elbow arthroscopy. The dogs were divided into groups according to the lesions of the medial coronoid process diagnosed during arthroscopic examination and computed tomography (Q. The radiographic degree of osteoarthritis (OA) and arthroscopically diagnosed lesions on the medial humeral condyle are described. Results: In 51 'old' dogs, five types of lesions could be identified on arthroscopy and CT: chondromalacia-like lesions (2 %), fissures (27. 5 %), non-displaced fragments (12 %), displaced fragments (27. 5 %), and erosions within the medial compartment <b>without</b> <b>fragmentation</b> (31 %). A significantly different distribution of lesions was seen in 'young' dogs: fissures (23 %), non-displaced fragments (45 %), displaced fragments (29 %), and erosions within the medial compartment <b>without</b> <b>fragmentation</b> (3 %).

40|$|AbstractInsights {{into the}} direct {{monitoring}} of supported peptide synthesis were realized through {{the design of}} time of flight static secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-S-SIMS) experiments. The mass spectrometric method was carried out at the resin bead level and was found reproducible (intra- and inter-day assays), sensitive (femtomol level) and non-destructive (only 0. 01 % of the peptides were destroyed by the primary ion beam bombardment). The nature of the peptide–resin linkage governed the recovery of ions characterizing the whole peptide sequence. A S-SIMS cleavable bond was thus required solely in that position to achieve {{the release of the}} growing structures from the insoluble support into the gas phase <b>without</b> any <b>fragmentation.</b> Results are presented with standard solid-phase resins allowing linkage through an amide or an ester bond.

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Results Differences in fragmentation rates {{between the two}} pulse duration regimes were detected with statistical significance for defined settings. Hand-held and motivated Ho:YAG laser-assisted fragmentation of BEGO stones showed {{no significant difference between}} short pulse mode and long pulse mode, neither in fragmentation rates nor in number of fragments and fragment sizes. Similarly, the results of the hands-free fragmentation tests (with and without anti-repulsion device) showed no statistical differ-ences between long pulse and short pulse modes. Conclusion The study showed that fragmentation rates for long and short pulse durations at identical power set-tings remain at a comparable level.
