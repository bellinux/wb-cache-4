5|$|The Lulworth skipper (Thymelicus acteon) is a {{butterfly}} of the Hesperiidae family.

5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms {{section of}} the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid {{sturgeon}} larvae <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently {{being used by the}} larva pallid sturgeon for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.|$|E

5|$|Lavanify is a {{mammalian}} genus {{from the}} late Cretaceous (probably Maastrichtian, about 71 to 66 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species, L.miolaka, is known from two isolated teeth, {{one of which is}} damaged. The teeth <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> 1995–1996 and described in 1997. The animal is classified as a member of Gondwanatheria, an enigmatic extinct group with unclear phylogenetic relationships, and within Gondwanatheria {{as a member of the}} family Sudamericidae. Lavanify is most closely related to the Indian Bharattherium; the South American Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium are more distantly related. Gondwanatheres probably ate hard plant material.|$|E

5|$|The type {{remains of}} Hypacrosaurus remains <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> 1910 by Barnum Brown for the American Museum of Natural History. The remains, a partial postcranial {{skeleton}} consisting of several vertebrae and a partial pelvis (AMNH 5204), came from along the Red Deer River near Tolman Ferry, Alberta, Canada, from rocks {{of what is}} now known as the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (early Maastrichtian, Upper Cretaceous). Brown described these remains, in combination with other postcranial bones, in 1913 as a new genus that he considered to be like Saurolophus. No skull was known at this time, but two skulls were soon discovered and described.|$|E
5|$|Two dozen wooden objects bearing rongorongo inscriptions, some heavily weathered, burned, or {{otherwise}} damaged, <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th century {{and are now}} scattered in museums and private collections. None remain on Easter Island. The objects are mostly tablets shaped from irregular pieces of wood, sometimes driftwood, but include a chieftain's staff, a bird-man statuette, and two reimiro ornaments. There are also a few petroglyphs which may include short rongorongo inscriptions. Oral history suggests {{that only a small}} elite was ever literate and that the tablets were sacred.|$|E
5|$|Early {{discoveries of}} indricotheres were made through various colonial links to Asia. The first known indricothere fossils were {{collected}} from Balochistan (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time. The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were discovered by the British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907–1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, {{and the back of}} a jaw. The fossils <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium; A. bugtiense. Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon; it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros, many of which have since been moved to other genera. Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species.|$|E

5|$|Hipposideros besaoka is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Hipposideros. It is known from {{numerous}} jaws and teeth, which <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> a cave at Anjohibe in 1996 and {{described as a}} new species in 2007. The site where H.besaoka was found is at most 10,000 years old; {{other parts of the}} cave have yielded H. commersoni, a living species of Hipposideros from Madagascar, and some material that is distinct from both species. H.besaoka was larger than H.commersoni, making it the largest insectivorous bat of Madagascar, and had broader molars and a more robust lower jaw. As usual in Hipposideros, the second upper premolar is small and displaced from the toothrow, and the second lower premolar is large.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon his}} arrival in Germany, Accum went {{to the town of}} Althaldensleben. There, the {{industrialist}} Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets, and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum. He remained only a short time in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His teaching in the areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> the two volume work, Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckmässige Anwendung, published in Berlin in 1826.

5|$|In {{collaboration}} with Burton Richter, O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the Stanford Linear Accelerator <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 MeV. At the time, {{this was the}} highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 attometers across. O'Neill considered his device {{to be capable of}} only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction. He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as professor emeritus until his death.|$|E

These excavations were conducted in a site discovered by Akiko Shinya in 2008, FMNH locality UT080821-1, which has been named Akiko's Site in her honor. During the excavations, 167 disarticulated but closely associated elements <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> two plaster jackets. One of these plaster jackets, containing elements from the hip and vertebrae, was given the specimen number FMNH PR 3847; the specimen was subsequently described by McDonald along with Terry Gates, Lindsay Zanno, and Peter Makovicky in 2017.

5|$|The first well-supported {{species of}} Edmontosaurus was named in 1892 as Claosaurus annectens by Othniel Charles Marsh.

Both <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> 1891 by John Bell Hatcher from the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of Niobrara County (then part of Converse County), Wyoming. This species has some historical footnotes attached: it is among the first dinosaurs to receive a skeletal restoration, and is the first hadrosaurid so restored; and YPM2182 and UNSM2414 are, respectively, {{the first and second}} essentially complete mounted dinosaur skeletons in the United States. YPM2182 was put on display in 1901, and USNM2414 in 1904.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant {{is among}} the most {{widespread}} of all insects endemic to Australia. The ant is found throughout Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia. It can be found in most areas of Western Australia but is less common in the north, and is present in the lower regions of the Northern Territory and east of Queensland. They are not present in Tasmania. The green-head ant is an introduced species to New Zealand and was first seen in 1959. Populations of the ant were probably introduced into the country on cargoes of timber; a number of other Rhytidoponera species were most likely introduced the same way. Populations have been established in Napier, as the ants <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>in</b> the town between 2001 and 2003.
