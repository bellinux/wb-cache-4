5|$|As a result, the {{referendum}} on 29 April was categorically rejected with 802,512 votes (42.4%) for abolition and 1,089,193 votes (57.5%) against. This {{would be the}} last attempt to abolish the council and, as the first time the NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941. Heffron's supporter Dougherty resigned from the council a month later in protest of the result.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy. In November, Diệm {{appointed}} Thơ as {{vice president}} {{in an effort to}} widen the regime's popular appeal. The appointment was endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. The move was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Harold Godwinson's {{victory was}} short-lived, {{as only a}} few weeks later he was {{defeated}} by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, in Rome, Emperor Claudius died and was succeeded by his stepson Nero. The Parthian {{encroachment}} {{in an area}} regarded as lying within the Roman sphere of influence worried the Roman leadership, and was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as a major test of the new emperor's ability. Nero reacted vigorously, appointing Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, a general who had distinguished himself in Germania and now served as governor of Asia, to supreme command in the East.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Real Madrid was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as the {{embodiment}} of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War. During the Spanish Civil War, however, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden to the legislature, and by the late 1780s this was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E

5|$|With {{just one}} owned-and-operated station, Paramount's program service never gelled into a true {{television}} network; television historians such as Alex McNeil (1996) consider Paramount programs syndicated rather than network series.

5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as a challenge to the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, {{such as the}} shooting of ten well-known residents of Trøndelag and its environs in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
50|$|The results tend to vary <b>widely</b> (<b>see</b> {{opinion polls}} in Turkey for further information). Opposition parties tend to regard such polls as {{unreliable}} and have presented legislation to Parliament tightening restrictions on how opinion polls conduct their research. After the previous election in June 2015, the polling company ORC issued {{a written statement}} apologising for the inaccuracies in their pre-election polls. KONDA, another polling company, made an apology for similar reasons after their predictions varied widely with the actual result after the 2014 presidential election.|$|R

5|$|Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014), {{originally}} {{known as}} Anthony Wedgwood Benn, but later as Tony Benn, was a British politician, writer, and diarist. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 47 {{years between the}} 1950 and 2001 general elections and a Cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally a moderate, he was identified as being on the party's hard left from the early 1980s, and was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as a key proponent of democratic socialism within the party.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' {{on the one}} hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.|$|E

30|$|Neural {{networks}} (NNs) {{have attracted}} {{a great deal}} of attention because of their extensive applications in various fields such as associative memory, pattern recognition, combinatorial optimization, adaptive control, etc. [1, 2]. Due to the finite switching speed of the amplifiers, time delays are inevitable in electronic implementations of neural networks (such as Hopfield neural networks, cellular neural networks). Time delay in a system is often a source of instability, and delay systems has been <b>widely</b> studied (<b>see</b> [3 – 9] and the references therein). The stability and passivity problems of delayed NNs have been <b>widely</b> reported (<b>see</b> [1, 2, 10 – 14]).|$|R
5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as an improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as {{a victory for the}} proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} thrust twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was <b>widely</b> <b>seen</b> as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E
