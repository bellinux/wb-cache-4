Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is also widespread, with some patches of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and less frequently bell heather (Erica cinerea), cross leaved heath (Erica tetralix) and broom (Cytisus scoparius).|$|E
50|$|Like all fescues, {{the leaves}} are narrow and needle like, making it less {{palatable}} to livestock. The swards that it forms are not as tufted as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) or <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa). The tufted nature is what gives the grass its springy characteristic. The leaves are bright green.|$|E

5000|$|Dry heath {{and acid}} {{grassland}} is found on peripheral {{areas of the}} plateau, the former supporting heather, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> - <b>grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), and with heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) dominating the latter, with mat-grass (Nardus stricta), wavy hair-grass tormentil, (Potentilla erecta) and heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile).|$|R
5000|$|Type 2 is <b>wavy</b> <b>hair,</b> whose {{texture and}} sheen ranges somewhere between {{straight}} and curly <b>hair.</b> <b>Wavy</b> <b>hair</b> {{is also more}} likely to become frizzy than straight hair. While type A waves can easily alternate between straight and curly styles, type B and C <b>Wavy</b> <b>hair</b> is resistant to styling.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} of R to r {{is one of}} no dominance. Heterozygotes (R/r) have <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> that is easily distinguishable from either homozygote. <b>Wavy</b> <b>hair</b> is considered desirable in several breeds, {{but because it is}} heterozygous, these breeds do not breed true for coat type.|$|R
50|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{designated}} area is dominated by <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass,</b> marsh foxtail and creeping bent. The improved grassland is dominated by perennial rye grass, creeping bent and Timothy. The northern section is mostly marshy and comprises rush and sedge species. The marshes also support bog pimpernel and ragged robin. The ditches are significant as they are examples of a disappearing habitat. A wide range of wetland plants flourish with a large population of flote grass and several pondweeds. There are rarities including tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa).|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the site}} {{contains}} free draining soils which support a species-poor dry heath acidic grassland which has been extensively invaded by bracken. The main flora present on the site are heather, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass,</b> bilberry, mat grass, cowberry and other grasses. Similar flora {{is found in the}} English Midlands, however what makes Gentleshaw Common unique is a combination of low altitude and a sunny southern aspect which enables a floristic overlap with heaths typical of the warmer western lowlands of Britain. This florisitic overlap is demonstrated by the abundance of bell heather and western gorse.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the abundance, biomass and microstratification of functional groups of micro- and mesoarthropods inhabiting the organic layers of a Scots pine forest (Pinus sylvestris L.). An experiment using stratified litterbags, containing organic material of four degradation stages, i. e., freshly fallen litter, litter, fragmented litter and humus, was performed {{over a period}} of 2. 5 years. Statistical data analysis revealed that each organic layer had a different, characteristic species composition that changed with time following successive degradation stages. Species of Acari, Araneae and Collembola were assigned to different functional groups based on taxonomy, microstratification, food type or feeding mode. The abundance and biomass carbon of functional groups were dependent on the organic layer and most functional groups showed a particular preference for one of the upper organic layers. Temporal and spatial differences in density and biomass carbon of functional groups could partly be related to fluctuations in the soil climate, although effects of trophic interactions could not be ruled out. A general decline in abundance and biomass, especially in populations of fungal feeders, during the last year of the study could not be explained by a reduction in litterbag volume, changed litter chemistry or soil climate, but was attributed to an indirect effect of a remarkable increase in soil coverage by <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass,</b> Deschampsia flexuosa (L.). The analysis demonstrated that species diversity, microhabitat specification, soil fauna succession, and degradation stages of organic material are interrelated. The results obtained indicate that both the chemistry of organic matter and decomposition rates have an important effect on trophic relationships and community structure...|$|E

Very {{few of them}} have <b>wavy</b> brownish <b>hair.</b> Their skins are generally reported to be light brown.

The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them." ...|$|R
