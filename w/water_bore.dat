At no point along its route does the line cross a permanent fresh water watercourse, so bore water had to be relied on. No inexpensive treatment for the highly mineralised water was available and locomotive boilers were lasting {{less than a quarter}} of the time normally expected. In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total train load was water for the engine. The line's operator, Commonwealth Railways was an early adopter of the diesel-electric locomotive.|$|E

When about {{a hundred}} yards from the spot where the young {{horseman}} stood, it fell with a prolonged roar, and the foam came sweeping in like a white wall, with the dark form of Furby tossing in the midst. The sea rushed furiously upon horse and rider, and the terrified horse, rearing almost perpendicular, wheeled round towards the land. At the same instant the coxswain was hurled against them. Kenneth seized the mane of his steed with one hand, and grasping Furby with the other, held on.

60|$|All {{about them}} the land shook and reeled {{from the shock}} of these {{tremendous}} collisions. At {{the end of an}} hour the run stopped. Somewhere below it was blocked by a jam. Then the river began to rise, lifting the ice on its breast till it was higher than the bank. From behind ever more <b>water</b> <b>bore</b> down, and ever more millions of tons of ice added their weight to the congestion. The pressures and stresses became terrific. Huge cakes of ice were squeezed out till they popped into the air like melon seeds squeezed from between the thumb and forefinger of a child, while all along the banks a wall of ice was forced up. When the jam broke, the noise of grinding and smashing redoubled. For another hour the run continued. The river fell rapidly. But the wall of ice on top the bank, and extending down into the falling water, remained.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{flotation}} of ultrafine pentlandite and its {{separation from}} lizardite in de-ionized <b>water,</b> and <b>bore</b> <b>water</b> of high ionic strength were studied. In de-ionized water, the flotation separation was poor due to low pentlandite recovery and high lizardite entrainment. However, <b>bore</b> <b>water</b> increased pentlandite flotation recovery while reducing lizardite entrainment. The possible mechanisms {{responsible for the}} improved flotation separation in <b>bore</b> <b>water</b> were investigated by electrokinetic studies, Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) analysis and settling tests. It {{was found that the}} reduction of electrical double layer forces between particles in <b>bore</b> <b>water</b> might mitigate the coating of lizardite particles on pentlandite surfaces resulting in the improved pentlandite flotation. The reduction of electrical double layer forces might also induce the aggregation of lizardite particles and therefore enhance lizardite rejection. This study provides a new direction to address slime coating and high gangue entrainment in ultrafine mineral flotation by electrolytes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In far western Thargomindah, late in the 19th century, the civic fathers set up the first natural gas powered generating station in the world. Electricity for lighting was also generated from the pressure of artesian <b>water</b> <b>bores.</b> The use of <b>bore</b> <b>water</b> at Thargomindah {{has been described as}} Australia's first hydro-electricity scheme and operated until 1951.After Thargomindah, Charters Towers received electricity supply in 1897, Rockhampton in 1898, Toowoomba in 1905, Warwick in 1912 and Ayr was supplied in 1914. A number of coal mine in the Ipswich district were generating electricity by the early 1900s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of 34 new heat flow estimates taken in 2004 from 16 <b>water</b> <b>bores</b> and 18 petroleum exploration wells in the western Otway Basin. The average estimated heat flow measured across the study area is 65. 6 ± 9. 4 mW/m 2, with a range of 42 – 90 mW/m 2. There are three recognisable sectors within the study area where heat flow is slightly elevated relative to the background levels. These sectors can be broadly classified as Mount Schank (73. 5 ± 0. 5 mW/m 2), Mount Burr (71. 2 ± 7. 6 mW/m 2) and Beachport (78. 3 ± 10. 4 mW/m 2). Thermal conductivity values for each unit involved in heat flow estimation were determined from laboratory measurements on representative core using a divided bar apparatus. Borehole thermal conductivity profiles were then developed in this study by assigning a constant value of conductivity to each geological formation. The process of collecting temperature data involved measuring temperature profiles for 16 <b>water</b> <b>bores</b> using a cable, winch and thermistor, and compiling well completion temperature data from 18 petroleum wells. The precision of temperature data was higher in the <b>water</b> <b>bores</b> (continuous logs) than in the petroleum wells (largely bottom-of-hole temperature estimates). Inversion heat flow modelling suggests heterogeneous heat flow at 6000 m depth, with two zones where vertical heat flow might exceed 90 mW/m 2, and several zones where vertical heat flow might be as low as 40 mW/m 2. Therefore, while slightly higher surface heat flow does coincide with some of the volcanic centres, heterogeneous basement heat production is a more likely explanation, as there are no heat flow anomalies greater than 5 – 10 mW/m 2 associated with the Pleistocene–Recent Newer Volcanics Province. The distribution of heat flow in south-east South Australia is most simply explained by non-volcanic phenomena. Chris Matthews, Graeme Beardsmore, Jim Driscoll and Nicky Pollingto...|$|R
