5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of lookâ€”the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
