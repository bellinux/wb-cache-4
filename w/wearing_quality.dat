40|$|Quality is a multi-dimensional {{concept and}} can be viewed from {{different}} perspectives (Fiore &Kimle, 1997 : 5). From the professional women’s (consumer) perspective career <b>wear</b> <b>quality</b> can be measured on both tangible (functional or sensory) and non-tangible (emotional, cognitive and importance {{of the self and}} others) levels. From the retailer’s perspective quality is measured mostly based on intrinsic product features (durability), thus relating to one component of career <b>wear</b> <b>quality</b> of professional women. The discrepancy between the two may result in consumer dissatisfaction and impacts negatively on return sales to the retailer. Quality evaluation occurs at two stages during the consumer decision making process. Firstly, quality is evaluated in-store, during the decision-making stage, and secondly during product use. The quality indicators that professional women use during these stages may not be the same. In this study an exploration was thus done on the tangible and non-tangible quality indicators that professional women use to evaluate career <b>wear</b> <b>quality</b> both during the purchase decision-making stage and during product use. Each of these was measured according to its importance to the respondents during the decision-making stage and during product use and subsequently compared, since the importance of quality indicators may differ between the two stages. The systems theory approach was used to compile the conceptual framework for this study. The systems perspective acknowledges the sequence, relationship and interdependency of the individual indicators that are used to evaluate clothing products. These indicators are considered as so-called inputs and are transformed in terms of outputs, which are interpreted in terms of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The respondents were full-time employed professional women in the legal, financial, engineering and medical industries, as these women require the suitable qualification and registration with the appropriate professional body. This group has spending power and their third largest household expenditure is clothing products. A snowball technique was used to recruit participants/respondents for both the qualitative phase, during which a focus group was held, and for the quantitative data collection (questionnaire) phase. The qualitative technique (focus group) was used to gain insight into the exact quality indicators and specific terminology the target population uses when evaluating career <b>wear</b> <b>quality</b> during the purchase decision making stage and during product use. The questionnaire was compiled against the theoretical background and the information gained from the focus group. Through the use of t-tests and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient it was found that respondents used similar quality indicators to evaluate career <b>wear</b> <b>quality</b> both during the decision-making stage and during product use. Tangible quality indicators were seen as significantly more important than non-tangible quality indicators to respondents during both stages of quality evaluation. Appropriate and adequate information regarding tangible quality indicators must thus be made available by retailers to professional women at the point of purchase. This may ensure consumer satisfaction during product use and facilitate return sales for the retailer. Dissertation (MConsumer Science) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Journal {{bearings}} {{are applied}} in internal combustion engines {{due to their}} favourable <b>wearing</b> <b>quality</b> and operating characteristics. Under certain operating conditions damage of the journal bearing can occur caused by cavitation. The cavitation reduces the load capacity and leads to material erosion. Experimental investigations of cavitating flows in dimension of real journal bearing are difficult to realize or almost impossible caused by the small gap and transient flow conditions. Therefore numerical simulation is a very helpful engineering tool to research the cavitation behaviour. The CFD-Code OpenFOAM is used to analyse the flow field inside the bearing. The numerical cavitation model based on a bubble dynamic approach and requires necessary initial parameter for the calculation, such as nuclei bubble diameter, the number of nuclei and two empirical constants. The {{first part of this}} paper shows the influence of these parameters on the solution. For the adjustment of the parameters an experiment of Jakobsson et. al. [1] was used to validate the numerical flow model. The parameters have been varied according to the method Design of Experiments (DoE). With a defined model equation the parameters determined, to identify the parameter for CFD-calculations in comparison to the experimental values.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of cavitation {{is still a}} problem in technical and industrial applications. Especially in automotive internal combustion engines, hydrodynamic journal bearings are used due to their favourable <b>wearing</b> <b>quality</b> and operating characteristics. Cavitation flows inside the bearings reduces the load capacity and leads to a risk of material damages. Therefore {{an understanding of the}} complex flow phenomena inside the bearing is necessary for the design development of hydrodynamic journal bearings. Experimental investigations in the fluid domain of the journal bearing are difficult to realize founded by the small dimensions of the bearing. In the recent years more and more the advantages of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are used to investigate the detail of the cavitation flows. The analysis in the paper is carried out in a two-step approach. At first an experimental investigation of journal bearing including cavitation is selected from the literature. The complex numerical model validated with the experimental measured data. In a second step, typically design parameters, such as a groove and feed hole, which are necessary to distribute the oil supply across the gap were added into the model. The paper reflects on the influence of the used design parameters and the variation of the additional supply flow rate through the feed hole regarding to cavitation effects in the bearing. Detailed pictures of the three-dimensional flow structures and the cavitation regions inside the flow film of the bearing are presented...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the 3 rd Micro and Nano Flows Conference (MNF 2011), which was held at the Makedonia Palace Hotel, Thessaloniki in Greece. The conference was organised by Brunel University and supported by the Italian Union of Thermofluiddynamics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, University of Thessaly, IPEM, the Process Intensification Network, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Heat Transfer Society, HEXAG - the Heat Exchange Action Group, and the Energy Institute. Hydrodynamic journal bearings are widely used in technical and industrial applications due to their favourable <b>wearing</b> <b>quality</b> and operating characteristics. In the recent years, various experimental and numerical analyses were carried out on the design layout, the load capacity and the durability of the bearing. For typical applications the two-dimensional Reynolds differential equation is solved numerically to calculate the pressure distribution in the oil film, which is essential to simulate the dynamic behavior of the bearing. This approach however, does not allow any detailed predictions of the local three-dimensional flow structures. To understand the mechanisms, which are driven by local flow phenomena, it is necessary to solve the full Navier-Stokes-Equations in 3 D together with the conservation of mass. An accurate computation of a three-dimensional flow field requires a careful discretisation of the model. Moreover, only a deliberately chosen meshing based on the optimum number of cells across the gap achieves a sufficient numerical accuracy with acceptable computational effort. This work presents variations of the mesh generation of small gaps in journal bearing models and the computed flow fields, respectively. The threedimensional calculations are validated with measured experimental data done by Laser-Doppler-Velocimetry (LDV). In conclusion of this process the comparison of the velocity profiles of the flow field across the gap yield the necessary numerical discretisation limit applicable to the computation of the flow in journal bearings...|$|E

Surface integrity involves the study of surface roughness, metallurgical alterations and microhardness tests. The end of tool life was reached because of catastrophic failure of the drill, but no significant progressive wear in cutting zone was observed previously. High hole quality was observed even near tool catastrophic failure, evaluated {{from the point of view}} of dimensions, surface roughness and burr height.
