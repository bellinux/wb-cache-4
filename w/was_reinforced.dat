5|$|The top tower {{along the}} front wall of the forward compound, tower 6, has a square base which <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> with a six-sided foundation. Working west, the square base of tower 7 <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> with a {{circular}} foundation. Tower 8, on the upper side of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding {{the other side is}} tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.|$|E
5|$|Tilbury Fort, {{also known}} {{historically}} as the Thermitage Bulwark and the West Tilbury Blockhouse, is an artillery fort {{on the north}} bank of the River Thames in England. The earliest version of the fort, comprising a small blockhouse with artillery covering the river, was constructed by King Henry VIII to protect London against attack from France {{as part of his}} Device programme. It <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> during the 1588 Spanish Armada invasion scare, after which it <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> with earthwork bastion, and Parliamentary forces used it to help secure the capital during the English Civil War of the 1640s. Following naval raids during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the fort was enlarged by Sir Bernard de Gomme from 1670 onwards to form a star-shaped defensive work, with angular bastions, water-filled moats and two lines of guns facing onto the river.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943. This advance was mounted {{to divert attention}} from Lae, {{which was one of the}} main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded slowly. In late June the 3rd Division <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{sequence of}} prompt and probe trials {{was used to}} teach picture names to three severely retarded children. On prompt trials the experimenter presented a picture and said the picture name {{for the child to}} imitate; on probe trials the experimenter did not name the picture. A procedure whereby correct responses to prompts and probes <b>were</b> nondifferentially <b>reinforced</b> <b>was</b> compared with procedures whereby correct responses to prompts and probes <b>were</b> differentially <b>reinforced</b> according to separate and independent schedules of primary reinforcement. In Phase 1, correct responses to prompts and probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> nondifferentially on a fixed ratio (FR) 6 or 8 schedule; in Phase 2, correct responses to prompts <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on the FR schedule and correct responses to probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on an FR schedule of the same value; in Phase 3, correct responses to prompts <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on the FR schedule and correct responses to probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on a continuous reinforcement (CRF; every correct response reinforced) schedule; in Phase 4, correct responses to prompts <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on a CRF schedule and correct responses to probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on the FR schedule; in Phase 5, a reversal to the conditions of Phase 3 was conducted. For all three children, the FR schedule for correct responses to prompts combined with the CRF schedule for correct responses to probes (Phases 3 and 5) generated the highest number of correct responses to probes, the highest accuracy (correct responses relative to correct responses plus errors) on probe trials, and the highest rate of learning to name pictures...|$|R

5|$|Around 3 August García {{moved his}} entire army forward to Chunpich, and by October Spanish {{soldiers}} had established themselves near {{the source of}} the San Pedro River. By November Tzuktok' was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki. In December 1695 the main force <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> with 250 soldiers, of which 150 were Spanish and pardo and 100 were Maya, together with labourers and muleteers.|$|E
5|$|Around Gacko and Avtovac in the north, the day {{had been}} quiet. When the {{commander}} of the 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion at Gacko reported rebels gathering near the town, Prpić sent a truck-mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply. The platoon was ambushed en route, with 14 Home Guardsmen being captured. Gacko <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> later in the day from troops in Avtovac. On the night of 26 June, the Nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels, but held out.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was occupied by Captain Richard Swanley, a supporter of Parliament. In December 1648 it was briefly used to detain the King before his trial and execution. During the interregnum, it remained in use under the command of Colonel Thomas Eyre and <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> in 1650 to deal with the threat of a Royalist invasion.|$|E

The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban on a number of other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{was touched}} by the lot of poor {{children}} in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> by {{a visit to the}} Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.|$|E
5|$|During the War of the Roses between 1455 and 1485, fought by {{the rival}} factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, Conwy <b>was</b> <b>reinforced,</b> but played little {{part in the}} fighting. Henry VIII {{conducted}} restoration work in the 1520s and 1530s, during which time the castle was {{being used as a}} prison, a depot and as a potential residence for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Henry VIII allied {{himself with}} Spain {{in a war}} against France. Despite Henry's initial successes, France and Spain made peace in 1544, leaving England exposed to a French invasion, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response, Henry issued an {{instruction}} to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Dartmouth Castle <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> by three new gun batteries, two {{either side of the}} gun tower, and another, Lamberd's Bulwarke, positioned in the south-east corner of the fortalice.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Australian {{military}} <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> by units recalled {{from the}} Middle East and {{an expansion of}} the CMF and RAAF. United States Military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea. The Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1914, the German Foreign Office and members of the {{military}} suggested attempting to use the pan-Islamic movement to destabilise the British Empire and begin an Indian revolution. The argument <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> by Germanophile explorer Sven Hedin in Berlin two weeks later. General Staff memoranda in the last weeks of August confirmed the perceived feasibility of the plan, predicting that an invasion by Afghanistan could cause a revolution in India.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
