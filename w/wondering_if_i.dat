Hilary Hughes of Fuse praised it as {{a return to the}} band's old sound, saying [...] "a {{promising}} look at what's sure to be a satisfying listen for new and old fans alike." [...] Ian Rogers from The Vine commented that it [...] "Sounds exactly like a highly professional, crassly commercial L.A. rock band performing a Weezer-styled song about Weezer returning to their roots." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Concentrate and Ask Again" [...] {{featured}} {{guest star}} Omid Abtahi as telepathic Simon Phillips, his only {{credit for the}} series. Guest actor Kevin Corrigan returned as recurring character Sam Weiss. The episode featured guest stars Jody Thompson and Paul Jarrett as the new characters Sara Downey and Warren Blake, respectively. Thompson called the part [...] "the kind of role that actors dream of". She described the episode, [...] "The material was so compelling and perfectly written {{it was a matter}} of not getting in the way of what the creators had created. I’m anxious about how it will come off. Truthfully, I’ve been torturing myself, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have somehow ruined the beauty of what I read in the script".|$|E
500|$|Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it {{was then}} known, was {{performed}} in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 – {{more than a year before}} its release – at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as [...] "...bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning." [...] Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote [...] "The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast." [...] Melody Maker was, however, less enthusiastic: [...] "Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was in a bird-cage at London zoo." [...] However, the following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version, and the recorded version released a year later, included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as [...] "On the Run", and Bible readings that were later replaced by Clare Torry's non-lexical vocables on [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky".|$|E

500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
2500|$|The band's third self-titled studio album – {{commonly}} referred to as The Red Album – was released in June 2008 as their sixth studio album. The album peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. The first single from the album, [...] "Pork and Beans", spent 11 weeks {{at the top of the}} Alternative Songs chart. Two of the three succeeding singles from the album, [...] "Troublemaker" [...] and [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)", peaked at numbers two and 35 on the chart respectively. Raditude, the band's seventh studio album, was released in November 2009 and peaked at number 7 on the Billboard 200. It was preceded by the release of its lead single, [...] "(If You're <b>Wondering</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Want You To) I Want You To", which peaked at number two on the Alternative Songs chart. Weezer released Hurley, their eighth studio album, in September 2010. The album, their first to be released through Epitaph Records, peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and spawned two singles, [...] "Memories" [...] and [...] "Hang On". Shortly after releasing Hurley, the band released a compilation album titled Death to False Metal in November 2010. An album consisting of previously unreleased tracks recorded at several points throughout Weezer's career, Death to False Metal peaked at number 48 on the Billboard 200. Worldwide album sales have been verified through RIAA and Geffen Records.|$|E
