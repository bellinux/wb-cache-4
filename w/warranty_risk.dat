40|$|We {{consider}} a repairable product with known market entry and departure times. A warranty policy is offered with product purchase, under which a customer {{can have a}} failed item repaired free of charge in the warranty period. It is assumed that customers are heterogeneous in their risk attitudes toward uncertain repair costs incurred after the warranty expires. The objective is to determine a joint dynamic pricing and warranty policy for the lifetime of the product, which maximizes the manufacturer's expected profit. In {{the first part of}} the analysis, we {{consider a}} linearly decreasing price function and a constant warranty length. We first study customers' purchase patterns under several different pricing strategies by the manufacturer and then discuss the optimal pricing and warranty strategy. In the second part, we assume that the warranty length can be altered once during the product lifetime in developing a joint pricing and warranty policy. Numerical studies show that a dynamic warranty policy can significantly outperform a fixed-length warranty policy. Dynamic pricing Dynamic <b>warranty</b> <b>Risk</b> aversion...|$|E
40|$|Why is it {{that some}} {{products}} carry a minimal manufacturer base warranty even though all consumers are risk-averse? Conventional wisdom {{suggests that it is}} profitable for the manufacturer to offer a comprehensive warranty in this setting. We provide in this paper an explanation for the provision of minimal warranty in markets where all consumers are risk-averse. Minimal warranties are created by the impact of consumer moral hazard and competition in the insurance after-market for the product. We show that consumers who purchase optional extended warranties from an independent provider of insurance create a significant negative externality on the warranty redemption costs of the manufacturer. This, in turn, creates a significant erosion in the manufacturer's profits from warranty insurance. Consequently, it {{is in the best interest}} of the manufacturer to drop the level of warranty coverage provided with the product. This intuition holds for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous markets of consumers. game theory, pricing research, <b>warranties,</b> <b>risk</b> aversion, service contracts, moral hazard...|$|R

50|$|In {{catastrophe}} {{excess of}} loss, the cedant's retention {{is usually a}} multiple of the underlying policy limits, and the reinsurance contract usually contains a two <b>risk</b> <b>warranty</b> (i.e. {{they are designed to}} protect the cedant against catastrophic events that involve more than one policy, usually very many policies). For example, an insurance company issues homeowners' policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover from reinsurers in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{assurance}} of longer reliable service life and greater customer peace of mind, products with a lifetime warranty {{are becoming more}} and more popular. Under such policies, both the manufacturer and the buyer are exposed to uncertainties and <b>risks</b> of <b>warranty</b> pricing and product performance since product lifetimes are uncertain and are not well defined in these policies. Considering the uncertainties in the measure of lifetime (useful life), this paper extends previous work of the authors [Rahman, A., & Chattopadhay, G. N. (2010). Modelling risks to manufacturer and buyer for lifetime warranty policies. International Journal of Management Science and Engineering Management, 5, 203 – 209] to determine the optimal <b>warranty</b> price. <b>Risk</b> preference models are developed to find the optimal warranty price through the use of the manufacturer’s utility function for profit and the buyer’s utility function for repair costs. The sensitivity of the risk preferences models are analysed using numerical examples with respect to factors such as the buyer’s and the manufacturer/dealer’s risk preferences, the buyer’s anticipated and the manufacturer’s estimated product failure intensity, the buyer’s loyalty to the original manufacturer/dealer in repairing failed products, and the buyer’s repair costs for non-warrantied products. Analysis of the developed models reveals that the manufacturer’s decisions on warranty price are strictly related to useful life, failure intensity of the product, and risk preferences. On the other hand, the buyer’s acceptance of a lifetime warranty depends on the expected lifetime of the product, the buyer’s anticipated product failure intensity, anticipated repair costs, and most importantly the buyer’s risk preference.

40|$|Reliability {{demonstration}} testing {{is not the}} most efficient method of assuring product reliability prior to shipment. It is costly, time consuming and has inherent technical and social limitations. The dilemma facing the reliability and quality engineer is whether to continue {{demonstration testing}} and risk shipping a product late or ship the product and <b>risk</b> <b>warranty</b> and field service returns. Either option can cause the company to lose significant market share and profit. This paper sets out to solve this dilemma by meeting both the time to market constraints and the product reliability goals. The weaknesses of existing reliability demonstration techniques are explored and a comprehensive methodology is introduced involving controlled development processes, stress testing, root cause determination and process change feedback mechanisms. All prototype products are manufactured on the final volume process line resulting in the early identification and correction of processrelated problems. Testing commences on the first available prototypes with system stress/robust testing being employed to stimulate failures, determine their root cause and correct them.

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to admit a business under a leasing contract? If no problems arise in the leasing contract {{because it is an}} unregulated contract, questions are raised by the business. In fact, leasing is a flexible contract that may concern any type of good and that can be adapted to any kind of concern between the contract parties. On the contrary, business is a complex and mutable reality. It’s composed not only of tangible assets, but even of intangible assets, as well as of a whole string of juridical situations. Moreover, business is in continous development: business value estimation and goodwill can increase or go down, goods can become obsolete, even within a brief period of usage. Furthermore, business transfer produces results not only between the lessee and the lessor but also between others involved in the legal transaction. Finally, the Italian civil code disciplines only company (business) sales, usufruct and renting, meaning that it’s very difficult to ascertain if our law allows different modalities of business transfer apart from those specified. So how can contract leasing and business discipline be combine? Firstly, it’s necessary to solve the business leasing configuration problem. It’s important to establish (1) if it is possible, both in theory and in practice, to make such an agreement, especially concerning intangible assets and all juridical situations connected with business, and (2) if it is possible to conceive of a leasing in which a business, considered as one entity, is admitted or if it is necessary to sign a leasing contract for every single business component. This is not such a simple problem to solve. In fact, the main practical obstacle is the so-called investment risk. Who takes it? If the business isn’t bought by the lessee {{at the end of the}} contract, it returns to the lessor and even if it isn’t used and exploited, it produces results and needs to be managed. So who’s responsibility is it to manage it? The lessor, another new lessee, another new contract party, perhaps a guarantor? Furthermore what about its status after the return to the lessor and before a next potential transfer? What about contracts, credits, debts, intangible assets, management <b>risk,</b> <b>warranties</b> and of a ban on competition? Moreover, to whom will business management advantages and disadvantages be related? How can they be connected to the lessor or to the lessee or to a third contractual leasing party, perhaps a guarantor? Also, if there is a succession of lessees and business managements, how should they be considered? Should they be considered separately or as one complex management? What about customers, suppliers, workers and others related to the business in general? How is {{it possible}} to safeguard their interests? Perhaps is {{it possible to}} create a uniform manage trend? Only after having solved these problems, is it possible to analyze, in every single detail, leasing contractual structure (both objective and subjective), due diligence, business value estimation, contract performance and business credit, debt and contract succession, hypothesis and remedies of breach of contract and discharge, bankrupted results, business return regime (structure and results), accounting and fiscal aspects. An analytic analysis is reserved for the role of the guarantor and for the business management trend as the main and essential features of business leasing contract. The whole treatise is completed with a general part concerning the leasing contract and the business (especially intangible assets and business transfer rules) with specific references to legal doctrine and jurisprudence, both Italian and foreign (French, Spanish and English) and to practical commercial cases...|$|R
