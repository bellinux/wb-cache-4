These longer lines often required public subscription to build and crossed over land not owned by the mine owners.

2500|$|Although Acts of Parliament allowed railway {{companies}} {{compulsory purchase}} of <b>wayleave,</b> some powerful landowners objected to railways being built across {{their land and}} raised objections in Parliament to prevent the bill from being passed. [...] Some landowners charged excessive amounts, so these early lines did not always follow the optimal route. In addition steep gradients were to be avoided (they would require more powerful locomotives), (while speeds {{were expected to be}} less than about 30mph, curves were considered less of a problem. It was the curves on these early lines that, a century later, would lead to British Railways' experimentation with, and later introduction of, tilting trains.|$|E

2500|$|The Central London Railway (CLR) {{was given}} {{permission}} in 1891 for a tube line between Shepherd's Bush and a station at Cornhill, {{and the following}} year an extension to Liverpool Street was authorised, with a station at Bank instead of at Cornhill. The line was built following the streets above rather than running underneath buildings, because purchase of <b>wayleave</b> under private properties would have been expensive, {{and as a result}} one line runs above another in places, with platforms at different levels at St Paul's, Chancery Lane and Notting Hill Gate stations. The tunnels were bored with the nominal diameter of , increased on curves, reduced to [...] near to stations. The tunnels generally rise approaching a station, to aid braking, and fall when leaving, to aid acceleration.|$|E
2500|$|In 1765 George Chalmers of Edinburgh {{tried to}} persuade the Earl to grant a <b>wayleave</b> for a waggonway to replace the road transport. He had been to great trouble to {{discover}} the best Newcastle method, and wrote: [...] "I suppose we can have people from Bo'ness or Carron who can make the waggons of a proper size and probably one which will hold 2½ tons of coals may be sufficient for about 3 tons of limestone." [...] He said he would consult William Brown of Throckley. In 1769 Chalmers wrote to Ralph Carr of Newcastle saying that a five-mile waggonway over rough terrain had been surveyed but that he wanted Mr Brown's advice. Chalmers' ambitions were partly realised when a short line was built at Limekilns to serve the kilns themselves, and a wooden waggonway was built from limestone quarries and coal pits at Berrylaw (west of Dunfermline) to the coast at Limekilns.|$|E

50|$|Even so, {{crossing}} {{undeveloped land}} by cart {{was slow and}} difficult, and waggonways were developed; at first they consisted of wooden rails, and individual wagons were hauled along the route by horse traction. In {{the course of time}} a considerable number of such waggonways were constructed in the area. The waggonways too required <b>wayleaves</b> to traverse privately held land.|$|R
50|$|The mineral {{could be}} {{conveyed}} to a quay by cart. Even {{in the early}} decades of the nineteenth century there were very few public roads, and the carts made their way across private land, paying a <b>wayleave</b> to the landowner. The <b>wayleave</b> was a contract for permission to cross the land in return for a payment, usually on the basis of a rate per unit of weight.|$|E
50|$|Sir Arthur's {{father died}} in 1897 and he {{inherited}} Dove Leys, where he began to build another railway between the road, {{where there was a}} coal store, and the house. His intention was to extend to Norbury railway goods yard, but Colonel Clowes who owned the land in between refused to give him <b>wayleave.</b> Sir Arthur then extended the line southwards to nearby Dove Cliff farm, which was part of his estate, and thence to Rocester station. However he was again unable to obtain <b>wayleave</b> from his other neighbour, Colonel Dawson.|$|E

50|$|On 16 April 1835, {{the railway}} began to carry passengers, between South Shields and Durham Road, near {{the corner of}} Lambton Park. At first this was free of charge in coal wagons, but later in open {{carriages}} attached to the coal trains. The landowners now demanded higher charges for the <b>wayleaves</b> {{on the grounds that}} the earlier arrangement had been for the carriage of minerals only.|$|R
50|$|A {{servitude}} is {{a qualified}} beneficial interest severed or fragmented from {{the ownership of}} an inferior property (servient estate) and attached to a superior property (dominant estate) or to some person (personal beneficiary) other than the owner. At civil law, ownership (dominium) is the only full real right whereas a servitude is a subordinate real right on par with <b>wayleaves,</b> real burdens (i.e. real covenants), security interests, and reservations. There are two types: predial, attaching to property, and personal, attaching to a person.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the waggonway {{led to a}} legal dispute: Clavering had {{contracts}} for <b>wayleaves</b> for conveying coal to the Tyne by [...] "carts or wains, and did not include waggons" [...] (that is, waggonway vehicles). This made the waggonway unusable, and frustration among coal owners generally {{led to the formation}} of a powerful group known informally as the Grand Allies: Hon. Sidney Wortley Montagu, his son, the Hon. Edward Wortley Montagu, and Thomas Ord, of Newcastle upon Tyne; Sir Henry Liddell and Colonel George Liddell of Ravensworth Castle; and George Bowes, of Gibside.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the scheme}} was {{now to be}} a {{considerable}} railway with an estimated capital of £150,000, {{in the interests of}} keeping confidential the rich mineral resources to be exploited, the company decided to continue the practice of arranging wayleaves rather than applying to Parliament for authority to build the line. In the event this resulted in massive charges being demanded by the landowners on the eastern section, averaging £300 a mile annually. The wild hills of the western section were less useful agriculturally and the <b>wayleave</b> fees were considerably less. Nonetheless the annual <b>wayleave</b> charge was about £5,600. Most of the capital required for the construction was found by London financiers.|$|E
50|$|Realising the {{enormous}} commercial potential, BR Telecommunications Limited (BRT) {{was created in}} 1992 to exploit its <b>wayleave</b> rights and {{to take responsibility for}} the management and maintenance of the industry’s voice, data and radio networks associated with the operational running of the railway and its business needs.|$|E
50|$|In 1758 the Brandlings {{had built}} a wooden wagonway to carry coal into Leeds, using horse-drawn vehicles, {{now known as the}} Middleton Railway. Not all the land traversed by the wagonway belonged to Brandling, {{and it was the first}} railway to be {{authorised}} by Act of Parliament, since this would give him power to obtain <b>wayleave.</b>|$|E

50|$|The BG&HR company {{approached}} {{the owners of}} Tanfield Lea Colliery on 2 July 1834, for the carriage of their coals: the Railway Company would take over the Tanfield Lea waggonway from its junction with the South Moor Colliery line to the Pit, paying the <b>wayleaves,</b> etc., and carrying the coals from the Bute Pit to Hebburn Quay for 5s. 9d. per chaldron. An agreement was subsequently drawn up on these lines binding the Company to relay the old Tanfield and Tanfield Lea waggonways, thus making a new branch about 6 miles in length, before 31 December 1836.|$|R
60|$|The Tonga {{natives of}} the neighbourhood, who had burned {{most of the}} {{woodwork}} {{in order to secure}} the precious iron bolts and fittings, informed us that the white man and his servants who were with the wagon had gone forward on foot some ten days before, driving their cattle with them. Whether this story were true or not we had no means of finding out. It was quite possible that Pereira and his companions had been murdered, though as we found the Tongas very quiet folk if well treated and given the usual complimentary presents for <b>wayleaves,</b> this did not seem probable. Indeed, a week later our doubts upon this point were cleared up thus.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there appear}} to have been earlier waggonways from the high ground around Tanfield, the most notable line was the [...] of 1725, from Tanfield Moor to Dunston, on the Tyne. This line had several rope-worked inclines, with more {{moderate}} gradients operated by horse traction. The rails were timber. In commercial terms it was remarkably successful, although <b>wayleave</b> charges (imposed by landowners) were heavy.|$|E
50|$|To avoid <b>wayleave</b> {{payments}} to property owners and to lessen possible claims for damage during construction and operation, the CLR tunnels were directly under public streets. This caused the platforms under Threadneedle Street and Poultry {{to be so}} curved that {{one end of the}} platform cannot be seen from the other. East of Bank station the Central line tunnels have sharp curves to avoid the vaults of the Bank of England itself.|$|E

50|$|The Croesor Valley is {{bleak and}} remote, even today, {{but in the}} 1860s the Croesor Tramway was {{constructed}} along it, to facilitate the transport of slate products from Rhosydd Quarry and Croesor Quarry {{at the head of}} the valley. The tramway was built without Parliamentary authority in two parts, a section from Porthmadog to a rocky outcrop at Carreg-Hylldrem, to the north-west of the hamlet of Llanfrothen, which was constructed by obtaining a series of <b>Wayleaves,</b> and a continuation eastwards, beginning with the two Parc inclines, which was effectively a private tramway, as it was built on land leased by various quarry owners. It opened for traffic on 1 August 1864, when the first four loaded wagons of slates from Rhosydd Quarry were conveyed to Porthmadog.|$|R
50|$|A railway between Newcastle and North Shields was {{proposed}} in 1830, but was opposed in Newcastle {{by people who}} feared that the city docks would lose trade to docks at North Shields and in North Shields by people who feared local shops would lose trade when customers could travel to Newcastle and that no-one would holiday in North Shields if they could stay in Newcastle. Of the two proposed routes one was chosen in 1835, changed the following year so Tynemouth was on the main line rather than served by a branch. To compensate landowners for the lost income from <b>wayleaves</b> on coal carried on the existing wagonways, a toll of d a mile was agreed. The Newcastle and North Shields Railway (N&NSR) received Royal Assent on 21 June 1836.|$|R
50|$|Early in 1831, Pontop Colliery (a landsale pit) at Medomsley was advertised to be let. William Wallis of Westoe (near South Shields) {{found the}} {{potential}} attractive {{and later in}} the year he agreed leases of coal seams at West Consett and Medomsley, and limestone quarries at Stanhope. A railway would be needed to connect those places, and a partnership was formed. They arranged <b>wayleaves</b> to get their line from Consett to Stanhope, avoiding the expense of obtaining a Parliamentary Act. Stanhope was the location of extensive reserves of limestone, required in the process of smelting iron ore. At this stage the plan was to use the Tanfield Waggonway to transport the materials to the Tyne. As well as the limestone quarries at Stanhope, there were limekilns, producing quicklime.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wayleave</b> {{system was}} firmly {{entrenched in the}} area at the time, and the {{brothers}} {{did not apply to}} purchase land, but to use wayleaves, for which they had arranged contracts, paying £2,069 annually. In the following year the brothers obtained the incorporation of a company (as opposed to their personal rights) to undertake the work; on 7 June 1836 the Brandling Junction Railway was incorporated. The wayleaves were now valued at £3,434 which the company paid the brothers, so that they acquired a 70% mark-up.|$|E
50|$|There were bridges {{over one}} or two streams, the longest being 28 ft, but it crossed roadways on the level, {{at one point the}} main Wrexham to Chester road. Although Heywood had {{obtained}} <b>wayleave,</b> it could only be a temporary arrangement, since, for a private railway, the council was not able to enter in an agreement which bound its successors. Heywood therefore campaigned for a clause in the proposed Light Railway Bill which would allow permission for public road crossings to be granted in perpetuity.|$|E
5000|$|The Middleton Railway, {{the first}} railway {{to be granted}} powers by Act of Parliament, carried coal cheaply from the Middleton pits to the Staith at Casson Close, Leeds (near Meadow Lane, close to the River Aire). Not all the land belonged to Brandling, and the Act gave him power to obtain <b>wayleave.</b> Otherwise the line was privately financed and operated, {{initially}} as a waggonway using horse-drawn waggons. Around 1799 the wooden tracks began to be replaced with superior iron edge rails to a gauge of [...]|$|E
50|$|An {{encumbrance}} {{is a right}} to, interest in, {{or legal}} liability on real property that does not prohibit passing title to the property but that diminishes its value. Encumbrances can be classified in several ways. They may be financial (ex: liens) or non-financial (ex: easements, private restrictions). Alternatively, they may be divided into those that affect title (ex: lien, legal or equitable charge) or those that affect the use or physical condition of the encumbered property (ex: restrictions, easements, encroachments). Encumbrances include security interests, liens, servitudes (e.g. easements, <b>wayleaves,</b> real covenants, profits a prendre), leases, restrictions, encroachments, and air and subsurface rights. Also, those considered as potentially making the title defeasible are encumbrances, e.g. charging orders, building orders and structure alteration. Encumbrance: charge upon or claim against land arising out of private grant or a contract.|$|R

Bills for three similarly inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 legislative session, and, to ensure a consistent approach, a Joint Select Committee was established to review the proposals.

The rest of the route was approved and, following a change of the company name, the bill received royal assent on 24 August 1893 as the Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Act, 1893.|$|R
