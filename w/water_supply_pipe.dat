50|$|When the Hutt City Council {{wanted to}} {{construct}} a new wastewater treatment plant at Seaview in the 1990s, they attempted to secure access to the Wainuiomata Tunnel to build the sewer pipeline to connect the new plant to Wainuiomata.

50|$|In the isopod's {{natural habitat}} the thermal waters ranged in {{temperature}} from 26 - 33 C. In 1947, when the spring was diverted {{to supply the}} city of Socorro with drinking water, the isopods ended up living in an old <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> {{that led to a}} horse trough and two small, old, concrete bathing pools. In 1988, the wild population became extinct, when a tree root burst the pipe and cut off water flow to the concrete pools. Existing captive populations were bred to restore the isopod community near the spring and they were reintroduced, into eight new concrete pools (tanks). As of 2006, captive populations are kept at the Albuquerque Biological Park, the Minnesota Zoo, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish Laboratory in Santa Fe, and by the Department of Biology at New Mexico Tech.|$|E
50|$|The {{restoration}} of the Roman Aqua Virgo aqueduct in 1570 was immediately followed {{by the start of}} work on a continuation <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> towards the district of the old Campo Marzio, which following the diminution of the city's size and importance was left as the most densely populated part of the city. Restoration of a piped water supply in turn permitted the construction of several public fountains. The basin of the Fontana del Nettuno, (without the sculptures) was designed in 1574 by Giacomo Della Porta, who was also responsible for the Moor Fountain at {{the other side of the}} square. It was sponsored by pope Gregory XIII. The lower part of the basin consists of white marble and the upper part of the local stone from Pietrasanta.

50|$|The {{proposed}} {{site had}} been {{classified as a}} Private Conservation Area (Sanctuary) since 1958 but this was revoked by the Tasmanian State Government in 2007 (under section 21 of the Nature Conservation Act 2002).

Industry already located at Bell Bay includes an aluminum smelter, a metallurgical plant, a gas-fired thermal power station (decommissioned), a recently commissioned combined cycle gas turbine power station and a saw-milling and wood chipping facility. Included in the proposed development is construction of a large warehouse and wharf north of and not within the Tamar River Conservation Area {{as well as the}} installation of a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> to be drilled under or 'jet trenched' into the bed of the Tamar River in order to cross it.

5000|$|The 1968 {{event was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held inside the Orange County Fairgrounds in an outdoor pavilion. The fairgrounds are on Newport Boulevard, just {{a short distance from}} Newport Beach (hence the name). The 1968 event's advance ticket sales were triple of what was expected, and it became evident that no area inside the fairgrounds could hold even 25,000 people, let alone the near 100,000 now predicted. In the last three days before the show, it was moved to one of the adjoining parking lots of the fairgrounds. Fencing, staging, sanitation, and food concessions had to be organized within just three days. Fencing in some areas consisted of wire blankets and/or tarps thrown over as a visual block. People without tickets on the outside would [...] "storm the fence" [...] and got in for free. None of the commercial concessionaires were prepared for the event, and they all ran out of food and drink halfway through the first day. Water was provided throughout the event by garden hoses from inside the fairgrounds, but attendees had to provide their own containers and give up their viewing spot to reach the water. A broken <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> provided a mud bath that a number of people jumped in, but people realized that the sun would bake the mud into a hard cover, so they stopped. There were plenty of porta-potties available {{at the rear of the}} hastily assembled [...] "grounds." [...] There was no shade in the primary viewing area, and partiers were sunburned. The weather was a typical August day in sunny Southern California. Those without hotel reservations had no place to stay. Fortunately, city officials alleviated some of the problems by designating a 32 acre area of the fairgrounds as an emergency campsite. They also brought in portable toilets and water tanks. This particular event launched some of the problems rock festival promoters would face in the future.|$|E
