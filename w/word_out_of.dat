We started out trying to record the vocals together, but George drove Tammy crazy with his phrasing. He never, ever did {{it the same way}} twice. He could make a five-syllable <b>word</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 'church.' Finally, Tammy said, 'Record George and let me listen to it, and then do my vocal after we get his on tape.' Tammy was a very quick study." ...|$|E
