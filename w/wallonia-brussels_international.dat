40|$|Understanding the {{mechanism}} of resistance of genes to reactivation will help improve the success of nuclear reprogramming. Using mouse embryonic fibroblast nuclei with normal or reduced DNA methylation in combination with chromatin modifiers able to erase H 3 K 9 me 3, H 3 K 27 me 3, and H 2 AK 119 ub 1 from transplanted nuclei, we reveal the basis for resistance of genes to transcriptional reprogramming by oocyte factors. A majority of genes is affected {{by more than one}} type of treatment, suggesting that resistance can require repression through multiple epigenetic mechanisms. We classify resistant genes according to their sensitivity to 11 chromatin modifier combinations, revealing the existence of synergistic as well as adverse effects of chromatin modifiers on removal of resistance. We further demonstrate that the chromatin modifier USP 21 reduces resistance through its H 2 AK 119 deubiquitylation activity. Finally, we provide evidence that H 2 A ubiquitylation also contributes to resistance to transcriptional reprogramming in mouse nuclear transfer embryos.
