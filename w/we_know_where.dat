500|$|During the sixties, Kraft was a {{household}} name in America. He appeared {{on the cover of}} the August 27, 1965 issue of Time Magazine, in which he was profiled as the [...] "Conductor in a Command Post". In his interview with Time, Kraft compared himself with namesake Christopher Columbus, displaying what the magazine described as [...] "an almost angry pride" [...] in his work. [...] "We know a lot more about what we have to do than he did," [...] Kraft said. [...] "And <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we're going." [...] The article described Kraft's role in the Gemini 5 mission, and drew on Kraft's frequent comparisons of his position as flight director with that of an orchestra conductor.|$|E
500|$|On March 12, 2015, Disney officially {{announced}} that a feature-length sequel to Frozen was in development with Buck and Lee returning as directors, and Del Vecho returning as producer. In a May 2015 interview, Buck said, [...] "We have lots of things to figure out but at least <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we are going." [...] In March 2016, Bell stated that voice recording for the film was due to start later in the month, but in September of that same year, she retracted her earlier comments as mistaken and explained {{that she had been}} working instead on other Frozen projects such as the upcoming holiday special. In April 2017, Disney {{announced that}} the sequel would be released on November 27, 2019.|$|E
500|$|Three {{untitled}} {{films are}} set for release on May 1, August 7, and November 6, 2020. The August 7 film was previously scheduled for July 10, 2020. In October 2016, Feige {{said it was}} a combination of knowing what films would occupy these dates and allowing some flexibility, saying, [...] "We know what [...] we’d like them to be for 2020. Over the years, where we’re aiming we’ve been lucky enough that it’s usually been the same thing but we always leave ourselves the opportunity to bob and weave and adapt if we have to. But <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we’re headed for 2020 and we have ideas and we're beginning to solidify the years beyond that." [...] Feige and Marvel have ideas for films through 2021, and additional storylines planned through 2028.|$|E

500|$|However, Scott instead {{contacted}} Lindelof {{and asked}} him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the Alien films, such as the Alien creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to Alien, the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, [...] "If the ending to [...] is just going to be the room that John Hurt walks into that's full of [...] eggs , there's nothing interesting in that, because <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end." [...] "A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Finnish {{journalist}} also travelled to Karamakhi in mid-August 1999, {{where he}} interviewed some villagers and their military Commander General Dzherollak. The journalist wrote: [...] "The Wahhabists' trucks go all over Russia. Even one wrong move in Moscow or Makhachkala, they warn, {{will lead to}} bombs and bloodshed everywhere." [...] According to the journalist the Wahhabis had told him, [...] "if they start bombing us, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> our bombs will explode." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even 1968's [...] "Aerial View No. 1", {{despite the}} spatial {{hint of the}} title, is far from literal. Certain {{features}} of structure and color render a literal interpretation of this image as an aerial landscape difficult or even impossible. The attempt at interpretation is both invited and repulsed. But by about 1970, with the [...] "Night Landings" [...] paintings, there was a definite shift away from the previous decade's stubbornly refractive attitude. The [...] "Night Landings" [...] offer a much more definite sense of scale and viewpoint, especially {{with the aid of}} the titles. [...] "Night Landings: Nairobi" [...] is not disorienting in the least: <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we are; we know we're in a plane, we know the plane is landing, and we even know roughly what time it is: we are looking down, and we see vividly the city named in the title, with the surrounding land and water.|$|E

2500|$|In part {{these changes}} were an {{increased}} awareness of how important news media were to Labour's election campaign. [...] One party press secretary said, of Labour's attitude {{to the news media}} in the 1983 general election campaign, that [...] "If a miracle had happened and Fleet Street had suddenly come clamouring to Walworth Road for pro-Labour material, they would have been sent away with a copy of the manifesto each." [...] The party leadership noted afterwards that it had been the effect of the [...] "Loony Left" [...] image that had caused it to lose the 1987 Greenwich by-election by such a large margin. [...] This is not to say, of course, that Labour ignored the press. [...] However, it became reluctant to talk to it. [...] Kinnock refused to talk to the press on the flight back from his visit to the US President Ronald Reagan after British journalists had continually sought a story that would represent the trip in a negative light. [...] Similarly, Patricia Hewitt, then party press secretary, considered abandoning holding daily press conferences {{in the run-up to the}} 1987 general election, because [...] "they allow the newspaper journalists to set the agenda [...] and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they stand".|$|E
