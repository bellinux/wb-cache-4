500|$|For Wasting Light, Grohl {{stated that}} they {{would go back to}} a rawer and heavier sound after [...] "exploring new musical ground" [...] on the {{previous}} records, adding that [...] "with the last album <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> concerned with being musical, now it's time for us to be a rock band again". To contrast with the [...] "seven or eight minute-long songs, with seven or eight sections, and two or three time changes" [...] Grohl played with Them Crooked Vultures, he instead tried to compose the [...] "tightest, catchiest four-and-a-half-minute 'softball bat to your face' songs". Hawkins added that he liked Wasting Light for being [...] "straightforward, and that’s a good thing for us right now. The last couple [...] had some big dynamic changes." [...] Grohl described the effort as their heaviest yet, later saying it was done because [...] "I'm 42 now. I don't know if I'm {{going to be able to}} make this record when I'm 46 or 49. It's my last chance." [...] While the demos that prompted Grohl to say the album would be their heaviest yet were not used on the album, Vig took the declarations to heart, following three criteria while recording: [...] "It's got to be hooky, heavy, and we're going analog all the way." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{spent five}} months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and {{recording}} {{what would become}} Never Say Die!. [...] "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. [...] "We were getting really drugged out, {{doing a lot of}} dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E
2500|$|We {{could have}} done it if we'd kept punching, but the band {{actually}} disintegrated, basically, looking back, because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> tired. We should have just taken a year off. But what happened was we were right {{at the end of the}} period when, in order to flog a record in the States, you were virtually out promoting the one you had out the year before. So it was a totally asynchronous situation. We were having to dig into what we viewed as archives when we went out of the country. So we were having to promote Screaming Targets when we already had Hats Off Step Lively out here. It was at a time of the most intense development of original material in the band's life so the result was extremely disruptive. – Camilleri ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, Osbourne {{left the}} band {{for three months}} to pursue {{interest}} in a solo project he called Blizzard of Ozz, a name which had been suggested by his father. Three members of the band Necromandus, who had supported Black Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called Earth, did backup for Osbourne {{in the studio and}} briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band. At the request of the other members, Osbourne rejoined Sabbath.

2500|$|According to road manager Don Opperman: [...] "The way I {{remember}} it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' {{were mixed}} together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [...] just handed me his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, {{and that was the end}} of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow. It sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!" [...] The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Weston {{was born}} in Alpena, Michigan to Frank and Jane Weston [...] He was raised in Sault Ste. Marie, and was a star player on Sault Ste. Marie High School's 1913 state {{championship}} football team. The Sault Ste. Marie “Blue Devils” were a football powerhouse with Weston. In a 1972 interview with his home town newspaper, Weston recalled the 1913 championship team: “We were an awful bunch of roughnecks – there was no football team in the state tougher than we were that year. We blasted all of them and loved doing it.” Weston was asked about a 1913 newspaper report {{that he had been}} tackled by an irate woman during a 24-7 win over Alpena. He recalled the incident:”The game was played there, and the fans hated us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> rough to suit them. I was running around the left end toward the Alpena side of the field. There was nobody near me as I ran the end, and all of a sudden, this woman dives from the sideline and drops me for no gain. Well, I was so surprised I couldn’t get up at first.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{show has}} been {{described}} as cartoonish and likened to Tom and Jerry. [...] Dean P. of the Courier-Mail described the violence in the show as [...] "hypocritical" [...] and that [...] "the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored. [...] After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects." [...] Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A-Team used [...] "antineutron bullets—they destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being". [...] According to certain estimates, an episode of the A-Team held up to 46 violent acts. Stephen J. Cannell, co-creator of the show responds: [...] "They were determined to make a point, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue." [...] Originally, The A-Team's status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as The Cosby Show, Who's the Boss? and Growing Pains. [...] John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote in a 1986 article that [...] "...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety".|$|E
2500|$|One {{persistent}} account about Camille {{states that}} 23 people held a [...] "hurricane party" [...] {{on the third}} floor of the Richelieu Manor Apartments in Pass Christian, Mississippi, in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall. The high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building, killing all but one person. Who the survivor is, how many party guests there were, and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling. An ABC made-for-TV movie called Hurricane, starring Frank Sutton of Gomer Pyle USMC, Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Will Geer, Martin Milner, and Michael Learned, was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party. However, the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie, as was the name of the hurricane. The television show Quantum Leap carried an episode regarding the parties of Hurricane Camille and the actual hurricane itself. Twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the Richelieu Apartments during the hurricane, eight of whom died. The tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach. Survivor Ben Duckworth has expressed irritation at the story. There was no hurricane party. Duckworth reiterated in 2001. We were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> tired to party. I can’t tell you why that story persists, or why people didn't put two and two together. I guess the hurricane party makes a good story.|$|E
