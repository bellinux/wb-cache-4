2500|$|In July 1999 at {{the height}} of Emin's Turner Prize fame, she created a number of monoprint {{drawings}} inspired by the public and private life of Princess Diana for a themed exhibition called Temple of Diana held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as They Wanted You To Be Destroyed (1999) related to Princess Diana's bulimia eating disorder, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as Love <b>Was</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Side and a description of Princess Diana's dress with puffy sleeves. Other drawings highlighted The things you did to help other people written next to a drawing by Emin of Diana, Princess of Wales in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase [...] "It makes perfect sence to know they killed you" [...] (with Emin's trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they [...] "could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings" [...] and [...] "It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They're quite sentimental I think and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever." ...|$|E

I embraced you when you left--that I might feel if you had the cigar case or any other articles hidden on your body.
