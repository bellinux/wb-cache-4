5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} {{the size of}} a number of foreign gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions. DeSaussure is believed to have struck half eagles first for that reason, after consultation with bank officials. The eagle lacked such equivalents, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.|$|E
5|$|In casting, Nancy Cartwright {{originally}} planned {{to audition for}} the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role.|$|E

5|$|Stanier, the {{designer}} of the locomotives, felt that the added weight and difficulty in maintenance due to the streamlining <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> {{a price to pay}} for the actual benefits gained at high speed. Therefore, in 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an average cost of £10,659 each.|$|E
5|$|The quark–gluon plasma {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10−6 seconds after the Big Bang (the quark epoch), the universe was filled with quark–gluon plasma, as the temperature <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> for hadrons to be stable.|$|E
5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high.</b> At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E

5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high,</b> however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 2008, {{construction}} {{began on}} the reconstruction of Interchange 17, with completion on June 18, 2010. As a result of reconstructing this interchange, the SJTA approved raising the interchange toll to $3.00. This new rate is charged to motorists heading to or from the east along the Atlantic City Expressway at Route 50. The proposal drew opposition from area officials who felt the proposed rate <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high.</b> The westbound exit and eastbound entrance at Interchange 17 {{was designed to be}} E-ZPass only, the first such interchange on the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} in 1901 proposed a scheme {{similar to that}} of the Glen Grey Act, imposing a tax of £2 to induce natives to work. In 1903, Rhodesian capitalists even proposed a £4 tax but Chamberlain preferred the lower rate of £2 and sought Clarke's opinion on its potential to cause trouble. Clarke argued that even £2 <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high.</b> Milner disagreed and wrote to Sir William Milton, the company administrator, saying: 'I am embarrassed by a report form the Resident Commissioner in which he utterly condemns the proposed Native Tax Ordinance'. In 1904, finally, Alfred Lyttelton, Chamberlain's successor refused assent, citing Clarke's reports and an ordinance limited the tax to £1.|$|E

Wages may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> to be feasible.|$|E
5|$|Chile {{began to}} seek {{additional}} ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered {{many of its}} surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race. Chile asked for Canada and Eagle, the two battleships they ordered before the war, {{but the cost of}} converting the latter back to a battleship <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high.</b> Planned replacements included the two remaining s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile itself over the value of such ships. In the end, Chile only bought Canada and four destroyers in April 1920—all ships that had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914 but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War—for relatively low prices. Canada, for instance, was sold for just £1,000,000, less than half of what had been required to construct the ship.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{considered}} options {{to replace the}} aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne {{was too small to}} operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged that the cost of a new aircraft carrier <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high,</b> especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed-wing aircraft in 1963.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt {{that the risk of}} damage to the book <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high.</b> By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E
5|$|Planetesimals {{within the}} region which would become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high,</b> the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E
5|$|The running air battles {{had cost}} the Ju 87 units heavily. The lack of {{protection}} for I./StG 77 had cost it 10 Ju 87s with one damaged beyond repair. Total manpower losses for the unit amounted to 17 killed or mortally wounded, six wounded and five captured out of 56 men. II./StG 77 lost three Ju 87s to fighter attack and one damaged beyond repair, five crewmen dead and one captured. III./StG 77 also lost two Ju 87s and two damaged with four men killed. StG 77s casualties amounted to 26 killed, six taken prisoner, and six wounded. The battles brought {{the number of}} Ju 87s lost thus far in the campaign to 59 with a further 33 damaged. The price <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> and {{with the exception of}} sporadic attacks on convoys later in the year, the Ju 87 played no further part in the Battle of Britain. Among the dead was Gruppenkommandeur Hauptmann Herbert Meisel.|$|E

5|$|She {{was born}} in Paris and moved with her family to Washington, D.C., in 1966. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her voice. She became a {{professional}} actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing. She made her film debut in 1985's Heaven Help Us, followed by roles in The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive. She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and received a recurring role in the television series Brothers. In 1987, she auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about the Simpson family on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith intended to audition for the role of Bart Simpson, but the casting director felt her voice <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high,</b> so she was assigned the role of Lisa, instead. She voiced Lisa for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half-hour show, The Simpsons. For her work as the character, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the French opened fire Goliath, {{ignoring}} fire from the fort to starboard and from Guerrier to port, most of which <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> to trouble the ship, crossed {{the head of the}} French line. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap. As the bow of Guerrier came within range, Goliath opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of Guerrier. Foley's Royal Marines and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed Guerrier entirely. Goliath eventually stopped close to the bow of Conquérant, opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate Sérieuse and bomb vessel Hercule, which were anchored inshore of the battle line.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
