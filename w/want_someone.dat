500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have {{to stay home and}} mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who were thought to be easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E

Jackman noted how Wolverine driving the plot {{in spite of}} his gruff personality made for interesting story choices, as [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> to go back to take someone’s head off, fantastic, but he’s really got to go back and almost act in parts as inspiration, as mentor, as guide, because he can’t do it all on his own, which is always his preferred method".|$|E
500|$|Casting {{the lead}} role of Barris was a long, {{difficult}} process. [...] "After two months of screen tests and everything I still wasn't able to get Sam Rockwell," [...] Clooney reflected. Rockwell had always been Clooney's first choice ever since they worked together on Welcome to Collinwood (2002). Both Clooney and Barris also believed Rockwell shared an uncanny resemblance to Barris. [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> too famous to play the role," [...] the director reasoned. [...] "In my opinion, you cannot have famous people playing famous people. It doesn't work. Sam was the guy for the part, ready to break and hadn't yet." ...|$|E

Christenson highlighted that Ranieri's good humour would be the antithesis to the short-tempered outbursts of his predecessor Nigel Pearson, concluding, [...] "If Leicester <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> nice, they’ve got him.

500|$|Madonna was {{inspired}} by the look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was released as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European countries and Japan. [...] "I Know It", a track from Madonna's self-titled debut album, appeared as the B-side. In 1989, the song was used as the B-side for the [...] "Express Yourself" [...] single release.|$|E

500|$|He {{appeared}} as the Genie in the Aladdin sequel The Return of Jafar {{and on the}} 1994 Aladdin television series. The Genie had been voiced by Robin Williams in Aladdin, and Castellaneta described replacing him as [...] "sort of like stepping into Hamlet after Laurence Olivier did it, how can you win?" [...] He also provided Genie's voice in the Kingdom Hearts video game series for both Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II (with archived audio used for [...] and its remake {{as well as for}} the later HD collections HD 1.5 Remix and HD 2.5 Remix). Castellaneta portrayed Aaron Spelling in the 2004 NBC film Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie's Angels, which followed the true story of how Spelling created the show. Other films in which Castellaneta has appeared include Nothing in Common, Say Anything..., Super Mario Bros., The Client, Space Jam, My Giant, The Simpsons Movie, , , , The Cat in the Hat and The Pursuit of Happyness. In 2000, he won an Annie Award for his portrayal of the Postman in the animated Christmas television special Olive, the Other Reindeer. In 2006, he appeared in Jeff Garlin's independent film I <b>Want</b> <b>Someone</b> to Eat Cheese With along with several other Second City alumni.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Garlin {{claims that}} I <b>Want</b> <b>Someone</b> to Eat Cheese With {{was the first}} Hollywood movie to {{incorporate}} Millennium Park. [...] The film was not released until 2006, {{after the release of}} several other movies. These include the 2005 film The Weather Man, which starred Nicolas Cage and was filmed in part at the park's McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The 2006 romantic comedy The Break-Up shot scenes in the park, then had to reshoot some of them because Cloud Gate was under cover in some of the initial shots. Other movies which include scenes filmed in Millennium Park include the 2005 thriller Derailed, the 2006 romance The Lake House, and the 2007 thriller Butterfly on a Wheel. [...] At least two television series have filmed in the park, including Leverage and Prison Break, which featured shots of the Crown Fountain in the first few episodes of its first season (2005). In the ending scene of Source Code (2011), Jake Gyllenhaal's and Michelle Monaghan's characters are seen walking through Millennium Park, and {{make their way to the}} Cloud Gate. In the 2012 romantic comedy, The Vow, the characters run from the Art Institute of Chicago across the Nichols Bridgeway to Millennium Park, where they kiss under Cloud Gate.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{for the cover}} premiered on Oprah.com on February 28 at midnight, followed by an exclusive interview. It was directed by Peter Zavadil. After her first performance of the song on Unplugged on the Country Music Television, McEntire also performed the song at the Country Music Association (CMA) awards on November 10, 2010. Mawuse Ziegbe of MTV News praised her cover, writing, [...] "Singing with no band onstage, donning a glittery black dress with her signature red hair flowing to her shoulders, the legendary vocalist's performance scored a standing ovation." [...] Jillian Mapes and Megan Vick of Billboard praised the performance, writing, [...] "As if Beyonce's 2008 ballad 'If I Were a Boy' wasn't moving enough, country queen Reba McEntire's smokey twang and solemn stance turned the song on its head." [...] They {{also noted that the}} simple and powerful performance [...] "is enough to inspire tears, or at least goosebumps." [...] Country Music Television's Chet Flippo felt that McEntire's performance was [...] "the musical highlight of the evening" [...] and added that it was [...] "a lesson of what country music should be striving for these days". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave a mixed review of her performance, writing that [...] " [...] did something unexpected, softening her delivery and finding the creases in the song, as if Beyoncé were whispering to her from the wings." [...] However, Entertainment Weeklys Mandi Bierly wrote that the lyrics were [...] "just too young for , {{and when it comes to}} the chorus, I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> to belt it".|$|E

500|$|The {{death in}} 1695 of Sir William Phips vacated the {{governorship}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. [...] Colonial agents lobbied to select either Wait Winthrop or Joseph Dudley, both native sons, to replace Phips, but the king, <b>wanting</b> <b>someone</b> who would better represent crown authority, selected Bellomont. Since William <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> who could exert authority over more of New England, {{he was also}} given the governorships of New Hampshire, and New York. The major concern that Bellomont was instructed to address was ongoing problems with piracy, including the open commerce with pirates {{that went on in}} New York City and Rhode Island.|$|R
500|$|The {{first few}} races of the 1982 season were promising. Villeneuve led in Brazil {{in the new}} 126C2, before {{spinning}} into retirement, and finished third at the United States Grand Prix West although he was later disqualified for a technical infringement. The Ferraris were handed an unexpected advantage at the San Marino Grand Prix as an escalation of the FISA-FOCA war saw the FOCA teams boycott the race, effectively leaving Renault as Ferrari's only serious opposition. With Renault driver Prost retiring from fourth place on lap 7 followed by his teammate Arnoux on the 44th lap Ferrari {{seemed to have the}} win guaranteed. In order to conserve fuel and ensure the cars finished the Ferrari team ordered both drivers to slow down. Villeneuve believed that the order also meant that the drivers were to maintain position but Pironi passed Villeneuve. A few laps later Villeneuve re-passed Pironi and slowed down again, believing that Pironi was simply trying to entertain the Italian crowd. On the last lap Pironi passed and aggressively chopped across the front of Gilles in Villeneuve corner and took the win. Villeneuve was irate as he believed that Pironi had disobeyed the order to hold position. Meanwhile, Pironi claimed that he had done nothing wrong as the team had only ordered the cars to slow down, not maintain position. Villeneuve stated after the race [...] "I think {{it is well known that}} if I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> to stay behind me and I am faster, then he stays behind me." [...] Feeling betrayed and angry Villeneuve vowed never to speak to Pironi again.|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
