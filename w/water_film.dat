25|$|Snowflakes have a {{wide range}} of shapes, even as they fall; among these are: six-sided star-like dendrites, {{hexagonal}} needles, platelets and icy pellets. Once snow accumulates on the ground, the flakes immediately begin to undergo transformation (called metamorphosis), owing to temperature changes, sublimation, and mechanical action. Temperature changes may be from the ambient temperature, solar radiation, rainwater, wind, or the temperature of the material beneath the snow layer. Mechanical action includes wind and compaction. Over time, bulk snow tends to consolidate—its crystals become truncated from breaking apart or losing mass with sublimation directly from solid to gas and with freeze-thaw, causing them to combine as coarse and granular ice crystals. Colbeck reports that fresh, cold, and man-made snow all interact more directly with the base of a ski and increase friction, indicating the use of harder waxes. Conversely, older, warmer, and denser snows present lower friction, in part due to increased grain size, which better promotes a <b>water</b> <b>film</b> and a smoother surface of the snow crystals for which softer waxes are indicated.|$|E
500|$|Frogs have no tail, {{except as}} larvae, {{and most have}} long hind legs, {{elongated}} ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have short vertebral columns, {{with no more than}} 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx). Like other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins. The ribs are poorly developed, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and [...] a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them. For the skin to serve as a respiratory organ, it must remain moist. This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment, some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> and be passed into their bloodstream. This {{may be one of the}} causes of the worldwide decline in frog populations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lower part}} of the trap {{contains}} glands which absorb nutrients from captured prey. Along the upper inside part of the trap is a slick, waxy coating which makes the escape of its prey nearly impossible. Surrounding the entrance to the trap is a structure called the peristome (the [...] "lip") which is slippery and often quite colorful, attracting prey, but offering an unsure footing. [...] The prey-capture effectiveness of the peristome is further enhanced in moist environments, where condensation may cause a thin <b>water</b> <b>film</b> to form {{on the surface of the}} peristome. [...] When wet, the slippery surface of the peristome causes insects to ‘aquaplane’, or slip and fall, into the pitcher. [...] Above the peristome is a lid (the operculum); in many species, this keeps rain from diluting the fluid within the pitcher, the underside of which may contain nectar glands which attract prey.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{a sliding}} ski melts a thin and {{transitory}} film of lubricating layer of water, {{caused by the}} heat of friction between the ski and the snow in its passing. Colbeck suggests that the optimum <b>water</b> <b>film</b> thickness is in the range between 4 [...] and 12 μm. However, the heat generated by friction can be lost by conduction to a cold ski, thereby diminishing {{the production of the}} melt layer. At the other extreme, when the snow is wet and warm, heat generation creates a thicker film that can create increased capillary drag on the ski bottom. Kuzmin and Fuss suggest that the most favorable combination of ski base material properties to minimize ski sliding friction on snow include: increased hardness and lowered thermal conductivity of the base material to promote meltwater generation for lubrication, wear resistance in cold snow, and hydrophobicity to minimize capillary suction. These attributes are readily achievable with a PFTE base, which diminishes the value added by glide waxes. Lintzén reports that factors other than wax are much more important in reducing friction on cross-country skate skis—the curvature of the ski and snow conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has a broad {{geographical}} distribution. It {{has been}} isolated from many areas {{across the world}} including Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Antarctica where it is known from {{a broad spectrum of}} substrates. It is principally characterized as a phyllosphere fungus and is commonly found in areas of decaying organic material such as leaves and grains as well as ripening grapes. Isolates of this species however have been recovered from freshwater, marine water and clinical specimens. [...] It has also been isolated from agricultural areas and indoor built environments. In agricultural environments, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor can pose a respiratory hazard for agricultural workers. Agricultural workers are subject to increased exposure when they partake in activities involving the handling of grains. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has additionally been isolated from straw in hay barns or hay lofts. Workers in these settings should consider the proper use of masks to avoid infection. If individuals show atopic symptoms, a change in occupation might be considered. In indoor environments, S.salmonicolor has been associated with severe water and mould damage. Flooded basements and utility rooms are places where S.salmonicolor may be recovered. This fungus will also commonly associate with standing water films, although not very much has been documented on this. It can form a pink <b>water</b> <b>film</b> around stagnant toilet water. The most efficient way to avoid exposure in the home is to eliminate moisture sources and keep bathrooms clean, dry and ventilated.|$|E
