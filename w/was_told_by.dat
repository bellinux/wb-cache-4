50|$|A story {{written in}} the first person can <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> the main character, a less {{important}} character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.|$|R

5|$|I <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> my {{publishers}} that Cher {{heard my}} version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual. But the original writers were happy {{for me to}} do that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval about what happened to the song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for crews' wages {{to be stopped}} when a ship was sunk. Famed Labour leader James Larkin {{raised the issue of}} the survivors' treatment in the Dáil Éireann.

Mulder, meanwhile, sits in a church, crying as he looks {{at a picture of}} his sister.|$|E
5|$|The film {{created a}} greater {{awareness}} of the franchise and drew in many new fans. Transformers box office success led to the active development of films based on Voltron and Robotech, {{as well as a}} Knight Rider remake. When filming the sequel, Bay <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> soldiers the film helped their children understand what their work was like, and that many had christened their Buffalos – the vehicle used for Bonecrusher – after various Transformer characters.|$|E
5|$|The storyline in Dark Forces follows Kyle Katarn (voiced by Nick Jameson), a Human {{mercenary}} {{employed by}} the Rebel Alliance. Before the game begins, Katarn was a student learning the skills required to follow in his father's career of agricultural mechanics.

5|$|After {{developing}} Gunstar Heroes, Treasure {{was divided}} into four teams to work on four separate projects: Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, , and Dynamite Headdy. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, served as head programmer on Dynamite Headdy. After deciding to publish a localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> Sega of America to make the game more difficult. This was because Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as difficult. In addition to changes in difficulty, most of the dialogue in the game was removed, {{and several of the}} character and boss sprites were changed.|$|E
5|$|As a harpsichordist, Pinnock toured Europe {{with the}} Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While {{a student at}} the RCM, he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> the registrar, John Stainer, that it would be {{impossible}} to make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E

5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster {{acquired}} Success, Lehman was {{in position to}} not only adapt his own novellette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks {{to make it more}} cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman’s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|Citizens {{reported}} to Virgil on the Cowboys' movements and their threats {{told him that}} Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance. Virgil Earp <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to disarm the Cowboys. His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboy's repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday's room in Fly's boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} with his career. In March 1938 {{he was called}} to readiness with 604 Squadron during the Munich crisis. At this time the squadron was flying the Hawker Demon. He was displeased when they converted to the Bristol Blenheim. The machines were fitted with a tray of four 303 Browning machine guns to give forward-facing firepower. As a long-range fighter it was of dubious value. The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 could, and would, expose the frailties of the aircraft which was originally intended as a bomber. However, Cunningham <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> the Air Ministry {{that it would be}} sufficient in the night fighter role, which is where they intended to use this variant. On 20 April 1938, John returned to de Havilland test-flying de Havilland Moth Minors.|$|E
5|$|Dahl <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> radio {{executives}} that he'd {{never make}} it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E
