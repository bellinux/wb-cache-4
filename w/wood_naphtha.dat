25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, <b>wood</b> <b>naphtha</b> or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive windshield washer fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
50|$|Completely {{denatured}} alcohol {{must be made}} {{in accordance with the}} following formulation: with every 90 parts by volume of alcohol mix 9.5 parts by volume of <b>wood</b> <b>naphtha</b> or a substituteand 0.5 parts by volume of crude pyridine, and to the resulting mixture add mineral naphtha (petroleum oil) in the proportion of 3.75 litres to every 1000 litres of the mixture and synthetic organic dyestuff (methyl violet) in the proportion of 1.5 grams to every 1000 litres of the mixture.|$|E
