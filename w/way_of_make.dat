40|$|Nowadays, it {{very common}} {{to use the}} prefix Neuro in {{connection}} with topics so different as Economics or Arts. Neuroscience or Psychobiology are disciplines with a little representation in the academic formation of the Education professionals. In this work {{we have tried to}} document why these professionals need to receive a psychobiological formation, which help them to understand the biological mechanisms responsible of the behaviors that are the aim of the educational process. This process may be understood as a pool of intentional learning, which will modified the behavior of people in accordance with a specific social pattern. To change behavior is to change the subjacent biological mechanisms, like the neuronal circuits responsible of the mentioned behavior. Then, it could be necessary that, the professional of Education have a basic knowledge of the mechanisms that he wants to modify and the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>make</b> it efficiently. This is why the professional of the Education has to extend his psychobiological formation and {{to face up to the}} challenge that the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) involves...|$|E
40|$|The {{emotional}} part of {{a museum}} experience is being debated and there is research pointing towards the affective part of learning. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine how museum pedagogues reason about the usage of affective learning in their work and to investigate whether they consider affective pedagogy is a part of their work or not. Furthermore how they consider themselves working, or not working, with feelings in their pedagogy. A key factor in this study has been to work interdisciplinary with both museum pedagogy and social science with theoretical perspectives of feelings such as happiness, sadness, anger, disgust and fear, and with theories such as Feelings & materiality and Pedagogy of Feeling. Methodologically a qualitative interview study museum pedagogues have been used together with observation of four Swedish state- and country museums. In this thesis it is shown that the interviewed museum pedagogues indeed have acknowledged the fact that the museum is an affective place, but the interviewed had different <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>make</b> use of feelings. They all agree on the fact that feelings can support the learning process, and that all the different feelings have their own effect on learning. Also that the museum pedagogues have some influence on the feeling that the exhibitions are to emit, which could be used in the pedagogues favor if the exhibition consists of hard and problematic feelings. However, in contrast to this it seems that few of the museum pedagogues discuss the affective influence of a upcoming exhibition or program, or evaluate a project in what feeling the visitors experienced during the visit. This is a two years master’s thesis in Archive, Library and Museum studies...|$|E

For Anderson and Markides (2006) strategic innovation is about discovering a new WHO, a new WHAT and a new HOW. An enabler of strategic innovation has been the development and diffusion of information and communication technologies. In this paper, ten selected case studies of innovative services and business models supported in electronic platforms are presented and discussed.

These business models were analyzed through the business model canvas framework {{and in terms of}} strategic innovation.
