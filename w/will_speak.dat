25|$|Strangely, he {{has become}} more and more akin to HYV of the seeds he sells. Like them, he is capable of high-yielding {{varieties}} of phrase and word. At a Gandhi seminar, he <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> of the relevance of Gandhi. At a meeting in Madras on the necessity of combine harvesters. At another meeting on appropriate technology, he will plump for organic manures. At a talk in London, he <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> on the necessity of chemical fertilizers. He will label slum dwellers ‘ecological refugees’, and advertise his career as a quest for ‘imparting an ecological basis to productivity improvement.’ This, after presiding over, and indiscriminately furthering, one of the ecologically most devastating technologies of modern times – the HYV package of the Green revolution.|$|E
25|$|Cassie Logan: The {{narrator and}} protagonist. Cassie is 9 years old. She has a fiery temper, is brave, {{and is also}} very naive about racism, but {{sometimes}} she can be just like the boys.

25|$|In {{the course}} of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to judge him by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (cf. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates says he will not use sophistic {{language}} — carefully arranged ornate words and phrases — but <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> using the common idiom of the Greek language. He affirms that he <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> in the manner he is heard using in the agora and at the money tables. Despite his claim of ignorance, Socrates speaks masterfully, correcting the Orators and showing them what they should have done — speak the truth persuasively and with wisdom. Although offered the opportunity to appease the prejudices of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. Accordingly, the jury condemns Socrates to death.|$|E
25|$|Forrest {{reportedly}} {{died from}} acute complications of diabetes at the Memphis {{home of his}} brother Jesse on October 29, 1877. His eulogy was delivered by his recent spiritual mentor and former Confederate chaplain, George Tucker Stainback, who declared in his eulogy: Lieutenant-General Nathan Bedford Forrest, though dead, yet speaketh. His acts have photographed themselves upon the hearts of thousands, and <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> there forever.|$|E

The angel tells Mary that Jesus <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> in infancy, and when mature, will be a companion to the most righteous. Mary, responding how she could conceive and have a child when no man had touched her, {{was told by the}} angel that God can decree what He wills, and it shall come to pass.|$|E

There will be several leading gentlemen present who <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> on the occasion, amongst whom will be John O'C. Power, Esq., M.P., John Ferguson, Esq. Glasgow, and J.J.Louden, Esq.

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>speak,</b> and you will listen. Then I <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Robert Christgau found the Wu-Tang Clan [...] "grander" [...] and [...] "goofier" [...] than their West Coast contemporaries and concluded, [...] "Expect the masterwork this album's reputation suggests and you'll probably be disappointed—it <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> directly only to indigenous hip hoppers. Expect a glorious human mess, {{as opposed to}} the ominous platinum product of their opposite numbers, and you'll realize the dope game isn't everyone's dead-end street". In 2010, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> about something that had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence {{is probably one of the}} most powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. Here is a man who <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All {{you have to do is}} listen." ...|$|E
500|$|In his introduction, Townsend {{describes}} {{the book as}} [...] "an honest attempt to present the facts as they are, however unpleasant" [...] and a counterbalance to the [...] "maudlin sentiment" [...] and [...] "misinformation" [...] of other writers on China who have made [...] "fatuous attempts to sprinkle bright hopes over dark facts." [...] He argues that existing literature available in the West is skewed in favor of China because of the demands for [...] "political correctness" [...] {{on the part of}} publishers and the vested interests of the three major categories of foreigners in China, the missionaries, businesspeople and government officials. He notes that while China's virtues <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> for themselves, [...] "in appraising a stranger with whom we are to deal, {{it is important to know}} his shortcomings".|$|E
