The {{purpose of the study}} will be to determine if public and private organizations <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by internal organizational factors or external organizational factors. Using Roger’s diffusion theory, Mohr’s internal determinants and Berry and Berry’s unified theory as a foundation, this research will endeavor to prove hypotheses which suggest that private organizations <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by internal organizational factors and public organizations <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by external organizational factors although not exclusively. The research method for this study will involve a mixed methods approach. A survey of innovation champions will be implemented online followed by a qualitative interview of a subset of those respondents. In addition to the research specific to internal and external organizational factors, this study will also seek to assess the importance of the use of innovation champions during the social innovation process. Social innovation is a new concept in the realm of innovation. This research will offer much needed insight into a process that is new and evolving...|$|R

Third, voter abstention is higher among those who believe that the economy <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by the EU than by the national government.

40|$|Structure Matters in Negotiation 2 We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} framework and associated propositions for interpreting {{a key component of}} negotiation dynamics – offer exchange. We view negotiation as collaborative search of a complex offer space, whereby negotiators simplify and coordinate search via information contained in offer exchanges, isolating sub-regions of the offer space for potential solutions. We suggest that early search <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by value of offers to the negotiators, but later <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by structure of offers in the exchange, whereby {{there appears to be a}} heuristic for selecting offers that are structurally similar to prior offers.

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} how needs assessment findings and methodologies are accepted by public decision makers in the U. S. Virgin Islands. To accomplish this, the following five different needs assessments were executed: (1) population survey; (2) key informants survey; (3) community forum; (4) rates-under-treatment (RUT); and (5) social indicators analysis. The assessments measured unmet needs of older persons regarding transportation, in-home care, and socio-recreation services, and determined which of the five methodologies is most costly, time consuming, and valid. ^ The results of a five-way comparative analysis was presented to public sector decision makers who were surveyed to determine whether they <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by needs assessment findings, or by the methodology used, and to ascertain the factors that lead to their acceptance of needs assessment findings and methodologies. ^ The survey results revealed that acceptance of findings and methodology <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> by the congruency of the findings with decision makers 2 ̆ 7 goals and objectives, feasibility of the findings, and credibility of the researcher. ^ The study also found that decision makers <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> equally by needs assessment findings and methodology; that they prefer population surveys, although they are the most expensive and time consuming of the methodologies; that different types of needs assessments produce different results; and, that needs assessment is an essential program planning tool. Executive decision makers are found to <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by management factors than by legal and political factors, while legislative decision makers <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by legal factors. Decision makers overwhelmingly view their leadership style as democratic. ^ A typology of the five needs assessments, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, is offered as a planning guide for public decision makers. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} unify and extend several lines of recent {{scholarship}} through {{a study of}} the 2001 British election. In doing so, it proposes and tests four hypotheses. First, preferences over British adoption of the Euro influence voting behavior, as predicted by the EU issue voting hypothesis. Second, economic voting is weaker among those who believe the national economy to <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by Europe than by the British government. Third, abstention is higher among those who believe that the economy <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by the EU than by the British government. Finally, those who see the EU having <b>more</b> <b>influence</b> over the British economy are more likely to vote on the basis of social policy. Analyses of data from the 2001 British Election Study find strong support for the first hypothesis, no support for the second, support for the third, and mixed evidence for the fourth. Taken together, these findings add to the evidence that economic integration influence domestic electoral politics in several important ways. ...|$|R

We followed {{the definition of the}} soft and hard rock sites of their study. The estimated shear wave velocity of hard rock sites is greater than 600  m/s, while that of soft rock sites is less than 600  m/s. Among the 15 stations, there are four stations (IBRH 14, MYGH 04, TCGH 17 and YMTH 03) are located at hard rock sites. However, in this study, it did not show that stations at soft rock sites <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by rainfall than stations at hard rock sites. Moreover, the relative velocity change caused by high-intensity rainfall of TCGH 17 station is much higher than that of 12 stations at soft rock sites (Fig.  4). One possible interpretation is that the relative velocity change (dv/v) highly depends on the borehole depth (Takagi and Okada 2012).

40|$|The {{breastfeeding}} rate in Hong Kong is low {{compared to}} the rates in Western countries. To understand {{the relative importance of}} different sources of influence on infant feeding practices, 714 Chinese mothers with infants aged 4 weeks to 6 months were studied. It was found that the bottlefeeding mothers <b>were</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by the medical professionals who did not support breastfeeding. This <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> further reinforced by the mass media and particularly television advertisements on infant formulae. The successful breastfeeding mothers, on the other hand, <b>were</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>more</b> by their social networks through which they were told of the dangers of bottlefeeding. The failed breastfeeding mothers differed from the other groups in the lack of support they experienced from friends and relatives. Although they received professional encouragement to breastfeed, they were more sheltered from the influence of mass media and social networks. From these findings, it is suggested that different sources of <b>influence</b> <b>are</b> related to different feeding practices. However, to be able to continue with the practice that one has chosen, the availability of social support is essential. Implications of these findings are discussed and several recommendations to promote breastfeeding are made. ...|$|R
