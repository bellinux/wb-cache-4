The disparity appeared crushing. Only in numbers of carrier decks, available aircraft, and submarines was there near parity between the two sides. Despite various mishaps developed in the execution, it appeared that—barring something unforeseen—Yamamoto held all the cards.|$|E

This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be newsgames. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point. For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include Darfur is Dying, Finding Zoe, and In The Balance.

40|$|In {{this day}} and age we carry out our {{purchases}} through different channels. We can shop our clothes and computers in a store or online. Nowadays we can even purchase our groceries through the Internet. The biggest retailer chains within groceries in Sweden have established virtual stores online and are distributing the goods in cities throughout the country. This thesis is dedicated to investigating crucial success factors when going about selling groceries online. Our main research question for this study is “How should a grocery design their business {{if they want to be}} successful selling groceries online”. To answer this question we have used a qualitative method when we carried out our empirical research. We conducted interviews with directors and managers of stores who sell groceries online as well as in stores who don’t. The focus of the study has been on those interviews but we have also gathered relevant models and theories from areas like e-commerce. Our findings have shown us that a grocery who wants to be successful with a virtual store needs to have the right size and location. Furthermore we have concluded that a store needs specific equipment as <b>well</b> as a <b>thought</b> <b>out</b> information systems. We hope our findings can work as a blueprint for the store that wants to sell groceries through the Internet. ...|$|R

Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> <b>out</b> and best of all, difficult enough that you may not get it on your first attempt."

[...] Similarly, Pitchfork Media's Jessica Hooper recognized it as one of the high points on Unapologetic. Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that it is the most tender, affectionate, spirited song on the record, [...] "On an album full of dyspeptic relationships, it is the breath of cool, nourishing air." [...] Jon Reyes of HipHop DX wrote that the song is [...] "a very <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> <b>out</b> move, probably in hopes that it would help soften the impending criticism that Rihanna would receive from singing the pop version of make-up sex with her abusive ex-boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> <b>out</b> as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably {{going to want to}} tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> <b>out,</b> well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete.

500|$|In {{an article}} {{detailing}} various Kirby series video games, IGN {{stated that it}} was a decent platformer, but also very basic compared to later titles. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas and Craig Harris included Kirby's Dream Land in their wishlist for a hypothetical [...] "Virtual Console" [...] for the Nintendo 3DS, commenting that its inclusion would be based on nostalgia rather than it feeling [...] "new and sensational". They also added that original characters like Kirby were the stars of the Game Boy rather than established characters such as Link, Mario, Samus Aran, and Pit. They would again praise Kirby's Dream Land for being an original game in their [...] "History of the Game Boy" [...] article, adding that while [...] "attitude" [...] was common in new platforming mascots, Kirby was cheery and adorable, while the game featured [...] "breezy, casual gameplay and lighthearted atmosphere". GameSpy's Gerald Villoria, Brian Altano, and Ryan Scott called it [...] "basic" [...] compared to later titles in the series, adding that it lacked a sense of danger because Kirby could fly. Nintendo Power editors George and Bob shared roughly similar opinions of the game; George stated that it is a really fun game, owing its quality to its excellent play control and <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> <b>out</b> concept, while Bob stated that it is deceptively simple looking, when it in fact features a decent challenge for more experienced gamers. GamesRadar listed Kirby's Dream Land and its sequel as two of the titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> <b>out,</b> creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E

He {{also said that the}} supposed main character's role was changed to become an observer, [...] "a different outlook than in the previous installments". 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister applauded the character dialogues as being [...] "intelligent, subtle and sharp"; the relationships between characters were lauded as well. Balthier and Fran's relationship was compared to Han Solo and Chewbacca of Star Wars, being [...] "far more interesting than anything Square's put out in the modern FF era". IGN editor Jeremy Dunham praised the game and its writers for [...] "evolving the personalities, histories, and motives of characters you already thought you knew, but didn't" [...] and for [...] "capitaliz on the opportunity to tell you about them". He also noted the visual and auditory detail of the characters, saying that [...] "each and every model, down to the most obscure NPC, has an immense level of attention paid to them -- from their clothes and facial expressions, to their walking and idle animations" [...] and that the voice acting was [...] "top-notch". GameSpy's Justin Speer also praised the characters, saying that it was hard to [...] "resist being charmed by a few of the characters" [...] and that they [...] "interact with each other in dramatic and interesting ways". The voice acting was praised by Keith Schleicher of Gaming Trend, who said that the characters voices all matched their appearances well.|$|E
500|$|The ZX Spectrum {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land {{received}} preview coverage in Your Sinclair magazine. They praised the new additions {{made to the}} game that separated it from Wonder Boy; they called the game [...] "a good arcade adventure with a smattering of strategy thrown in". The magazine reviewed the game four months later. The reviewer noted the diverse level designs and many [...] "surprises" [...] the player will encounter, and they praised the game's learning curve, saying that it [...] "is <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> <b>out</b> and you really {{feel as if you}} made some progress before you die". It was criticized for its long multi-load times on the ZXSpectrum, its jumping mechanics in which the character [...] "floats around", and the graphics which was not as good as its predecessor. The reviewer called Wonder Boy in Monster Land [...] "a souped-up version of Wonderboy, which improves much on the original theory but at a slight cost to gameplay". Reviewers from UK-based magazine The Games Machine called it [...] "probably the best conversion you could expect on the Spectrum". Crash magazine praised the ZXSpectrum version of the game for its detailed sprites and smooth movements, playability, and combat system. The reviewer further commended the game for the differences that set it apart from the original Wonder Boy game, citing the cartoon-like feel and the vast arrays of enemies and items; just as in Your Sinclair, it was criticized for its slow multi-loading. Overall, the reviewer said the game is [...] "great fun for the experienced games player or the person just starting out in the Spectrum world". Sinclair User magazine praised its gameplay, citing the ability to stab enemies with a sword, to collect gold and items left behind, and to go into shops and pubs and buy equipment. Further praise went to the colorful and detailed graphics and animations, though they said they tend not to perform well in more complex background settings. Spanish magazine MicroHobby said that the ZXSpectrum version brought nothing new from its arcade counterpart, but the execution was good; they lauded the game's graphics and its challenging and addictive gameplay, but they criticized it for its lack of originality.|$|E
