5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} {{would be able}} to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance of both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E

If this were accomplished, Lee <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance to shorten the Confederate lines and send a substantial force, or nearly his whole army, to help Johnston.|$|E
25|$|If at {{any point}} in the game a player can use another player's discard to {{complete}} a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they yell out 'Mahjong', take the piece and reveal their hand, with the way of calling it out depending on variations. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If two or three players need the piece to win, {{there are two ways to}} resolve the issue depending on agreed table rules: Either the players compete to see who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> hand in terms of scoring, or simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn wins the game.|$|E

Standing , she was a natural athlete. It soon became clear she was a sports talent, {{but she could not}} decide which sport to pick. A swimming coach advised her to do track because there were already several top swimmers in the Netherlands at that time (such as Rie Mastenbroek), and she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance to qualify for the Olympics in a track event.|$|E

25|$|The Union {{commander}} at Chattanooga, U.S. Grant, {{had ordered}} a {{pursuit of the}} retreating Confederate army {{on the morning of}} November 26, but confusion over the orders prevented the Union forces from getting an early start. The Confederate rear guard had burned the bridges over South Chickamauga Creek, which further delayed the Union forces. Joseph Hooker was given command of divisions from the IV Corps, XI Corps, XII Corps, and XV Corps and ordered to cut the Western and Atlantic Railroad near Graysville. However, he decided to concentrate his forces near the town of Ringgold, thinking that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance of cutting off the Confederate rear guard. Hooker halted two and a half miles from Ringgold Gap during the night of November 2627.|$|E
25|$|Fangio, unlike later Formula One drivers, {{started his}} racing career at a mature age {{and was the}} oldest driver in many of his races. During his career, drivers raced with almost no {{protective}} equipment on circuits with no safety features, although F1 cars back in the 1950s were a lot slower, less physically demanding to drive and less advanced than F1 cars 4 and more decades later. Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if he thought he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance with a better car. As was then common, several of his race results were shared with teammates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems. His rivals included Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina and Stirling Moss. Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of Juan Perón.|$|E
25|$|Fort Enterprise now lay {{less than}} a week's march away, but {{for some of the}} {{starving}} men, that would prove to be an insurmountable barrier. At the back of the line, the two weakest voyageurs, Credit and Vaillant, collapsed and were left where they fell. Richardson and Hood were also too weak to continue. At this point, Franklin split his party. Back, the fittest remaining officer, was sent ahead with three voyageurs to bring food back from Fort Enterprise. Franklin would follow at a slower pace with the remaining voyageurs. Hood and Richardson would stay in their camp, with Hepburn to look after them, in the hope that one of the other parties could bring them food. Franklin was disturbed by the apparent abandonment of Hood and Richardson, but they were insistent that the party <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance of survival without them.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be {{different from what they}} order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskás was {{appointed}} {{as the head}} coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success. He led the team for only four matches, however, as the former Honvéd and Real Madrid star failed to make an impact. The only remarkable success in the 1990s was the qualification of Hungary to the 1996 Summer Olympics. Antal Dunai's team played its first group match against Nigeria and lost to 1–0 in Orlando. In the second group match, Hungary played Brazil and lost to 3–1. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Csaba Madar. The last group match was played against Japan, a 3–2 loss. The Hungarian goals were scored by Csaba Madar and Tamás Sándor. Although the Olympic qualification of the young team was a big surprise and people thought that Hungary <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> future in football history, the team never reached any similar success later.|$|E
25|$|In 1368, Algirdas {{gathered}} a large army, which included his brother Kęstutis and forces from Tver and Smolensk. The army was assembled in secret and marched quietly so that {{not to give}} an advance warning to the Russians. After crossing the Lithuania–Russia border, Lithuanians began pillaging and burning various villages while Russians hastily assembled a defensive force, commanded by Dmitry Minin (boyar of Dmitry Donskoy) and Akinfiev Shuba (boyar of Vladimir the Bold). Lithuanians killed Semion, son of Prince Dmitry of Starodub-on-the-Klyazma. They then captured Obolensk killing Prince Konstantin Obolensky. On November 21, 1368, the Lithuanians defeated the Russian defense forces on the Trosna River and killed its commanders and other boyars. Dmitry Donskoy retreated to Moscow Kremlin, behind the walls that were completed just few months before, and ordered to burn the posad so that the Russian defense <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position. The Lithuanians surrounded the Kremlin, burned and looted, but retreated three days later without a serious attempt at taking the stronghold.|$|E

25|$|In 1773, {{at the age}} of 20, Phillis {{accompanied}} Nathaniel Wheatley to London in {{part for}} her health, but also because Susanna believed she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance publishing her book of poems there. She had an audience with the Lord Mayor of London (an audience with George III was arranged, but Phillis returned home beforehand), as well as with other significant members of British society. Unfortunately, she was never able to personally meet Selina Hastings, the Countess of Huntingdon, who served as the patron of Wheatley's volume of poems, which was published in the summer of 1773. In 1774, Phillis Wheatley wrote a letter to Reverend Samson Occom, commending him on his ideas and beliefs of how the slaves should be given their natural born rights in America. Wheatley also exchanged letters with the British philanthropist John Thornton, who in turn discussed Wheatley and her poetry in his correspondence with John Newton. Along with her poetry, she was able to express her thoughts, comments and concerns to others.|$|E
25|$|On April 2, 2016, the Lightning {{announced}} that Stamkos {{was diagnosed with}} thoracic outlet syndrome, {{which is the same}} injury that sidelined teammate Andrei Vasilevskiy {{at the start of the}} season. It is a condition that is rare among hockey players. Stamkos said that he first felt some discomfort in his arm after the game against the Montreal Canadiens. He is scheduled for surgery on Monday with Dr. Karl Illig, who performed Vasilevskiy's surgery. Lightning General Manager, Steve Yzerman, stated that there will be no long-term impact on Stamkos' health or his career. In addition, Yzerman indicated that Stamkos recovery time would be between one and three months, but they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> idea in a couple of weeks where he falls within that time frame. Yzerman also stated that the team's desire is for Stamkos to remain with the organization, which came after a question of whether Stamkos had played his last game in a Lightning uniform. On April 4, 2016, Stamkos had successful surgery at Tampa General Hospital. Stamkos' surgeon stated that they plan on evaluating him in approximately two weeks and that should clear up his prognosis. On May 26, 2016, Stamkos dressed for game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins despite still being on blood thinners following surgery. He registered five shot attempts during the game, but the Lightning ultimately lost 2-1 and were eliminated from the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|As the 1840 presidential {{election}} approached, many {{expected that the}} Whigs would win control of the presidency {{in the aftermath of}} the Panic of 1837. In 1837, supporters of William Henry Harrison proposed a Whig national convention, and Clay agreed to support the idea. Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival, but Clay, Harrison, and General Winfield Scott emerged as the principal candidates at the 1839 Whig National Convention. Clay's greatest weakness in his bid for the Whig nomination was his lack of strength in the North, as abolitionists and Antimasons both disapproved of Clay. Many Whigs also disliked Clay's American System, and thought that the Whigs ticket <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance being led by a popular military hero rather than a twice-defeated presidential candidate. On the first ballot of the convention, Clay narrowly led Harrison, but Scott also received a solid minority of the vote. During the convention, Thaddeus Stevens, a Pennsylvania Antimason and supporter of Harrison, arranged for the Virginia delegation to receive a letter that showed Scott's anti-slavery views. With Scott's chances badly damaged, Scott's delegates switched to Harrison, giving him the nomination. Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose Virginia Senator John Tyler, a personal friend of Clay, as the vice presidential nominee. Clay was disappointed by the outcome, but helped Harrison's campaign with numerous speeches. Democrats, meanwhile, nominated Van Buren for a second term. Harrison ran on a campaign that emphasized his personal heroism and Van Buren's failures rather than Whig policies. With Van Buren still damaged by the Panic of 1837, Harrison won 52.9% of the popular vote and 234 of the 294 electoral votes.|$|E
