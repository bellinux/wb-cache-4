5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was {{a citizen of the}} United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E

5000|$|The Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, {{which does}} not {{recognise}} dual citizenship, provides for automatic loss of PRC citizenship when a former PRC citizen both settles in another country and acquires foreign citizenship. For children born overseas of a PRC citizen, whether the child receives PRC citizenship at birth depends on whether the PRC parent has settled overseas: [...] "Any person born abroad <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> both Chinese nationals or one of <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> <b>is</b> a Chinese national shall have Chinese nationality. But a person <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> both Chinese nationals and have both settled abroad, or one of <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> <b>is</b> a Chinese national and has settled abroad, and who has acquired foreign nationality at birth shall not have Chinese nationality" [...] (Art 5).|$|R

5|$|Thorpe, <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> both half Caucasian, {{was raised}} as an American Indian. His accomplishments {{occurred}} {{during a period}} of severe racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.* Elfers. pg. 18 While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view. At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.citizens. (The U.S.government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.|$|E
5|$|Rinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, {{a suburb}} of {{northern}} Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.|$|E
