5|$|By mid-1918, the German Army {{had been}} fought to a {{standstill}} after its Spring Offensive and the Allies had sought to take the initiative. Accordingly, the Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August, with an attack on Amiens which {{marked the beginning of}} a series of advances by the Allies that ultimately ended the war. By late October, the New Zealand Division, commanded by Major General Andrew Russell, along <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the British Third Army, had advanced {{to the west of the}} town of Le Quesnoy.|$|E
5|$|Despite Langdale's {{attempt to}} counter-charge, the Royalists were soon outflanked. With the Parliamentarian musketeers firing {{into the rear}} of Langdale's force, the Royalists broke, some {{escaping}} via Holt Bridge and others running towards Chester. On Hoole Heath these retreating soldiers met <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Gerard's force and made an initially successful counter-attack before being forced back to the walls of Chester. There the retreating cavalry choked up the streets, allowing the Parliamentarian musketeers to fire into the confused mass of horsemen and leading to a rout.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E

While developing Frog Fractions, Crawford said that {{he came up with}} a lot of other video game ideas, but he then realized that he could implement them immediately into Frog Fractions rather than start a new project, due to the game's unpredictable nature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the War Office and the Office of Works held discussions on how to manage the castle. In 1908, Portland was placed onto what was known as the Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would {{continue}} to use and manage the historic property, but with input on repairs from the Office of Works. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Portland Harbour became an important naval base and the castle was used an ordnance store. The castle became a military residence again in the interwar years, and during the Second World War it was used for accommodation and offices by British and US soldiers, <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the castle used once again for storing ordnance. A concrete pillbox, since demolished, was constructed alongside the castle early on in the war.|$|E

They were then ordered to join George Washington in New Jersey, eventually repairing to the city of Trenton in November.|$|E

5|$|The Allied {{victory at}} Salamis ended the {{immediate}} threat to Greece, and Xerxes now returned to Asia <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the army, leaving his general Mardonius {{to attempt to}} complete the conquest. Mardonius wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly, and the Athenians were thus {{able to return to}} their city, which had been burnt and razed by the Persians, for the winter. For the Athenians, and Themistocles personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the Persian army; the Athenians tried to shame them into doing so, with no success.|$|E

5|$|The Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B) was a tube railway {{company which}} had been {{purchased}} by the DR in 1898, but had remained a separate financial entity. It had permission to construct a line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus, but had not raised the capital to do so. At South Kensington it was to connect to the deep level line planned by the DR. On 12 September 1901, the DR-controlled board of the B sold the company to the MDETC. In the same month, the B took over the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN), a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park. The routes of the B and GN were subsequently linked and combined <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the DR's tube route to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP).|$|E

5|$|The captain {{ordered the}} ship {{abandoned}} {{later in the}} day, and the carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit with a slight list to port and down by the bow. Over {{the next couple of}} days, more compartments in the ship flooded and she settled {{on the bottom of the}} harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased through the next day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light.|$|E

5|$|The {{segments}} of NY394 between Westfield and Mayville, {{as well as}} east of Jamestown were originally designated as NY17 in 1924. Six years later, the remainder of current NY394 gained a pair of designations {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, by the mid-1940s, the MayvilleJamestown stretch was solely designated as New York State Route17J. In November 1973, NY17 was realigned onto the new Southern Tier Expressway east of Jamestown. The former alignment of NY17 between Jamestown and Steamburg and all of NY17J were redesignated as NY394. NY394 was extended westward to Barcelona shortly afterward. Today the route is also concurrent <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> New York State Bicycle Route17.|$|E
5|$|The sub-surface {{station has}} twice {{been damaged by}} explosions.

The bomb damaged the train it was on and a passing train along <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the station and the signal box. Sixty-two passengers were injured. On the night of 13 October 1940, the station was hit by German bombs dropped during The Blitz killing five people in the station with four more subsequently dying of injuries.|$|E
5|$|This early era was {{followed}} by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupuaa generally {{took the form of}} long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupuaa of Kaohe, <b>with</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humuula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–naio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis), nēnē (Branta sandvicensis), and palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koa–ōhia forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.|$|E
