5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} <b>women</b> {{to participate}} in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many <b>women</b> a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred <b>women</b> from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using <b>women</b> as political shield. When <b>women</b> insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those <b>women</b> who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian <b>women</b> joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the <b>women</b> marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ <b>women</b> were {{encouraged}} to participate {{since the beginning of}} the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of <b>women,</b> but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of <b>women</b> was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, father or son, <b>women</b> are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other <b>women</b> and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of <b>women</b> sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages <b>women</b> from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for <b>women</b> to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E

5|$|Female {{homosexual}} {{behavior may}} be present in every culture, although {{the concept of a}} lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other <b>women</b> is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. <b>Women</b> in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary <b>women</b> dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European <b>women</b> were not associated with Islamic <b>women.</b> The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured <b>women</b> who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other <b>women</b> for the attentions of men.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} <b>women</b> in prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once {{she received}} her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps <b>women</b> leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 <b>women</b> {{out of the}} sex trade. <b>Women</b> entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 <b>women.</b> Of these <b>women,</b> 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of <b>women</b> in prostitution in Canada because the <b>women</b> she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the <b>women</b> she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that <b>women</b> in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the <b>women</b> she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
