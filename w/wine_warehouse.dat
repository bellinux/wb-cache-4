Since 1972, the public entrance has been through the Coopers' Hall, the earliest surviving building on the site. The Coopers' Hall was built in 1744 for the Coopers' Company, the guild of coopers in Bristol, by architect William Halfpenny. It has a [...] "debased Palladian" [...] façade with four Corinthian columns.

50|$|The {{history of}} the prison starts in the 1730s. During the reign of Anna Ioannovna, Vinny Gorodok (Wine Town) was a {{warehouse}} complex where all the wine {{for the city of}} Saint Petersburg was held. After the Emancipation reform of 1861 the need for prison space greatly increased; before the reforms, serfs were incarcerated by their landowners and after the reforms they were put in state prisons. Thus, in 1867 the <b>wine</b> <b>warehouse</b> was transformed into a 700-bed prison separated into female and male areas. The reconstruction of the <b>wine</b> <b>warehouse</b> was developed by Vladislav Lvov, the chairman of the Saint Petersburg Prison Committee.|$|E
50|$|In the 1870s, trade blossomed in Izhevsky Zavod. Bodalev Brothers, Mokletsov, Ogloblin, Sveshnikov, and Sozykin {{were the}} most {{successful}} merchants. It was profitable to deal in spirits. There were three vodka distilleries, four <b>wine</b> <b>warehouses,</b> three <b>wine</b> cellars, and about fifty taverns in 1872. This year Ivan Bodalev opened his brewery {{on the bank of}} the reservoir.|$|R

50|$|An 1828 census {{records for}} Agios Konstantinos 254 {{inhabitants}} with 112 men and 141 women. Agios Konstantinos was then mostly {{in place of}} the present day Ano (Upper) Agios Konstantinos. The lower beachfront settlement consisted mainly of a few <b>wine</b> <b>warehouses</b> closer to where shipping was accessible. Continued development of wine production in the region supported the population to reach 600 by 1920 and 800 {{by the end of the}} decade, which by then also included some refugees from the nearby Asia Minor Catastrophe.|$|R

5000|$|Founded as [...] "Moscow State <b>Wine</b> <b>Warehouse</b> №1" [...] in 1901 on {{the banks}} of the Yauza river, the {{distillery}} employed 1,500 people and produced 2,100,000 state vodka buckets (approximately 2.6 million decalitres) in its first year. At the beginning, production was divided among three quality divisions: 'simple', 'improved', and 'boyarskaya'.|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} the <b>wine</b> <b>warehouses</b> of Paris were {{located on the}} bank of the Seine at Bercy. They are now being destroyed to be replaced by a sports and recreation park. Before the XIXe century fashionable houses and their parks and gardens were located on the site. Between the buildings and cellars of the Bercy warehouses, part of the vegetation had persisted and a number of spontaneous and subspontaneous plants had settled. Bercy then provided an opportunity to study the dynamics of vegetation in an urban environment. Lizet Bernadette, Jovet Paul.

50|$|Owned and {{operated}} by the Porto Metro, the single-track funicular uses a central loop system that is 281 m long, allowing it to descend 61 m, with the upper 90 m situated within the passenger tunnel, with the markedly steep gradient in the section below the passing loop. Two vehicles run the course, with a capacity for 25 persons each, operating at a maximum speed of 5 m/s. Due to the difference in slope along the line, the cars have self-levelling platforms, allowing the car floor to maintain itself horizontal no matter the track incline. Although the journey is short (approximately 3 minutes) after emerging from the upper tunnel, passengers are able to view the landscape from the Dom Luís I Bridge, the river margins (including both quays along Ribeira and Cais de Gaia and the Port <b>wine</b> <b>warehouses</b> and traditional boats along the Douro River.|$|R
50|$|The {{wine storage}} and wine {{department}} with {{a capacity of}} 600 thousands of decaliters were opened in 1960. The range of beverages was more than 60 products (red wines, brandy, liquors) prepared from natural raw material purchased in France and Spain. <b>Wine</b> <b>warehouse</b> was built in 1964, bottling department - in 1966.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, Sandpiper {{started its}} Pet and Home Discount Centre branded 'shop-in-shops'. The concept was {{discount}} products at unbeatable prices.

The 'shop-in-shop' areas that Pet and Home Discount Centre took up now house Checkers Xpress, Greggs, Iceland, and <b>Wine</b> <b>Warehouse</b> stores.|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays, special {{orders are}} to be placed at the store at 233, rue Saint-Honoré, {{as it was the}} case when the factory was located in Bezons. Special orders are entirely hand-made in the Goyard {{workshops}} in southern France, in the Aude department. The workshops are installed in converted <b>wine</b> <b>warehouses.</b> Whilst some trunk makers specialize in standardized goods, Goyard is equally at ease with both special orders and ready-made items. Among the many extravagant special orders that Goyard was able to deliver over the course of its history, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s [...] "Writer’s trunk" [...] certainly stands out. In the report he wrote for the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in 1925, Paul Léon lists its main characteristics: [...] "The trunk is equipped with a filing cabinet, a bookcase, a typewriter and a foldable desk." [...] The descriptive text that goes with its patent spares no detail either: [...] "All kinds of kits and sets can be placed in the pigeonhole located in the trunk lid, along with photograph frames, a watch, a thermometer and a barometer". After the death of the creator of Sherlock Holmes on 7 July 1930, Edmond Goyard registered a patent for the trunk on 20 July 1931, and seldom remanufactured this exceptional piece.|$|R
5000|$|Yellow v moth (Oinophila v-flava) - in Britain and Ireland {{the moth}} is found usually indoors in, for example, <b>wine</b> cellars and <b>warehouses,</b> where the larva feed on wine corks and fungus. Larvae were found under the flaking bark of Pittosporum crassifolium by Robert Heckford in 1986 at Old Town Bay, St Mary's.|$|R
500|$|The second {{location}} {{was an old}} record distribution depot in Barlby Road, North Kensington in North West London [...] Filming began here in March 1987. In 1989, {{the owners of the}} Barlby Road site ordered The Bill out, due to their redevelopment plans for the area. After an extensive search, two sites were selected, the favourite being a disused hospital in Clapham. However, this fell through and the second option was chosen – [...] an old <b>wine</b> distribution <b>warehouse</b> in Merton, South West London. The move was made in March 1990 and was disguised on screen by the 'ongoing' refurbishment of Sun Hill police station and then finally the explosion of a terrorist car-bomb in the station car-park, which ended up killing PC Ken Melvin.|$|R
5000|$|Graner {{opened his}} first <b>wine</b> <b>warehouse</b> in Harringay, North London, in 1980, under the {{management}} of Tony Mason, brought in by Graner to manage the day to day activities. The second store was opened in Battersea in May 1981. In the middle of 1981, the group called in receivers, and was bought by investment banker Giles Clarke, where as Chairman Clarke built it into a national chain in the country.|$|E
50|$|Cultivations of {{different}} products practices: cereals, vineyards, olive tree, lentils, garlic… Campillo {{always has been}} known by its saffron, and although its culture has diminished much, exists an enterprise initiative to commercialize it at national and even at international level. The Agricultural Cooperative San Andrés Apóstolcounts on around 800 partners. One is in charge to serve to the agriculturists (cereal distribution, seeds and installments) and also works as <b>wine</b> <b>warehouse</b> and oil mill.|$|E
5000|$|In the Middle Ages, a {{municipal}} wine-house was {{situated on the}} corner of Bremer Marktplatz/Liebfrauenkirchhof and Obernstrasse. Later on, the building was redecorated with a Renaissance gable. Until the 17th century, the building was used as a <b>wine</b> <b>warehouse.</b> Later on it passed into private ownership and was remodeled on several occasions. In 1900, it was used as a lingerie store. Thereafter, it was purchased by the city and demolished to provide space for a new building.|$|E
60|$|Several ships lay by the wharves. Some {{were bound}} for England, others for Holland. Some were freighted for the {{northern}} ports of France, and some, of smaller size, for Paris itself. Several men came up to offer their services, {{as soon as the}} boat was alongside; and these, when they saw that the owner of the wines had brought men with them, who would transport the <b>wine</b> to the <b>warehouses,</b> indulged in some rough jeers before moving away.|$|R
25|$|In Spain, wineries are {{commonly}} referred to as bodegas though this term may also refer to a <b>wine</b> cellar or <b>warehouse.</b> For quite some time, the Rioja wine industry has been dominated by local family vineyards and co-operatives that have bought the grapes and make the wine. Some bodegas would buy fermented wine from the co-ops and age the wine to sell under their own label. In recent times there has been more emphasis on securing vineyard land and making estate bottled wines from the bodegas.|$|R
