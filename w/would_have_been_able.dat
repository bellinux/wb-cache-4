5|$|Although the RF-4M {{would have}} had some advantages, it was {{discounted}} as the cost would have been greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while only those that had been modified <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to undertake the reconnaissance mission. Ultimately, the RAF chose the standard F-4M and external pod, which allowed all of its aircraft to perform all designated roles.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having a}} main {{military}} goal of deterrence, strategists envisioned the Swiss nuclear strike capability {{as part of}} a preemptive war against the Soviets. The Swiss Air Force Mirage III jet <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to carry nuclear bombs as far as Moscow. They also suggested the weapons could be used on Swiss soil against a possible invading force.|$|E
5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} {{had been}} created without {{a set of rules}} or boundaries to govern the storylines. He said he felt his writing staff <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to work more effectively if there had been more guidelines on the characters' behavior and function. Henson said he felt the type of humor being written for the show was tedious and unimaginative.|$|E
50|$|For Bob to cheat, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to guess}} Alice’s basis with a {{probability}} greater than ½. In order to accomplish this, Bob <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to determine a}} train of photons randomly polarized in one basis from a train of photons polarized in another basis.|$|R
50|$|Imbibition is {{a special}} type of {{diffusion}} when water is absorbed by solids-colloids causing an enormous increase in volume. Examples include the absorption of water by seeds and dry wood. If {{it were not for}} the pressure due to imbibition, seedlings <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to emerge out of soil into the open; they probably <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to establish.|$|R
50|$|Edward had {{followers}} {{from the}} Scottish nobility who <b>would</b> also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> {{to verify the}} stone's authenticity.|$|R
5|$|Regardless of {{what time}} {{they entered the}} straits, the Persians did not move to attack the Allies until daylight. Since they were not {{planning}} to flee after all, the Allies <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> {{to spend the night}} preparing for battle, and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{consideration}} of the likely outcome of invasion, including the 1974 Royal Military Academy Sandhurst war game, agree that while German forces <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to land and gain a significant beachhead, intervention of the Royal Navy would have been decisive and, even with the most optimistic assumptions, the German army would not have penetrated further than GHQ Line {{and would have been}} defeated.|$|E
5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only have}} been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5000|$|At {{least some}} of the women who worked at Sheik arrived in such a state of poverty that the nightclub or its {{managers}} had to extend credit for the airplane fare, clothes for the women to wear while working, and housing. The employees <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to work at Sheik and the nightclub <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to recruit and keep employees without making loans to them.|$|R

5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to use most of {{the common}} weapons in U.S.'s inventory, {{including}} {{the entire range of}} Mark 80 series bombs, the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, and the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles. Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted in the nose. Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and had a higher rate of fire than the M39A2.|$|E
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E
50|$|The {{scene in}} which Utah jumps after Bodhi without a {{parachute}} was ranked seventh in Empire magazine's Top 10 Crazy Action Sequences. The scene was also tested by the Discovery Channel series MythBusters. It was determined that Utah and Bodhi <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to free-fall for 90 seconds (as in the film), nor <b>would</b> they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to hold a conversation in mid-air. However, it was determined that, by streamlining his body, Utah could have conceivably caught up with Bodhi after jumping from the plane.|$|R

5|$|While Britain {{may have}} been militarily secure in 1940, both sides {{were aware of the}} {{possibility}} of a political collapse. If the Germans had won the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to strike anywhere in southern England and with the prospect of an invasion, the British government would have come under pressure to come to terms: the extensive anti-invasion preparations demonstrated to Germany and to the people of Britain that whatever happened in the air, the United Kingdom was both able and willing to defend itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E

50|$|With {{sufficiently}} reduced thrust in {{the right}} engine and maintained thrust (not increased) in the left engine, the engines <b>would</b> probably not <b>have</b> failed. The aircraft <b>would</b> then <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to return for landing.|$|R
50|$|Legally, the RS {{referendum}} <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> {{to impede}} or influence {{the work of}} the state judicial institutions, which are established under state law. Yet, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> raised inter-ethnic tensions in the country.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s, the Yakovlev Yak-38, {{then the}} Soviet Navy's only {{operational}} carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, {{was found to}} be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's Project 1143 carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to operate the MiG-23s and Su-24s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which would have accommodated the Su-25s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for Yak-141, MiG-29K and Su-27K operations.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced {{to come up with a}} new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to reach the runway.|$|E
2500|$|Payment of {{the charge}} would be via a pre-pay [...] "tag and beacon" [...] system. Credit was to be {{automatically}} deducted from a driver's account as they passed each of the cordons. Occasional visitors to Manchester without a pre-pay tag <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to pay via call centre or internet, but there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a surcharge. The scheme was planned to {{be up and running}} by mid-2013, by which time it was anticipated that 80% of the public transport improvements <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completed.|$|R
50|$|The second {{quantization}} procedure relies crucially on {{the particles}} being identical.
