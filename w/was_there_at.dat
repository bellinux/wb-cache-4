They collaborated on deriving a series of wave equations similar to the Schrödinger equation for photons. Unfortunately, their equations, while complicated, were nonsensical. In 1930, Peierls travelled to the Netherlands to meet Hans Kramers, and to Copenhagen to meet Niels Bohr.|$|E

25|$|According to {{writings}} of the period, Thomas Heywood {{had been living in}} Clerkenwell since 1623 and it <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>at</b> St. James's Church that he was buried eighteen years later. Because of the uncertainty regarding the year of his birth, his age can only be estimated, but he was likely in his late sixties, possibly having reached seventy. The date of the burial, 16 August 1641, the only documented date, also appears in a number of reference books as Heywood's death date, although he may actually have died days earlier. It may be presumed, however, that due to a possible August heatwave, the burial occurred on an expedited basis.|$|E
25|$|He was vicar of Christ Church, Silloth, Cumbria 1890–1901. He was the Associate Secretary for CCCS for the {{north-east}} district 1890–1899. He {{took up the}} benefice of St Mark's in December 1901 by {{exchange with}} Reverend Humble and remained there until 1905. In Huddersfield in 1904 he married Martha Elizabeth Storry (1855–1942). In 1905 he became rector of Steeple Gidding, and <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> least until 1908. He then became vicar of Holme, Peterborough, where he stayed until his death. The 1911 Census finds James and Martha living at the 11-room Holme Vicarage with his son Reginald Keith Sowter (b.1897) the son of his first wife Minnie, and a servant. James died aged 62 of heart failure following an operation, on 24 August 1917 at Brighton. His wife Martha died in 1942 in Bournemouth, aged 87.|$|E
25|$|The Republic's {{delegates to}} the Treaty Negotiations were {{accredited}} by President de Valera and his cabinet as plenipotentiaries (that is, negotiators with the legal authority to sign a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty. The Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a dominion of the British Commonwealth with the King represented by a Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The Irish Treaty delegates Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton, and Michael Collins supported by Robert Erskine Childers as Secretary General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 Hans Place in Knightsbridge. It <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>at</b> 11.15am on 5 December 1921, that {{the decision was made}} to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann; the Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:20 on 6 December 1921.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{attribute}} {{her debut}} to Venice at La Fenice, as Odabella in Verdi's Attila. She appeared {{in that role}} at Udine on 24 July 1847, and later as Lucrezia in I due Foscari in the same theatre. Later in 1847 she was singing Odabella in Rovigo, and it <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of that}} year, that Benjamin Lumley heard and ('struck with the splendid voice, the impulsive dramatic temperament, the spirit, and the captivating person') recruited her for the season of 1848 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, of which he was the impresario. The family objected that she was too young to face the English public, but Lumley was urged to proceed by the tenor Rubini: 'I tell you plainly, and with deep conviction, that you are making an excellent acquisition. A most beautiful voice – give her good models and a good maestro'. Sophie herself was delighted with the proposals. In the winter of 1847 she made several appearances at La Fenice.|$|E

500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when it happened. On the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench, holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis who <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> the game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo. Cherry calls it the [...] "ultimate picture" [...] of Wilt Chamberlain.|$|E
500|$|The family {{settled in}} a small house loaned to them by Princess George of Greece at Saint-Cloud, on the {{outskirts}} of Paris, where Princess Andrew helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees. She became deeply religious, and on 20 October 1928 entered the Greek Orthodox Church. That winter, she translated her husband's defence of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War into English. Soon afterward, she began claiming that she was receiving divine messages and that she had healing powers. In 1930, after suffering a severe nervous breakdown, Princess Andrew was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, first by Thomas Ross, a psychiatrist who specialised in shell-shock, and subsequently by Sir Maurice Craig, who treated the future King George VI before he had speech therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed at Dr Ernst Simmel's sanatorium at Tegel, Berlin. She was forcibly removed from her family and placed in Dr Ludwig Binswanger's sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. It was a famous and well-respected institution with several celebrity patients, including Vaslav Nijinsky, the ballet dancer and choreographer, who <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> the same time as Princess Andrew. Binswanger also diagnosed schizophrenia. Both he and Simmel consulted Sigmund Freud who believed that the princess's delusions were the result of sexual frustration. He recommended [...] "X-raying her ovaries in order to kill off her libido." [...] Princess Andrew protested her sanity and repeatedly tried to leave the asylum.|$|E
