40|$|Abstract: The author {{argues that}} the recent {{controversy}} over {{the effect of the}} minimum wage on employment offers an opportunity for teaching introductory economics. Research findings on the minimum wage could be used to motivate alternative models of the labor market, such as monopsony and search models, and to teach students how economists test hypotheses with data. Key words: minimum wage, monopsony, natural experiment JEL codes: J 3, A 2 A common reaction that David Card and I have received from colleagues on our research on the minimum wage is: <b>What</b> really <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> about your work is that now I have to stop using the minimum wage to illustrate the usefulness of the supply and demand model in my introductory economics class. I {{have to come up with}} another example. Indeed, a casual survey of introductory economics textbooks suggests that the minimum wage has become a less-central example in the teaching of microeconomics than it used to be. This reaction strikes me as unfortunate. Did astronom...|$|R
60|$|It was then, I think, that I first apprehended clearly {{how that}} {{opposition}} to which I have already alluded {{of the immediate}} life and the mental hinterland of a man, {{can be applied to}} public and social affairs. The ideas go on--and no person or party succeeds in embodying them. The reality of human progress never comes to the surface, it is a power in the deeps, an undertow. It goes on in silence while men think, in studies where they write self-forgetfully, in laboratories under the urgency of an impersonal curiosity, in the rare illumination of honest talk, in moments of emotional insight, in thoughtful reading, but not in everyday affairs. Everyday affairs and whatever is made an everyday affair, are transactions of the ostensible self, the being of habits, interests, usage. Temper, vanity, hasty reaction to imitation, personal feeling, are their substance. No man can abolish his immediate self and specialise in the depths; if he attempt that, he simply turns himself into something a little less than the common man. He may have an immense hinterland, but that does not absolve him from a frontage. That is the essential error of the specialist philosopher, the specialist teacher, the specialist publicist. They repudiate frontage; claim to be pure hinterland. That is <b>what</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> about Codger, about those various schoolmasters who had prepared me for life, about the Baileys and their dream of an official ruling class. A human being who is a philosopher in the first place, a teacher in the first place, or a statesman in the first place, is thereby and inevitably, though he bring God-like gifts to the pretence--a quack. These are attempts to live deep-side shallow, inside out. They produce merely a new pettiness. To understand Socialism, again, is to gain a new breadth of outlook; to join a Socialist organisation is to join a narrow cult which is not even tolerably serviceable in presenting or spreading the ideas for which it stands....|$|R

"By {{the end of}} May {{the ground}} was covered deep with snow, and the cold set in bitter. <b>What</b> had <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> most of all was where I was to store my stock of frozen meat and blubber.

At last I {{determined}} to put it in a hole something like that I had made into a den for myself. This hole was not like mine, on a level with the ground, but was on the face of a smooth cliff about forty feet high. I made a rope of seal-skin, fastened it to a projection in the rock over the hole, and lowered myself down. I found the place would do well, and was quite big enough for all my store, while the face of the rock was too steep to climb, even for a bear. So I carried all my stock up to the top, and climbing up and down the rope, stored it in the hole, except what I wanted for a week's consumption.|$|R
40|$|<b>What</b> {{has always}} <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> about the "experimentalist" {{school is the}} false sense of {{certainty}} it conveys. My view, like Leamer's, {{is that there is}} no way to escape the role of assumptions in statistical work, so our conclusions will always be contingent. Hence, we should be circumspect about our degree of knowledge. I present some lessons for economics from the field of marketing, a field where broad consensus has been reached on many key issues over the past twenty years. In marketing, 1) the structural paradigm is dominant, 2) the data are a lot better than in some fields of economics, and 3) there is great emphasis on external validation. Of course, good data always helps. I emphasize that the ability to do controlled experiments does not obviate the need for theory, and finally I address different approaches to model validation. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{am pleased}} and honored {{that such an}} {{impressive}} group of commentators considered my book Making Use (Carroll, 2000) worthy of discussion and analysis. I would not expect, nor even prefer really, to have everyone agree with <b>me.</b> <b>What</b> would <b>bother</b> <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> would <b>bother</b> any author, is to not be read at all. Dan Diaper’s critical review and the commentaries by David Benyon/Catriona Macaulay, Tom Carey, and Fabio Paternò, will help to make that less likely! Many important themes are raised in Diaper (2002) review and in the commentaries. In this response I want to concentrate on refining {{a few of the}} main issues and distinctions. First, I briefly consider contrasts in values. I think that preferences for scenario-based design versus traditional task analytic methods reflect differences in the underlying world views and values of designers and researchers. To some extent, therefore, the issues in this discussion are not just technical, but paradigmatic and moral. Second, I consider the state of design practices in HCI and its implications for where onus lies in contemporary methodological argumentation and for what sorts of data are pertinent and required to address outstanding methodological issues. Finally, I consider the question of how task analysis, in the sense of structured task decomposition, might be reconstructed in the emerging paradigm of scenario-based design. 1. Design is about values Design is a multifaceted endeavor that always raises fundamental questions of method and values. One must always be skeptical of claims that a design method ‘works’, because in design, works is a loaded term. It is loaded with values. For example, a designer cannot simply mouth HCI motherhoods like ‘the design should optimize human performance’, ‘the design should afford immediate learning by exploration’, ‘the designed system shoul...|$|R

His wife Wanda soon followed, taking a job at Los Alamos as a human computer, working for Bethe and Edward Teller. Hamming later recalled that: Shortly before the first field test (you realize that no small scale experiment can be done—either you have a critical mass or you do not), a man asked me to check some arithmetic he had done, and I agreed, thinking to fob it off on some subordinate. When I asked what it was, he said, [...] "It is the probability that the test bomb will ignite the whole atmosphere." [...] I decided I would check it myself! The next day when he came for the answers I remarked to him, [...] "The arithmetic was apparently correct but I do not know about the formulas for the capture cross sections for oxygen and nitrogen—after all, there could be no experiments at the needed energy levels." [...] He replied, like a physicist talking to a mathematician, that he wanted me to check the arithmetic not the physics, and left. I said to myself, [...] "What have you done, Hamming, you are involved in risking all of life that is known in the Universe, and you do not know much of an essential part?"

It is no accident that Poème Symphonique was rejected as much by the petit-bourgeois (see the cancellation of the TV broadcast in the Netherlands) as by the seeming radicals....
