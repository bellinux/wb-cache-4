2500|$|On April 14, 1908, {{at about}} 2:30 PM, Hauser Dam—a steel dam about 90 miles {{upstream}} from Great Falls— failed. A surge of water [...] to [...] high swept downstream. A Great Northern Railway locomotive was {{dispatched to the}} city of Great Falls, warning stations along the way about the dam break. Workers at the Boston and Montana Smelter in Great Falls improvised a <b>wing</b> <b>dam</b> to deflect the floodwaters away from the smelter site and dynamited a portion of Black Eagle Dam to allow the floodwaters to go downstream. Their efforts were not needed, as the Missouri River only rose [...] by the time it reached that city. Two deaths occurred while the dynamiting attempt was made, however: One man drowned while trying to remove flashboards from the dam, and another drowned when his boat capsized.|$|E

50|$|While <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> {{assist in}} assuring that rivers are navigable, {{they can also}} {{pose a threat to}} boaters. Many <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> are often {{underwater}} and may be difficult to see, and can easily be struck by vessels. On the other hand, fishermen intentionally fish the quieter waters downstream of <b>wing</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} channel has a flat bottom and vertical sides. The flow diverters are {{two pairs of}} concrete <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> and clusters of vertical blue and green plastic bollards attached to peg boards on the channel bottom. A foot bridge across the channel joins the first pair of <b>wing</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{action of}} <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> is complex. Where they are installed, {{sediment}} {{is removed from}} the center of the river, but sediment is also carried further down the river where it has secondary effects. Some researchers believe that flooding is increased by wing dams; a 2013 theoretical analysis predicts that <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> may lead to water level lowering for in-bank flows and to water level increases for out-of-bank (flood) flows.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE; This note {{provides}} Information on {{the value}} of <b>wing</b> <b>dams,</b> which reduce dredging requirements 1 n large rivers, for freshwater mussels. BACKGROUND; W 1 ng dams are longitudinal rock-rubble structures placed 1 n waterways to develop and stabilize channels. Wing dams constrict low flows, which decreases maintenance dredging requirements (Shields 1983). These structures are usually oriented obliquely or at 90 deg to the current. Sedi-ment deposition usually occurs between <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> where current velocity is reduced relative to that in the unprotected main channel. W 1 ng dams create quiescent areas that are similar to naturally occurring lentic habitats during normal and low flow (Beckett et al. 1983). In addition, <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> themselves are a coarse-grained substrate used by aquatic Insects and fishes (Conner...|$|R
50|$|The Mississippi River in North America has {{thousands}} of <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> which were originally constructed {{to reduce the}} amount of dredging required when the main navigation channel was maintained to at least 4+1/2 ft. Since that time, additional conventional dams have been built to increase the water level in the river, doubling the depth of the navigation channel to 9 ft. The <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> still serve their purpose, but to a lesser extent than before.|$|R

50|$|For {{navigation}} purposes, the Missouri River {{is divided}} into two main sections. The Upper Missouri River is north of Gavins Point Dam, the last hydroelectric dam of fifteen on the river, just upstream from Sioux City, Iowa. The Lower Missouri River is the 840 mi of river below Gavins Point until it meets the Mississippi just above St. Louis. The Lower Missouri River has no hydroelectric dams or locks but it has a plethora of <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> that enable barge traffic by directing the flow of the river into a 200 ft, 12 ft channel. These <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> have been put in place by and are maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and there currently are no plans to construct any locks to replace these <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> on the Missouri River.|$|R

50|$|Another form of jetties, <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> are {{extended}} out, opposite one another, {{from each}} bank of a river, at intervals, to contract a wide channel, and by {{concentration of the}} current to produce a deepening.|$|R
50|$|A <b>wing</b> <b>dam</b> or wing dike is a manmade barrier that, {{unlike a}} {{conventional}} dam, only extends partway into a river. These structures force {{water into a}} fast-moving center channel which reduces the rate of sediment accumulation, while slowing water flow near the riverbanks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{total length}} of the dam is 7235 m. The crest {{elevation}} is 225 m. Itaipu is actually four dams joined together - from the far left, an earth fill dam, a rock fill dam, a concrete buttress main dam, and a concrete <b>wing</b> <b>dam</b> to the right.|$|E
50|$|The {{course was}} {{redesigned}} {{in the fall}} of 2002, once again by John Anderson. A new scale model was built, this one outdoors and onsite. After testing his new arrangement of flow-diversion features on the model, he specified new locations for some of the artificial boulders. The <b>wing</b> <b>dam</b> on the left side was moved downstream into section four. A crane was deployed for the moving job.|$|E
50|$|Along the Lower Wisconsin {{there were}} {{initially}} no plans for improvements other than dredging and the clearing of snags. This soon {{proved to be}} inadequate. In 1868, the Corps began to experiment with <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> and dredging to sluice out a 6-foot (1.8 m) deep channel. By 1880, the Corps had completed 157 dams totaling over 76000 ft, mainly in two sections: between Portage and Prairie du Sac and between Lone Rock and Boscobel. But the <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> also proved inadequate and steamboats were not willing to risk the passage. In 1887, the Corps recommended to stop this method of improvement, effectively closing the Lower Wisconsin to commercial traffic.|$|R

50|$|The United States then {{built the}} Red <b>Wing</b> <b>Dam</b> on the Mississippi River. The dam raised {{the water level}} of the Mississippi above Red Wing and also that of the St. Croix. The effect was to {{decrease}} the available head of water at the hydroelectric plant by three feet, decreasing the power output from the turbines and requiring the power company to purchase electric power from other sources. The economic loss to the power company was $25,000. The power company sued the United States for a taking and was awarded $25,000. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{lock and}} dams {{on the lower}} Missouri River, {{but there are plenty}} of <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> that jettie out into the river and make it harder for barges to navigate. In contrast, the upper Mississippi has 29 locks and dams and {{averaged}} 61.3 million tons of cargo annually from 2008 to 2011, and its locks are closed in the winter.|$|R

The fish were mostly sedentary, butsometimes they moved up to 11. 7 km/d. Most movements occurred in May and July and thefewest in April and June. Long-range movements up to 17 km were noted between activitycenters (areas occupied for 3 – 93 d). Among 22 radio-tagged shovelnose sturgeons, eightshowed homing behaviour. The fish were frequently located at water depths of 2 – 7 m, wherecurrents were 20 – 40 cm/s {{at the bottom and}} 40 – 70 cm/s at the surface. During spring high-riverstages, shovelnose sturgeons were located most frequently downstream from <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> (rockand brush structures built perpendicular to river flow in the main channel), downstream fromclosing dams (rock and brush structures built across side channels), and at the border of the mainchannel within 50 m of shore. During low-river stages in summer, they were usually close to or inthe main channel or on the upstream side of <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> and closing dams...|$|R
50|$|The USACE {{began work}} on {{ecosystem}} restoration projects along the lower Missouri River in the early 21st century. Because of the low use of the shipping channel in the lower Missouri maintained by the USACE, it is now considered feasible to {{remove some of the}} levees, dikes, and <b>wing</b> <b>dams</b> that constrict the river's flow, thus allowing it to naturally restore its banks. By 2001, there were 87000 acre of riverside floodplain undergoing active restoration.|$|R
