5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie <b>Winkle</b> {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein.

5|$|On July2, 1935, the Rip Van <b>Winkle</b> Bridge {{over the}} Hudson River between Catskill and Greenport was opened to traffic.

Plans {{were made in the}} early 1950s to construct a southern bypass of the city of Hudson between the Rip Van <b>Winkle</b> Bridge and NY23 midway between Claverack and Hollowville. Construction on the portion of the highway between the bridge and US9 south of Hudson began in the mid-1950s and was completed in the late 1950s as a realignment of NY23. Ultimately, this was the only section that was built; as a result, NY23 overlapped with US9 and NY9H to reach its former alignment in Claverack.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} and {{an adaptation of}} Washington Irving's story of Rip Van <b>Winkle.</b> The stage adaptation was well-known and the adaptation would be compared to Joseph Jefferson's portrayal on the stage.
