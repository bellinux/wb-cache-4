5|$|The aquarium's {{attempts}} to display captive <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> ended in 2011 {{due to the}} project's high resource intensity. Captive <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> also incurred injuries and killed other animals in the exhibit after becoming increasingly aggressive, and the final shark died due to unknown reasons following its release. Although no longer on exhibit for the public, aquarium scientists have continued to conduct research on <b>white</b> <b>sharks.</b> Collaborating with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in June 2016, aquarium scientists created cameras attached to harmless dorsal fin tags {{in an attempt to}} study the behavior of <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> during their gathering known as the White Shark Café.|$|E
5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. <b>White</b> <b>sharks</b> rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other <b>white</b> <b>sharks.</b> This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> bite to show their dominance.|$|E

5000|$|These {{sharks are}} {{possibly}} {{the ancestors of}} the Great <b>White</b> <b>Shark</b> (Carcharodon carcharias) and Megalodon (Carcharocles megalodon), as both these species have tooth serrations {{very similar to the}} serrations of Palaeocarcharodon. On the contrary Palaeocarcharodon has two cusps {{at the base of the}} main tooth, while the teeth of Great <b>White</b> <b>Shark</b> and Megalodon lack said small points. [...] Currently, Paleocarcharodon is viewed as a [...] "failed prototype" [...] of the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> that descended from Cretolamna and achieved its similarities to the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> (also a distant descendant of Cretolamna) as a result of convergent evolution.|$|R
5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> teeth. The great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|R

5|$|Great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> live {{in almost}} all coastal and {{offshore}} waters which have water temperature between , with greater concentrations in the United States (Northeast and California), South Africa, Japan, Oceania, Chile, and the Mediterranean including Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus. One of the densest known populations is found around Dyer Island, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.|$|E
5000|$|Stephan Swanson came to {{prominence}} as a marine researcher when he successfully placed the satellite transmitter on the famous Great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> Nicole, {{the first great}} <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> ever to be tracked on a 20,000 kilometer migration from South Africa to Australia and back. Due to his ability to handle large marine predators, such as the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> he was contracted as an expedition biologist to travel to Guadeloupe and place satellite transmitters on the dorsal fins of Great Whites. His historical capture and release of a 5m long, 1800 kilogram great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is documented in the National Geographic Marine Special [...] "Ultimate Shark".|$|R

5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for <b>white</b> <b>sharks.</b> They have been found with scars made by attacks from both <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|These {{observations}} {{argue against}} traditional theories that <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> are coastal territorial predators, {{and open up}} the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously {{thought to have been}} discrete. The reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include seasonal feeding or mating.|$|E

5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large prey animals. Great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> hunting strategies may {{be similar to}} how megalodon hunted its large prey.

5|$|In 2013, great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> {{were added}} to California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the {{population}} of great whites in the North Pacific {{was estimated to be}} fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{how much of a}} {{concurrent}} increase in fishing for great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2000 great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.|$|E

50|$|Fox is {{regarded}} as a world authority on the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> and has a great reputation as an expedition leader and producer of shark documentaries. He has been involved in some way with most great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> films made in the 20th century. He has hosted expeditions for over 100 major feature and documentary films with film makers and shark researchers from 16 different countries. Disney, Universal, IMAX, Cousteau Society and National Geographic have enlisted his help and have filmed and studied the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> from his cages.|$|R
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> in the Pliocene, may have also contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Great <b>white</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5000|$|Isurus hastalis or Carcharodon hastalis, the broad-tooth <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> is an extinct <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> {{that lived}} from the Eocene epoch to the Pleistocene epoch.

It {{is believed to}} be an ancestor to the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> a fact supported by the transitional species Carcharodon hubbelli, [...] and most likely would {{have been one of the}} top predators in its ecosystem; preying upon small whales and other mammals.|$|R
5|$|Prior to August 1981, {{no great}} <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> in captivity lived longer than 11 days.

40|$|The great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> Carcharodon carcharias, is {{the most}} widely {{protected}} elasmobranch in the world, and is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN and listed on Appendix III of CITES. Monitoring of trade in <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> products and enforcement of harvest and trade prohibitions is problematic, however, in large part due to difficulties in identifying marketed shark parts (e. g., dried fins, meat and processed carcasses) to species level. To address these conservation and management problems, we have developed a rapid, molecular diagnostic assay based on species-specific PCR primer design for accurate identification of <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> body parts, including dried fins. The assay is novel in several respects: It employs a multiplex PCR assay utilizing both nuclear (ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2) and mitochondrial (cytochrome b) loci simultaneously to achieve a highly robust measure of diagnostic accuracy; it is very sensitive, detecting the presence of <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> DNA {{in a mixture of}} genomic DNAs from up to ten different commercially fished shark species pooled together in a single PCR tube; and it successfully identifies <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> DNA from globally distributed animals. In addition to its utility for <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> trade monitoring and conservation applications, this highly streamlined, bi-organelle, multiplex PCR assay may prove useful as a general model for the design of genetic assays aimed at detecting body parts from other protected and threatened species...|$|R
5|$|On land, young sea otters {{may face}} attack from bears and coyotes. In California, bites from sharks, {{particularly}} great <b>white</b> <b>sharks,</b> have been estimated to cause 10% of sea otter deaths and {{are one of}} the reasons the population has not expanded further north. The great white shark is believed to be their primary predator, and dead sea otters have been found with injuries from shark bites, although there is no evidence that sharks actually eat them.|$|E
5|$|The California {{sea lion}} (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal eared seal native to western North America. It {{is one of}} six species of sea lion. Its natural habitat ranges from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. Sea lions feed {{on a number of}} species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and <b>white</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{conservation status}} of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction.
