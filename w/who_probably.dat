5|$|Prior to the game, Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen placed a partial-game {{suspension}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew, including leading rusher, Da'Rel Scott, and senior wide receiver Danny Oquendo.

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} game, Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed partial-game {{suspensions}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew. The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down wide receiver Danny Oquendo, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters. Consequently, {{a much younger}} line-up started for Maryland, including, according to Friedgen, some <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> would not have seen playing time otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The Pagan Empire {{disintegrated}} and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> {{preferred the}} situation, {{did nothing to}} restore order in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond {{the capital city of}} Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300–01.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} of Æthelstan {{took place}} on 4 September 925 at Kingston upon Thames, perhaps due to its symbolic location {{on the border between}} Wessex and Mercia. He was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Athelm, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> designed or organised a new ordo (religious order of service) in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet. The new ordo was influenced by West Frankish liturgy and in turn became one of the sources of the medieval French ordo.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his reign, Neferhotep I {{shared the}} throne with his brother Sihathor, a coregency that lasted a few months to a year. Sihathor died shortly before Neferhotep, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> then {{appointed}} another brother, Sobekhotep IV, as coregent. In any case, Sobekhotep IV succeeded Neferhotep I soon afterwards, and reigned over Egypt for almost a decade. The reigns of the two brothers mark the apex of the 13th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|George {{was born}} in the city of Hanover in Germany, and was the son of George Louis, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg (later King George I of Great Britain), and his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Celle. His sister, Sophia Dorothea, was born when he was three years old. Both of George's parents {{committed}} adultery, and in 1694 their marriage was dissolved on the pretext that Sophia had abandoned her husband. She was confined to Ahlden House and denied access to her two children, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> never saw their mother again.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} decades of the 10th century are an obscure period {{so far as the}} Hebrides are concerned. It is {{possible}} that Ragnall ua Ímair, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> ruled Mann during this period may have had some influence. However, Amlaíb Cuarán is the next King of the Isles on record. After the death of Amlaíb mac Gofraid in 941, Amlaíb Cuarán became King of Northumbria and probably succeeded his cousin Amlaíb as King of Mann. The former is recorded as being the Rex plurimarum insularum, suggesting he may have been the first King of both Mann and the Western Isles of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart of}} the Rashtrakuta empire {{included}} nearly all of Karnataka, Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh, an area which the Rashtrakutas ruled for over two centuries. The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that the feudatory King Dantidurga, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> ruled from Achalapura in Berar (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra), defeated the great Karnatic army (referring to {{the army of the}} Badami Chalukyas) of Kirtivarman II of Badami in 753 and took control of the northern regions of the Chalukya empire. He then helped his father-in-law, Pallava King Nandivarman regain Kanchi from the Chalukyas and defeated the Gurjaras of Malwa, and the rulers of Kalinga, Kosala and Srisailam.|$|E
5|$|The medieval era Jain logicians Akalanka and Vidyananda, {{who were}} likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, {{acknowledged}} many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his Pramanasamgraha acknowledges seven problems when anekantavada {{is applied to}} develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (vaiyadhi karanya), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence. Vidyananda acknowledged six {{of those in the}} Akalanka list, adding the problem of vyatikara (cross breeding in ideas) and apratipatti (incomprehensibility). Prabhācandra, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in anekantavada application.|$|E
5|$|Abu Firas further {{reports that}} Husayn {{was offered the}} {{governorship}} of Fars, but refused, and returned to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> still mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the Diyar Rabi'a, the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul. From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913/4. Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia. He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame. He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was ruled by a {{succession}} of seven kings. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, ruled in a tyrannical manner and, in 510 BC, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia, {{the wife of a}} senator named Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide because of the rape, and this led to a conspiracy which drove Tarquin from the city. With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive). While this story may be nothing more than a legend which later Romans created in order to explain their past, it is likely that Rome had been ruled by a series of kings, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> were, as the legends suggest, overthrown quickly.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries {{to run away from}} any danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises to the rank of brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book he estimates that he has had sex with 480 women.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Marion Archibald and Valerie Fenwick {{proposed}} an alternative hypothesis, {{based on the}} evidence of East Anglian coins and post-Conquest documents. Acknowledging that Beonna and Beornred were the same person, they suggested that after Ælfwald's death in 749, Æthelwald of Mercia installed Beornred/Beonna to rule northern East Anglia and Alberht (<b>who</b> <b>probably</b> belonged to the Wuffingas dynasty) to rule in the south. According to Archibald and Fenwick, after Æthelbald was murdered in 757, Beornred/Beonna became king of Mercia, during which his coinage was increased in East Anglia, perhaps to meet “military requirements”. Then, after a reign of only a few months, he was deposed by Offa and forced to flee from him back into East Anglia. Alberht, who had attempted to re-establish East Anglia as an independent kingdom and rule alone, and had succeeded for a short time, was deposed by Beornred/Beonna when he arrived as an exile in about 760. Soon afterwards, Offa asserted his authority over the East Angles in around 760-5 and removed Beonna.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Przemysł II {{concluded}} his first alliance with Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia. At first {{an ally of}} the Margraves of Brandenburg, Mestwin II could expel his brother and uncles from Pomerania and became sole ruler in 1271, but shortly after he was defeated and even imprisoned by them; this caused him to cede the province of Gdańsk to Margrave Conrad of Brandenburg in exchange for aid against his foes. Despite Mestwin II retaining the feudal sovereignty over the territory, the Brandenburg Margraviate still occupied the main castles and fortresses of the city even after the restoration of Mestwin II in the ducal throne. With his knowledge that his forces are too weak against Brandenburg, the Pomeranian Duke decided then to make an alliance with the Greater Poland rulers, Bolesław the Pious (<b>who</b> <b>probably</b> was his first-cousin) and Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|The Crow Green tannery was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, <b>who</b> <b>probably</b> purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|E
