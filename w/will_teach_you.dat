2500|$|Keble posed another question: [...] "What {{should be}} the tenor of their conduct, who find {{themselves}} cast on such times of decay and danger? How may a man best reconcile his allegiance to God and his Church with his duty to his country, that country, which now, by the supposition, is fast becoming hostile to the Church, and cannot therefore long be the friend of God?"

Samuel was publicly dismayed at the Israelites' conduct and although he obeyed God in letting the people make their own way he protested [...] "in the most distinct and solemn tone, so as to throw the whole blame of what might ensue on their wilfulness".

[...] The student asked to be excused from the {{compulsory}} gymnasium work, claiming it would be [...] "utterly impossible" [...] for him to participate. The student had never walked a step, his legs were twisted out of shape, {{and he could not}} control his head and neck. Fitzpatrick denied the request and promised the young man: [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> to walk." [...] Fitzpatrick invented exercises to strengthen every part of the student's body, until eventually the student could walk on his own. Fitzpatrick recalled:"Day after day I taught him. [...] I showed him how to step and helped him with my hands to take steps. The first two steps he took alone were followed by tears of joy. Of course, he'll never be able to walk as an able-bodied man, but he learned to discard his shuffle. ... This is but an instance of gymnasium work's benefits. If people realized the value of physical culture, we would be a splendidly developed race of men and women." ...|$|E
