500|$|Dylan {{finished}} the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray {{wrote that the}} album was: [...] "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s." [...] The track [...] "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while [...] "What <b>Was</b> <b>It</b> <b>You</b> Wanted?" [...] has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans. The religious imagery of [...] "Ring Them Bells" [...] struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.|$|E
500|$|For the exteriors of {{the capital}} city of King's Landing, that had been doubled for Malta for the entire season 1, now the {{production}} flew to the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Known as The Pearl of the Adriatic, the city proved to be a good representation of King's Landing since it shared many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, [...] "The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew that <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture." ...|$|E
60|$|Pala. So am I! quite thunder-struck. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you,</b> {{that called}} me within?--I must be impudent.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> mean, Dr Crofts? What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> saying? Why do {{you talk}} that nonsense, {{trying to see if}} you can provoke me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead?" [...] I {{remember}} whispering. [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> say?" [...] And I {{leaned forward}} towards him, peering into his face. [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> silly girl?" [...] said Mowbray, gently {{disengaging}} {{himself from}} her hold.--"What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> can {{have to ask}} that needs such a solemn preface?--Remember, I hate prefaces; and when I happen to open a book, always skip them." ...|$|R
60|$|Somebody told me you'd gone abroad. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you,</b> Dick? Dick is {{an admirable}} person, {{a sort of}} {{gazetteer}} for polite society.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you,</b> Selvagee! that, outward-bound, off Cape Horn, {{looked at}} Hermit Island through an opera-glass? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you,</b> who thought of proposing to the Captain that, when the sails were furled in a gale, {{a few drops}} of {{lavender}} should be dropped in their [...] "bunts," [...] so that when the canvas was set again, your nostrils might not be offended by its musty smell? I do not say it was you, Selvagee; I but deferentially inquire.|$|E
6000|$|Nasha {{smiled a}} little. [...] "We'll send {{you in the}} first party. Maybe you can discover--what <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> were so {{interested}} in?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> say I am, I <b>am</b> not. Whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> {{want from}} me, I will give. Whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> take from me, you can take. What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> {{can do to}} me? The {{worst thing you can}} do is kill me, after that I won't care, I am still free." ...|$|R
60|$|BURKE--[Impressed.] A governess, <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> <b>You</b> must <b>be</b> smart, surely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tito, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you,</b> I know," [...] said Romola, smiling brightly, {{and kissing}} him. [...] "How <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> never care about {{claiming}} anything? And after that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lawson {{sat down}} again. 'One must look after one's dog,' he said, {{with a note}} of apology. 'What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> were telling me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Rachel,--he isn't, is he--? I {{mean there}} isn't {{anything}} particular {{between him and}} you? How <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> were walking with him alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it, Sandy. But what <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> {{was saying}} about unsacrilegious things, which people expect to get, {{and will be}} {{disappointed}} about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It matters not {{how smart}} you are, [...] So <b>be</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> heedless too. [...] <b>It</b> isn't what <b>you</b> know that counts [...] So much as what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to <b>you.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Always have a leaning post - always! If {{you have}} no one to lean on, <b>you</b> have to <b>be</b> <b>IT.</b> And when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>IT,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> alone and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> tough.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{addressed}} {{a petition to}} my lord, in which, as I am informed, you express an opinion {{that you do not}} receive from Hiram's estate all that is your due." [...] Here most of the men expressed their assent. [...] "Now what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> ask for? What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> want that you hav'n't got here? What is it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So she does. She's fond of it,--I am not. I {{sometimes}} think that Fred takes after her. Where <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> first knew him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... --What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he {{was perhaps}} under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the latter portion. What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you...?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who did that?' he repeated. 'Show me {{the man who}} did it. Dog, <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you?</b> It {{was your}} deed, if not your hand--I know you.' ...|$|E
60|$|FTATATEETA (resolutely). So <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> {{shall not}} see my face until {{his eyes are}} darkened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's this? Aye, aye, mistress, <b>it's</b> <b>you,</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> <b>You</b> {{appear at}} a good time. I have just been hearing of you. Now! What do you want?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And now, tell {{me about}} your affairs, Francisco. Where <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> fell in with the Genoese galley, and by what miracle did you get off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! And it {{has come}} to that, has it? What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> said to Dr. O'Shaughnessey when we were off Point de Galle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{know you}} that, Seth Jepson, unless {{it be that}} you did play us false, and how <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> {{returned}} in company with the Britishers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What if <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>it's</b> <b>you!</b> And <b>it's</b> horrible, <b>you</b> {{wallowing in}} your own dead body, and {{thinking}} of eating it in the Sacrament." ...|$|R
60|$|Tim. Well, madam, what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> at? {{you shall}} find me {{reasonable}} to all your propositions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Does he?' {{she said}} at length, without expression. Then, rousing, 'And what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> don't want? You don't want marriage?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wetmore, what <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> saw in {{my picture}} today, when you began with that 'Hello' of yours, and then broke off to say {{something}} else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> saw him last?" [...] Scarborough {{asked the}} {{question}} with an abruptness which was predetermined, but which did not quite take Harry aback.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that's not logic--and I {{knew that}} before. It's really nothing, you know. What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>you</b> said to yourself? You {{certainly}} {{said more than}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. Robert, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not true, <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> {{not going}} to lend your support to this Argentine speculation? You couldn’t! ...|$|R
