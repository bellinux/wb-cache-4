5|$|Temporary repairs {{were made}} to the building. While it might have been salvageable, albeit with almost {{complete}} reconstruction, a decision was taken to build a new cathedral in a modern style instead, a step which had been contemplated even before the fire. Wren declared that it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> restore the old building.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved that it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Armoured Directorate of the Red Army (ABTU RKKA) {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a new conical turret for the T-26 similar to the BT-7's turret and to arm it with the 76.2mm L-10 tank gun. Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> implement this project because it would lead to a significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E

5|$|Study of {{the wreck}} {{also showed that}} {{restarting}} the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was then lost, it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> prevent the ship from sinking — her fate was more the result of design flaws than {{of the actions of}} her captain.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Council met at 10:30. Suzuki, who {{had just}} come from {{a meeting with the}} Emperor, said it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} the war. Tōgō Shigenori said that they could accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but they needed a guarantee of the Emperor's position. Navy Minister Yonai said that they had to make some diplomatic proposal—they could no longer afford to wait for better circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The only {{overlapping}} material between BMNH R3078 and the holotype of Cetiosauriscus leedsi is an ilium. However, in both specimens the ilium was {{preserved in}} insufficient ways. Since the only overlapping material <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> compare, Charig found that BMNH R3078 {{was of a}} different species and he named it Cetiosauriscus stewarti. Metacarpal 1 is short and massive, with the prominent process on {{the lower part of}} the posterior margin of the lateral face, a characteristic of the diplodocoids Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and Dicraeosaurus.|$|E

5|$|When first planned, the {{landings}} were to {{take place}} simultaneouslyOverlord in Normandy and Anvil {{in the south of}} France. It soon became clear that a dual landing <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> conduct with the available forces. The expansion of Overlord from a three- to a five-division front required many additional LSTs, which would have been needed for Anvil. At the same time, another Allied amphibious landing in Italy at Anzio had gone badly. All of these resulted in the postponing of Anvil by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated that it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. She noted that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition.|$|E
5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E

5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> replicate, {{in order to keep}} the film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A Little Bit of Heaven, Priest, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> apply {{some of the}} terms of the Act. Less {{eligibility}} was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Henry VI of England {{was less}} than a year old but his unclesled by Henry V's brother John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedfordcontinued the war. There were more victories, {{including}} the Battle of Verneuil, but it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> maintain campaigning at this level. Joan of Arc's involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans and win the Battle of Patay before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burned at the stake. The Dauphin was crowned and continued the successful Fabian tactics of avoiding full frontal assault and exploiting logistical advantage.|$|E

5|$|Next, Paramount {{sought to}} consult {{franchise}} creator Gene Roddenberry. He {{turned down the}} idea of running the show, given the time that production of The Original Series had distracted him from his family. But Paramount {{told him that it}} <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> pursue the new series otherwise, Roddenberry began to make plans for the series—with a new cast, as he wanted to avoid retreading and recreating the same roles now seen in the film franchise. Although they had not planned on it originally, Paramount hired Roddenberry to oversee the production and fired Strangis. However, one of his ideas appeared in the premise of The Next Generation, that the Federation and the Klingons had become allies. The first announcement of a new series was made by Roddenberry publicly on October 10, 1986.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December, the 16th Battalion Devonshire Regiment, 229th Brigade, 74th (Yeomanry) Division recaptured Beit Ur el Foqa. This {{infantry}} {{attack was}} launched {{from the head}} of the Wadi Zeit at 01:00, and by 03:30 the village had been captured, along with 17 prisoners and three machine guns. The position <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> hold, as it was overlooked by Ottoman positions on higher ground. Bombing and hand-to-hand fighting continued all morning, and the battalion withdrew, suffering 300 casualties. It has been claimed that on 3 December the Ottoman Army had abandoned their counterattacks and that fighting in the Judean Hills ceased.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> hide, {{and since it}} had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
40|$|In her article, Michaels (2000) defined {{action as}} "a {{temporally}} bounded, observable, goal-directed movement (or non-movement) that entails intention, {{the detection of}} information, and a lawful relation between that information and the movement" (p. 251). She defined perception as "the detection of information" (p. 244). This forces one to conclude that it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> study action separately from perception. We argue that perceptual judgments are communicated by movements and that it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> distinguish movements reporting perceptual judgments from other movements, so we conclude that the reverse also is true: It <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> study perception separately from action...|$|R
25|$|Some {{argue that}} it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> do the {{calculation}} that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect. Dennett points out that not only <b>is</b> it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> assign a precise utility value to the incident, it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests {{that it would have}} been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|R

5|$|The only warship {{reported}} wrecked on the Doom Bar was , a 12-gun schooner. The Whiting {{was originally}} a cargo ship named Arrow, which travelled from the United States to France; she {{was captured by}} the Royal Navy on 8 May 1812 and renamed. On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing and the wind was from an unfavourable direction offering little assistance. According to court-martial transcripts, an attempt to move her was made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> save her.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Tyre, on 27 July the crusaders {{decided to}} move to the plain on {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was less heavily {{fortified}} but had much less food and water. It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had by now arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> return to their better position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by Turkish archers who constantly harassed them.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E
