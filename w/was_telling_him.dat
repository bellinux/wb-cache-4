25|$|During his 7–8-month stint with James Finch, he {{finished}} third at Sonoma after leading a few laps {{and running in}} the top three all race long. However his nearest miss took place at Talladega that autumn. There Busch controlled the race early and mid-way and spun out from contact with Jamie McMurray. He was parked by NASCAR after driving away from the safety officials who were trying to assist him and he would not stop his car even though NASCAR <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> to do so. The following week he began driving for Furniture Row Racing.|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} really amazing quality in 'Paparazzi', where {{it kind of}} had this pure pop music quality {{but at the same}} time it was a {{commentary}} on fame culture... I wanted to do the same thing with this video... There certainly is a Tarantino-inspired quality in the [...] video... His direct involvement in [...] came from him lending me the Pussy Wagon. We were having lunch one day in Los Angeles and I <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> about my concept for the video and he loved it so much he said, [...] "You gotta use the Pussy Wagon." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 6, 2014, Big Sean {{released}} his verse {{for the song}} that was cut from the album version of the song. Detailing the song's recording process to MTV, Big Sean said, [...] "Me and [...] was in the studio working on {{a whole bunch of}} ideas and [...] came in the conversation. And everybody know Rick Ross albums is events. So Ye pulled a track up, and I <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> I think it's a banger, it's a smash, and he thought we should give it to Rozay.

500|$|Sweet began {{distancing}} {{himself from}} {{other people in the}} Athens music scene and in 1984 quit Oh-OK; by 1985, the Buzz of Delight had broken up. That year, Sweet got a record deal with CBS Records and moved to New York City. He was accused of being opportunistic and using his Athens connections to get a record deal and leave. Sweet maintains that when he went to CBS, he never claimed {{to have anything to do}} with Athens, so that nobody could say he used the town. He says that after months of living in Athens, he realized things weren't as happy there as everyone pretended, and that there was backstabbing going on. In 1993, he said, [...] "Things really turned dark there when R.E.M. got famous, because everyone wanted that fame so bad. Maybe I wanted it too, but I had this musical goal all of my own and wasn't going to go along with the way it was done there." [...] Everybody <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> that he should be touring and building up a following before doing his record, like R.E.M. had done. However, more than making the record itself and becoming a rock star, Sweet's main motivation was to get money to buy studio gear.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Marvel Comics {{announced}} that Kamala Khan, a teenage American Muslim from Jersey City, New Jersey, {{would take over}} the comic book series Ms. Marvel beginning in February 2014. The series, written by G. Willow Wilson and drawn by Adrian Alphona, {{marks the first time}} a Muslim character has headlined a book at Marvel Comics. However, Noelene Clark of the Los Angeles Times noted that Khan is not the first Muslim character in comic books, which include Simon Baz, Dust and M. The conception of Kamala Khan came about during a conversation between Marvel editors Sana Amanat and Stephen Wacker. Amanat said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> [...] some crazy anecdote about my childhood, growing up as a Muslim-American. He found it hilarious." [...] The pair then told Wilson about the concept and Wilson became eager to jump aboard the project. Amanat said that the series came from a [...] "desire to explore the Muslim-American diaspora from an authentic perspective." [...] Amanat stated that Khan's costume was influenced by the shalwar kameez. They wanted the costume to represent her cultural identity, but did not want her to wear a hijab. Amanat also stated that they wanted the character to look [...] "less like a sex siren" [...] to appeal to a more vocal female readership.|$|E
500|$|... "Master Teacher" [...] was {{conceived}} by Georgia Anne Muldrow on her Rhodes piano at Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio with Badu present and was originally intended {{for one of}} their albums. Its idyllic music blends mellow soul and glitchy hip hop, featuring a chopped sample of Curtis Mayfield's 1972 song [...] "Freddie's Dead". The song's lyrics envision {{a higher degree of}} African-American identity. Its vocalists ask in refrain, [...] "What if there was no niggas, only master teachers?", and answering [...] "I stay woke", with Badu responding [...] "I'm in the search of something new / Search inside me, searching inside you". Midway through the song, Poyser's keyboards lower the music's tempo, with a fluid, jazzy sound. [...] "That Hump" [...] concerns the topic of drug dependency. The closing track [...] "Telephone" [...] is a tribute to J Dilla, who died in 2006 from complications with blood disorder, and has themes of sorrow and hope. It serves as a departure from the preceding songs' edgier musical direction, featuring soft melodies and an acoustic feel similar to Badu's live sound. The song opens with the sound of ominous sirens, referencing J Dilla's 2006 album Donuts. The song's lyrics are based on a story told to Badu by J Dilla's mother on the day of his death. Poyser explained in an interview, [...] "Dilla's mom told Erykah about one day when he was telling her about this dream he had where Ol'Dirty <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> to get on a different color bus and giving him directions home". According to Poyser, the song's music was inspired by Dilla's passing: ...|$|E

500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him.</b> When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E
2500|$|Myrtle, {{also known}} as [...] "Myrt" [...] – an almost-never-heard-from {{telephone}} operator (she makes a brief appearance in the June 22, 1943 episode) that Fibber is friends with. A typical Myrt sketch started with Fibber {{picking up the phone}} and demanding, [...] "Operator, give me number 32Oooh, is that you, Myrt? How's every little thing, Myrt? What say, Myrt?" [...] Commonly, this was followed with Fibber relaying what Myrt <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> to Molly, usually news about Myrt's family, and always ending with a bad pun. Myrtle made one brief on-air appearance on June 22, 1943, when she visited the McGees to wish them a good summer—the McGees did not recognize her in person.|$|E

2500|$|Busch {{took over}} the No. 97 {{full-time}} in 2001, and ran for Rookie of the Year honors. After John Deere left the team, the No. 97 began the 2001 season unsponsored. After the team signed Rubbermaid to a multi-year contract later in the spring, Busch scored three Top 5's and six Top 10 finishes that year. He and Dale Earnhardt made contact in the 2001 Daytona 500 on lap 85. Earnhardt promptly flipped Busch the bird at 185mph or as described by lap-by-lap commentator Mike Joy in the Fox Sports booth, he simply <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> [...] "Kurt, you're number one." [...] To this day, Busch recalls this as {{the only time he}} encountered Earnhardt on the track (it was also the last time he and Earnhardt competed in the same race as a result of Earnhardt's fatal crash on the last lap). Busch finished with 27th in the point standings and runner-up for the Rookie of the Year honor's, and earned more than $2 million in winnings. Busch's best finish was third at the spring Talladega race, which was three weeks after scoring his first career Top 5 finish at Texas (fourth), and he added a fifth-place in the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. He also won the pole for the Southern 500 at Darlington, where he led 74 laps before a late-race brush with the wall took him to the garage. A month later, he led 38 laps at Martinsville before contact with Ricky Rudd cut his left-rear tire; heavy traffic behind him made matters worse, as Busch had to complete a lap and a half before he could get to the pits. During the delay, the tire carcass wrapped itself around the axle, costing him several laps. Overheating problems halted a strong performance at Rockingham in October, where he led 45 laps.|$|E
