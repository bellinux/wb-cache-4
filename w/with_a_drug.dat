5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> that {{effectively}} controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her. He takes {{her back to the}} suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as anoetic histamine. She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E

25|$|A {{forensic}} {{profile of}} the killer suggested {{that it would be}} a young man, in his mid- to late twenties, single, living either alone or with his mother. He would have been a loner, possibly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> problem, and may have been in psychiatric care at some point. He would also have had a history of anti-social behaviour and would be unlikely to have had any intimate relationships. The profile indicated a likelihood he would kill again.|$|E
25|$|Walgreens {{began in}} 1901, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> {{store on the}} corner of Bowen Ave and Cottage Grove in Chicago, owned by Galesburg native Charles R.

As a result of alcohol prohibition, the 1920s was a {{successful}} time for Walgreens. Although alcohol was illegal, prescription whiskey was available and sold by Walgreens.|$|E

Her parents divorced within a year of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, with help from an older sister, in Hollister and Warrenton. Connie Hedgepeth named her third daughter Faith because she believed that was what she needed to raise a third child when she already had two teenage daughters and a husband <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> problem.|$|E

25|$|In October 1989, Noriega foiled {{a second}} coup attempt {{by members of}} the Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF), led by Major Moisés Giroldi. Pressure mounted on Bush. Bush {{declared}} that the U.S. would not negotiate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> trafficker and denied knowledge of Noriega's involvement with the drug trade prior to his February 1988 indictment, although Bush had met with Noriega while Director of the CIA and had been the Chair of the Task Force on Drugs while Vice President. On 15 December, the Panamanian general assembly passed a resolution declaring that the actions of the United States had caused a state of war to exist between Panama and the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} {{focuses on the}} second half of the characters' junior year and sets aside {{basketball}} and explores new romances. Lucas dates Anna Taggaro, Jake Jagielski dates Peyton, and there is a love triangle between Felix Taggaro, Brooke and Mouth McFadden. This season also shows the disintegration of Nathan and Haley's relationship because of Chris Keller, and the repercussions– especially for Lucas– of Dan's hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an inherited disease. Peyton deals with drug problems and the return of her biological mother and Karen starts the Tric club and begins a relationship with her school teacher Andy Hargrove. A troubled Deb struggles <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> addiction.|$|E
25|$|Coming off a fifth-place {{finish in}} head coach Bill Belichick's first season in 2000, the Patriots were not {{expected}} to fare much better in 2001. While Drew Bledsoe was signed to a 10-year contract extension in March, offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong retired, and wide receiver Terry Glenn had a preseason contract holdout and was also hit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> suspension by the NFL {{for the first four}} games of the season. Despite these high-profile losses, the Patriots were able to find adequate replacements at very low cost. Receivers Troy Brown and David Patten had career seasons, 1st-round draft pick Richard Seymour anchored the defensive line, and Antowain Smith (a free agent signed from Buffalo) ran for over 1,000 yards.|$|E

25|$|The rumor {{once again}} spread in October 1998, {{when a new}} fax, this time {{claiming}} to originate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Drug</b> Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) officer in Texas. The rumor spread further when officials in the San Diego government circulated the fax among city agencies; {{this version of the}} fax, though quickly dismissed within city government when {{it was found that the}} Sheriff's office had no real connection to it, now appeared to be a legitimate government-issued document. Also in the fall of 1998, the Sheriff's office of Nassau County, Florida sent a warning about such gang initiation to the county fire department, who subsequently spread the fax to all county agencies. Police dispatcher Ann Johnson had thought the message urgent enough to send, but had not bothered to check its legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|The seventh season jumps {{fourteen}} months ahead. Rachel {{returns and}} two new regular characters are introduced: Haley's sister Quinn and Nathan's agent Clay. Lucas and Peyton have moved away, Quinn and Clay's relationship develops {{after the death}} of Clay's wife Sarah. Nathan's NBA career is jeopardized by a growing scandal that also affects Haley. Dan becomes a motivational speaker with the support of his new wife, Rachel Gatina. Brooke releases her new clothing line in the midst of conflicts with Julian and Alex, a model she hired for her company. Millicent struggles <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> addiction which causes Mouth to break it off with her. The {{second half of the season}} deals with Haley's depression due to her mother's death. At the end of the season, the characters travel to Utah for the premiere of Julian's completed film, Haley announces she's pregnant, Julian proposes to Brooke, and Clay and Quinn are shot by Katie.|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) {{has been known for}} a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E

While there, Rashad catches the eye of New-New (Lauren London), a round-the-way girl with a mysterious background, since he only sees her around when she is hanging out with her friends Veda (Khadijah Haqq) and Star (Malika Haqq). The two become {{attracted}} {{to one another and}} they later kiss when he gives her a ride home in his Chevrolet El Camino. However, in contrast, Esquire instantly develops a disliking for Rashad's new love interest, considering her bad company. Meanwhile, no longer under Rashad's watchful eyes, Ant becomes involved <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> dealer named Marcus (Patton) and begins to sell for him.

The drug runner agrees, but is killed after telling that he believed Eko had no soul. Later, Eko visits the church of his hometown, where Yemi {{has become a}} priest. Eko asks him for a plane, because only United Nations relief and missionary aircraft are allowed to fly out of Nigeria, saying he will fly the drugs away from the Nigerians and give his brother money for a polio vaccine. Yemi refuses to help. Later, Eko approaches his brother again, asking simply for Yemi to sign ordination papers that make Eko and two associates priests so that they can arrange the flight themselves. His brother refuses, but reluctantly signs after Eko says that his two friends will burn the church to the ground if Yemi does not collaborate. Eko also buys Virgin Mary statues to hide the heroin within.|$|E
