50|$|Blind spots {{may occur}} {{in the front of}} the driver when the A-pillar (also called the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillar),</b> side-view mirror, or {{interior}} rear-view mirror block a driver's view of the road. Behind the driver, cargo, headrests, and additional pillars may reduce visibility.|$|E
50|$|The 1975 {{models were}} {{virtually}} {{identical to the}} 1974s, except for a new grille and that California and some high-altitude models were equipped with catalytic converters and so required unleaded gasoline. All 1975 models were required to pass a roof crush test and to meet this stringent requirement, additional reinforcements were added to all Dart 2-door hardtops. Heavy gauge steel in the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillar</b> area had been incorporated into the <b>windshield,</b> <b>pillar</b> and roof design. Darts were also equipped with an improved energy absorbing steering column which used multiple slots in the column jacket to replace prior used convoluted mesh design. At impact, force applied to the steering wheel curled the column jacket back over a mandrel mounted on the floor. Federal Motor Safety Standards briefly required that the front seat belts include a starter interlock system that prevented the engine from starting unless the front seat outboard occupant and the driver fastened their belts.|$|E
50|$|The Impala was {{introduced}} for the 1958 model year as {{top of the}} line Bel Air hardtops and convertibles. From the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillar</b> rearward, the 1958 Bel Air Impala differed structurally from the lower-priced Chevrolet models. Hardtops had a slightly shorter greenhouse and longer rear deck. The wheelbase of the Impala was longer than the lower priced models, although the overall length was identical. Interiors held a two-spoke steering wheel and color-keyed door panels with brushed aluminum trim. No other series included a convertible.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{collisions}} between motor vehicles and moose is increasing in many countries. Collisions with large, high {{animals such as}} moose cause typical rear- and downward deformation of the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> and front roof, most pronounced for small passenger cars; the injury risk increases with the deformation of the car. A strengthening of the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> and front roof {{and the use of}} antilacerative windshields would reduce the injury risk to car occupants...|$|R
50|$|Canopy - in this style, {{the vinyl}} {{covering}} is {{applied only to}} the front half or {{two thirds of the}} roof, usually ending at the trailing edge of the rear side windows. The <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> are very commonly covered in this style, but the C pillars never are.|$|R
50|$|Full - this is {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen style, in which the vinyl simply covers the whole top of the car, including the C <b>pillars.</b> The <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> {{may or may not be}} covered. If a center sedan pillar exists, it is usually not covered, but exceptions to this rule were made. This is the type that was almost always used on four-door models.|$|R
2500|$|The Concorde was {{completely}} redesigned for the 1998 model year. The [...] "Second Generation" [...] design {{was introduced in}} 1996 as the Chrysler LHX concept car. This concept vehicle had large, 20-inch wheels, a centrally located instrument cluster, and a closed-circuit television system within the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> replacing conventional rear view mirrors.. The wheelbase was expanded to [...] to allow for rear passenger supplement restraints, rear occupant entertainment center and storage compartment.|$|R
50|$|What did {{apply to}} all American cars in 1967 {{was the use of}} a dual-circuit braking system with a dual-chambered master cylinder. Increased {{awareness}} of passenger safety resulted in such innovations as safety-padded <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> and an unusual 1967-only safety pad which protruded {{from the center of the}} three-spoked steering wheel to a point just beyond the rim of the steering wheel. It was designed to minimize abdominal injuries in the event of a collision.|$|R

5000|$|The 1956 F-100 is {{a one-year}} only body style. The 1956 F-100 is easily {{identified}} {{as it has}} vertical <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> and a wrap around windshield {{as opposed to the}} sloped <b>pillars</b> and angled <b>windshield</b> of the 1953-55. The 1956 model also offered a larger wraparound back window as an option. Starting in 1956, Ford offered the very rare [...] "Low GVWR" [...] versions of each model. Also in 1956, seat belts became an option.|$|R
500|$|The Aston Martin DB9 Volante is the {{convertible}} {{version of the}} DB9 coupe. The chassis, though stiffer, uses the same base VH platform. To protect occupants from rollovers, the Volante has strengthened the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> and added two pop-up hoops behind the rear seats. The hoops cannot be disabled and will break the car's rear window if deployed. In an effort to improve the Volante's ride while cruising, Aston Martin have softened the springs and lightened the anti-roll bars in the Volante, leading to a gentler suspension. The retractable roof of the Volante is made of folding fabric and takes 17 seconds to be put up or down. The Volante weighs [...] more than the coupe.|$|R
5000|$|Ford in {{the late}} 1970s {{installed}} both the [...] "landau and canopy" [...] styles on one vehicle. On vinyl-equipped 1977-79 Thunderbirds, two separate vinyl areas existed, one starting {{at the base of}} the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> and extending back to the trailing edge of the front side windows, and another starting {{at the base of the}} rear window and coming forward as far as the leading edge of the rear side window. These were separated by a targa band of sheet metal in the middle of the roof, which swept down at the sides to form a thick sedan-like pillar on the sides. It was an updated appearance from the 1955 Ford Crown Victoria [...] "basket handle".|$|R
5000|$|The 1973 Chevelle Laguna [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop {{featured}} a semi-fastback roofline with styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, frameless door glass and distinctive rear quarter glass on two-door coupes. New side windows with styled center pillars were featured on four-door sedan models. The new-design B pillars were structurally {{strong enough to}} contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. GM had anticipated federal roll-over safety standards for January 1974 that did not materialize. The unusually thin <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> contributed to the much improved visibility over the previous generation Chevelles. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate. The wagons, available in six or nine passenger seating, {{featured a}} counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easy entry and loading up to [...]|$|R
2500|$|Another {{structural}} improvement was a stronger {{design for the}} side door guard beams. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) for coupes and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels (which was also optional with the Monte Carlo), as was the instrument gauge cluster. A power moonroof was an option 1973-75. Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the rear. Headroom was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by [...] Rear seat legroom was up [...] in sedans. Another was a [...] luggage capacity, an increase of [...] over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The unusually thin <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> also contributed to much better visibility.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 Buick's popular Super {{continued}} {{to combine the}} large C-body interior expanse with medium bracket interiors and performance. Supers had four of the new round VentiPorts per fender this year, with additional series script found on rear quarters and within the deck emblem. The side Sweepspear was unchanged from 1954. The larger bodied Buicks were readily identified by their more rounded contours, straight up <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> and sedan rear quarter windows. Series 50 Super and 70 Roadmaster headlamp bezels also housed parking lights. Inside, a new Red Liner speedometer lay horizontally across the instrument panel. Interiors were trimmed in nylon/Cordaveen combinations, except for the convertible which featured leather seats. Standard Super equipment included trip mileage indicator, electric clock and, on convertibles, a power horizontal seat adjuster. Super sales rose to 132,463.|$|R
50|$|Using the new larger General Motors C-body, with {{vertical}} <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> {{and the new}} Panoramic windshield, the Super for 1954 was a big Buick for {{the budget}} minded buyer. Identified by its three VentiPorts per fender, the Super script on the quarters and the series designation within the deck ornament, the Super shared other brightwork with the Roadmaster. Interiors were nylon and were plainer than in the Roadmaster. The Super did have the more expensive car's horizontal speedometer instrument panel. The convertible was upholstered in leather and had power-operated windows, seat and top, along with an outside rearview mirror on the left, as standard equipment. New features included a lighted ignition key slot, electric windows, and a roof rail cover. The Estate wagon was discontinued. Total sales fell to 118,630.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973 models also {{introduced}} molded full foam {{front and rear}} seat construction, a flow-through power ventilation system, an inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and [...] "flush and dry" [...] rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets.Another structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) for coupes and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster. A power moonroof was an option 1973-75. Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the rear. Headroom was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by 1.6 in. Rear seat legroom was up 3.5 in in sedans. Another was a 15.3 cuft L luggage capacity, an increase of 2.5 cuft L over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans.

40|$|Injuries {{related to}} snowmobiles, {{motorcycles}} and moose-car collisions have increased. The {{aim of the}} present thesis was to analyse mechanisms and consequences in fatal and non-fatal accidents of these types, and to penetrate possible preventive measures. Snowmobiles The median age of the injured was 30 and of the killed 32, males pre­dominating. A majority of the accidents occurred during weekends, and especially the fatal accidents occurred after dark. The extremities were the most commonly injured parts of the body, however, drowning, crushed chest and cranial injuries caused most of the fatalities. Among the fatalities, {{four out of five}} were under the influence of alcohol. The present Swedish laws regarding snowmobiles seem well motivated. "Built-in" safety measures {{in the construction of the}} snowmobiles, pro­perly designed snowmobile tracks and functional search and rescue sys­tems could reduce the injuries. Motorcycles The median age was 19 years for both the traffic injured and the kil­led. Half of the traffic accidents were collisions with other motor ve­hicles. In the fatally injured group, also collisions with fixed road­side objects were common. Of the fatally injured, more than every fifth person died in an accident where alcohol was an influential factor. In the injured group, lower extremity injuries (especially in off-road riding) were common and among the fatalities most riders died from injuries to the head or chest. Out of one thousand motorcycle riders interviewed, 45 % reported wobbling experiences (8 % reported severe wobbling). Possible injury reducing measures include increasing the licensing age, more discriminating driving test, "built-in" restriction of the motorcycle's top speed, elimination of motorcycles prone to wobbling, and a more intensive traffic supervision (speeding, alco­hol). Moose-car collisitions The median age of the drivers was 38 years. Most collisions happened at dusk or when dark (3 / 4). The median collision speed was 70 km/h. The damage to the car was typical, the roof and the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> were deformed downwards and backwards. The broken windshield was often pressed into the passenger compartment. Most of the injured car occu­pants suffered cuts predominantly to the head and upper extremities. Nearly all the fatally injured died of head and neck injuries. The injuries may be reduced by strengthening the roof and the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars,</b> and by introducing anti 1 acerati ve windshields. Diss.

5000|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies with 1 {{in a wider}} wheel track, front and rear. The left wheel was {{adjusted}} to have slightly more positive camber than the right, {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 El Caminos. Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style outside door handles, molded full-foam seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger [...] fuel tank, and [...] "flush and dry" [...] rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster. A benefit of the new body designs was much better visibility of which the unusually thin <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> contributed. A structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. El Caminos shared the [...] "Colonnade" [...] frameless door glass with other Chevelles, and would continue this feature into the next generation as well.|$|R
50|$|The hood of most {{vehicles}} {{is usually}} fabricated from sheet metal, {{which is a}} compliant energy absorbing structure and thus poses a comparatively small threat. Most serious head injuries occur when there is insufficient clearance between the hood and the stiff underlying engine components. A gap of approximately 10 cm is usually enough to allow the pedestrian’s head to have a controlled deceleration and a significantly reduced risk of death. Creating room under the hood {{is not always easy}} because usually there are other design constraints, such as aerodynamics and styling. In some regions of the hood it can be impossible. These include along the edges on which the hood is mounted and the cowl, where the hood meets the windshield. Engineers have attempted to overcome this problem by using deformable mounts, and by developing more ambitious solutions such as airbags that are activated during the crash and cover the stiff regions of the hood. Some models, like the Citroën C6 and Jaguar XK feature a novel pop-up bonnet design, which adds 6.5 cm (2.5", C6) extra clearance over the engine block if the bumper senses a hit. In 2012 and 2015, the Volvo V40 and the Land Rover Discovery Sport have an under-the hood airbag which operates if the hood senses a hit. The airbag also covers the <b>windshield</b> <b>pillars</b> to provide better protection in all areas struck by the pedestrian's head.|$|R
5000|$|More than 270 000 {{pedestrians}} {{lose their}} lives on the world’s roads each year accounting for 22% of the total 1.24 million road traffic deaths [...] Despite the magnitude of the problem, most attempts at reducing pedestrian deaths had historically focused solely on education and traffic regulation. Since the 1990s, crash engineers have begun to use design principles that have proved successful in protecting car occupants to develop vehicle design concepts that reduce the likelihood of injuries to pedestrians {{in the event of a}} car-pedestrian crash. These involve redesigning the bumper, hood (bonnet), and the <b>windshield</b> and <b>pillar</b> to be energy absorbing (softer) without compromising the structural integrity of the car.|$|R
5000|$|An {{extremely}} dangerous situation occurs during [...] "underride collisions", {{in which a}} passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a rear underride guard, or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a side underride guard. [...] The platform bed of a typical trailer is approximately at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means that {{there may not be}} much between a head and the edge of the trailer platform, except a glass windshield. [...] In an underride collision, the car's crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed, and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the <b>windshield</b> and roof <b>pillars</b> have already impacted the trailer bed. [...] Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space, leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low speed collisions. Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards, which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.|$|R
