He developed the concept that is today known as a normal subgroup. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a proper decomposition if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup. He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.|$|E
25|$|Among the Horseman's <b>Word</b> <b>group</b> in Angus, {{initiation}} ceremonies typically {{took place}} at night, preferably {{at the time of}} the full moon, in an isolated barn, byre, stable, or steading. An individual known as the High Horseman would be seated in this space, holding a cloven goat's hoof in his hand; he would preside over the ceremony. The apprentice was then stripped to the waste and blindfolded, and spun around by his fellows in order to disorient him before being brought into the ceremonial space and made to stand before the High Horseman. The High Horseman asked a series of set questions of his fellows at which they responded with a series of set answers. Turning to the initiate, who I made to kneel and has his blindfold removed, the High Horseman then commanded the newcomer to provide vows to keep to the group's secrets. This achieved, all those assembled then recited the Horseman's Creed, which reminded them of the punishments that should befall them should they break their vows. Following the ceremony, a ceilidh was held in which toasts were made and the assembled horsemen drank from whisky that the apprentice had been required to bring with him.|$|E

5000|$|Repentance is a {{stage in}} Christian {{salvation}} where the believer turns away from sin. As a distinct stage in the ordo salutis its position is disputed, with some theological traditions arguing it occurs prior to faith and the Reformed theological tradition arguing it occurs after faith. [...] In Roman Catholic theology repentance {{is part of the}} larger theological concept of penance. [...] Generally in the Old Testament the term repentance comes from the Hebrew <b>word</b> <b>group</b> that means [...] "turn away from". Sometimes this <b>word</b> <b>group</b> is employed to request a turning from sinful activity (Jeremiah 8:6). In the New Testament the μετανοέω/metanoeo <b>word</b> <b>group</b> can mean remorse but is generally translated as a turning away from sin (Matthew 3:2). Theologically 'repentance', the turning away from sin is linked to a corresponding turn to faith in God.|$|E

Written language is usually expressed through writing. The teaching of English in Widya Mandala University covers four language skills. They are listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Among the four language skills, writing is considered {{as one of the most}} difficult language skills. Writing is thinking on paper which is usually in the form of paragraphs. The combination of several paragraphs is called a composition. The clarity in the paragraph and composition can be achieved by using one of the cohesive devices - that is conjunctions. In this study, the writer focuses her attention on the conjunctions used in the students' compositions. Realizing that conjunctions are broad enough, she deals with the use of conjunctions that join grammatically equal <b>words</b> or <b>word</b> <b>groups.</b> What types of conjunctions that join grammatically equal <b>words</b> or <b>word</b> <b>groups</b> are most frequently used by the students in their compositions?
