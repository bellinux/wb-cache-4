After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda, schools were closed in preparation for Carrie, while vessels were <b>warned</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oncoming hurricane. Most planes in Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated, with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags.
