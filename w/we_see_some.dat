500|$|During an {{interview}} with Marion McMullen from the Coventry Evening Telegraph, Davies explained that the Gothic elements to the novel gave him inspiration to add dream sequences and fantasies to the script. He told McMullen, [...] "I've been very faithful to the book, {{but one of the}} differences has been writing the scenes showing Catherine's fantasies. Catherine is a great reader of horror fiction – the gothic novel was fairly popular in those days, like a young girl today who would read a lot of rather steamy romances. In this production, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of Catherine's fantasies, some of which are quite steamy for a young girl." [...] Davies admitted that he was proud of his reputation for [...] "sexing up" [...] the novels he had adapted and commented that none of his scenes were gratuitous. He told McMullen that he often looked for excuses to get the characters out of their clothes, as he felt they were always being [...] "buttoned up to the neck". Producer Keith Thompson said Davies had made Northanger Abbey a bit more erotic than the novel and thought the script had [...] "a wonderful cheekiness to it." [...] Davies chose to use a narrator to speak Austen's words and help set the scene {{at the beginning and end}} of the film.|$|E

When Lynsey manages to escape from Silas, he follows her and confuses Heidi with Lynsey as they are wearing identical Catwoman costumes. Silas hits Heidi, who he mistakes for Lynsey, {{over the head with}} a brick, before strangling her to death. Silas is devastated when he realises that he has killed Heidi. The Daily Star had previously reported that Silas would kill Heidi, but this was not confirmed by Hollyoaks producers. Tiddy called the storyline [...] "fantastic" [...] and said the twist of Silas killing Heidi was [...] "great". Tiddy opined that Heidi's death would affect Silas, saying [...] "I think we'll see some remorse from him, as killing Heidi was a genuine mistake, and that's what is so great about the storyline.

2500|$|The {{character}} Kent Brockman {{functions as}} The Simpsonss main character for news parodies. He {{was based on}} Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy, and modeled after anchorman Ted Koppel. Another influence on the character was The Mary Tyler Moore Shows Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. His role on The Simpsons is to host the news as the fictional television channel, Channel 6's anchorman. In addition to the news, he also hosts the programs Eye on Springfield and Smartline. In most of his appearances, he seems more interested in entertaining the viewers than informing them of real news. In [...] "Homer Loves Flanders" [...] Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory" [...] in a news broadcast. Mirkin {{said this was a}} joke the staff [...] "particularly loved to do" [...] because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly [...] "always trying to scare everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression. Turner said that [...] "in Brockman's journalism, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the modern news media's ugliest biases", of which he says are glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors. Brockman is joined by Scott Christian and Arnie Pie on the Channel 6 news team. Originally, Scott Christian was the anchor and Brockman was the field reporter, but the show shifted focus to Brockman. Arnie Pie is a helicopter-based traffic reporter that sometimes help with field reports other than traffic.|$|E

While EMP Pad Limited said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the company's owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter. Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that [...] "the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer" [...] and that [...] "no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machines – or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses – have any benefit for cancer patients. Nor have organisations that scrutinise new treatments and devices (like the US Food and Drug Authority or the European Medicines Agency) approved any as a therapy for any type of disease". Dr David Grimes, a cancer researcher at Oxford University, told ‘This Morning’: [...] "It’s not just untrue, it’s patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it’s not because they are negative". Prof. John Gribben, Chair of Medical Oncology at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches". Prof. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University Of Exeter said “The reason why most of us put ‘negative energy’ in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not be so bad except that, as <b>we</b> <b>see,</b> <b>some</b> VIPs seem to take this nonsense seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.” ...|$|E

60|$|The {{remarkable}} fact is, however, and {{it bears}} strongly {{on the present}} position of Byron, that when a thing is unfamiliar to us, when it is remote and the product of some other age or spirit, we think it not savage or terrible, but merely artificial. There are many instances of this: a fair one {{is the case of}} tropical plants and birds. When <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the monstrous and flamboyant blossoms that enrich the equatorial woods, we do not feel that they are conflagrations of nature; silent explosions of her frightful energy. We simply {{find it hard to believe}} that they are not wax flowers grown under a glass case. When <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the tropic birds, with their tiny bodies attached to gigantic beaks, we do not feel that they are freaks of the fierce humour of Creation. We almost believe that they are toys out of a child's play-box, artificially carved and artificially coloured. So it is with the great convulsion of Nature which was known as Byronism. The volcano is not an extinct volcano now; it is the dead stick of a rocket. It is the remains not of a natural but of an artificial fire.|$|E

'Seeing {{the ease}} and {{security}} in which these people were living, I felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for {{the strength of a}} man and the softness of a woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less necessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family, and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their children's needs disappears. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this future age it was complete.

60|$|But {{all such}} trades {{as can be}} {{rendered}} decent the aristocracy has adopted one by one.
