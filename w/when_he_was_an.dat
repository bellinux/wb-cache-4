5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> active member of the security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but most of the time he feels more like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E

Around the same time he developed a list of requirements for his future wife, that she should be subservient and pure but also able to discuss philosophy and live without frivolities. These high standards, combined with his generally unlikeable personality, meant that his advances were rejected by several women while he was at university.|$|E

25|$|Twain's next venture was {{a work of}} {{straight}} fiction that he called Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc and dedicated to his wife.

25|$|Here, the Court of Appeals, though {{correctly}} {{holding that}} respondent proved a prima facie case, erred in holding that petitioner had not discharged its {{burden of proof}} in rebuttal by showing that its stated reason for the rehiring refusal was based on respondent's illegal activity.

Other evidence that may be relevant, depending on the circumstances, could include facts that petitioner had discriminated against respondent <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> employee or followed a discriminatory policy toward minority employees.|$|E
