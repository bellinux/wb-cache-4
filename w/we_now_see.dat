5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>see</b> {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E

25|$|The {{ceremonial}} centers {{were always}} built to be visible. The pyramids {{were meant to}} {{stand out from the}} rest of the city, to represent its gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All of the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on top of the other, to the point that what <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>see</b> is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters. Stelae were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.|$|E

500|$|As Jon Mee, {{a scholar}} of British radicalism, writes: [...] "Paine {{believed}} [...] [...] [...] a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution." [...] Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, [...] "an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions." [...] It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's [...] "secular millennialism" [...] and it appears {{in all of his}} works—he ends the Rights of Man, for example, with the statement: [...] "From what <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>see,</b> nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, in which everything may be looked for." [...] Paine [...] "transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia," [...] emphasizing the possibilities of [...] "progress" [...] and [...] "human perfectibility" [...] that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the above}} theory is true, {{the next stage}} of {{development}} ought to be triple algebra and if [...] truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was [...] although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that [...] De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>see</b> the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is why it {{has been found to be}} the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that “double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests”.|$|E
