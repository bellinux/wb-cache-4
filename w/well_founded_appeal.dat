Thus the <b>Well</b> <b>Founded</b> model may be accepted as a partially definite view of the world, and the other extended stable models as alternative extended consistent views of the world. The original contributions of this paper are: showing that <b>Well</b> <b>Founded</b> Semantics is useful for representing hypothetical reasoning problems; to present a framework for representing always within the language itself: definite, default and generally applicable rules; preference among defaults; exceptions to rules; exceptions to exceptions; abduction; and integrity constraints...|$|R

5000|$|The {{assumption}} that {{there exists a}} standard model of ZFC (in a given universe) is stronger than the {{assumption that}} there exists a model. In fact, {{if there is a}} standard model, then there is a smallest standard model called the minimal model contained in all standard models. The minimal model contains no standard model (as it is minimal) but (assuming the consistency of ZFC) it containssome model of ZFC by the Gödel completeness theorem. This model is necessarily not <b>well</b> <b>founded</b> otherwise its Mostowski collapse would be a standard model. (It is not <b>well</b> <b>founded</b> as a relation in the universe, though itsatisfies the axiom of foundation so is [...] "internally" [...] <b>well</b> <b>founded.</b> Being <b>well</b> <b>founded</b> is not an absolute property.)In particular in the minimal model there is a model of ZFC but there is no standard model of ZFC.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{logarithmic}} {{number system}} (LNS) has <b>found</b> <b>appeal</b> in digital arithmetic {{because it allows}} multiplication and division to be performed much faster and more accurately than with the widely used floating-point (FP) number formats. We review the sign/logarithmic number system and present a comparison of various techniques and architectures for performing arithmetic operations efficiently in LNS. As a case study, we describe the European logarithmic microprocessor, a device built {{in the framework of}} a research project launched in 1999. Comparison of the arithmetic performance of this microprocessor with that of a commercial superscalar pipelined FP processor leads to the conclusion that LNS can be successfully deployed in general-purpose systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} implementations of <b>Well</b> <b>Founded</b> Semantics restrict or forbid the use {{of variables}} when using negative queries, something which is essential for using logic programming as a programming language. We present a procedure to obtain results under the <b>Well</b> <b>Founded</b> Semantics that removes this constraint by combining two techniques: the transformation presented in [MMNMH 08] to obtain from a program its dual and the derivation procedure presented in [PAP + 91] {{to determine if a}} query belongs or not to the <b>Well</b> <b>Founded</b> Model of a program. Some problems arise during their combination, mainly due to the original environment for which each one was designed: results obtained in the first one obey a variant of Kunen Semantics and non-ground programs are not allowed (or previously grounded) in the second one. Most of these problems were solved by using abductive techniques, which lead us to observe that the existing implementations of abduction in logic programming disallow {{the use of}} variables. The reason for that is the impossibility to evaluate non-ground queries, so it seemed interesting to develop an abductive framework making use of our negation system. Both goals are achieved in this thesis: the capability of solving non-ground queries under <b>Well</b> <b>Founded</b> Semantics and the use of variables in abductive logic programming. page 1 T...|$|R

Still <b>found</b> <b>appeal</b> {{in the relatively}} tame side effects of those modalities, and imagined that someday [...] "rational medical therapy" [...] would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, surgery and very sparing use of drugs, including anesthetics, antiseptics and antidotes. He invented the name osteopathy by blending two Greek roots osteon- for bone and -pathos for suffering in order to communicate his theory that disease and physiologic dysfunction were etiologically grounded in a disordered musculoskeletal system. Thus, by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system, he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side-effects of drugs.|$|R
