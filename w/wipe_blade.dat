6000|$|... "There {{are more}} {{pressing}} matters to demand Your Majesty's attention," [...] said Mr. Wilding coldly, {{advancing to the}} table as he spoke, and taking up a napkin to <b>wipe</b> his <b>blade,</b> [...] "than the reward of an unworthy servant." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{three minutes}} {{it was all}} over and Sir Oliver was {{carefully}} <b>wiping</b> his <b>blade,</b> whilst Sir John lay coughing upon the turf tended by white-faced Peter Godolphin and a scared groom who had been bidden thither to make up the necessary tale of witnesses.|$|R
5000|$|... 1927: Visionall® Wiper System. Two {{blade wiper}} system (a four blade system was also offered) where the <b>blades</b> <b>wiped</b> {{directly}} sideways.|$|R
60|$|A little shudder {{passed through}} the wide-eyed guests. Some one broke into hysterical laughter, a woman sobbed, and then Norman of Torn, <b>wiping</b> his <b>blade</b> upon the rushes of the floor {{as he had done}} upon another {{occasion}} in that same hall, spoke quietly to the master of Leybourn.|$|R
5000|$|... 1953: “Arctic” Winter Blade. The {{precursor}} to today’s premium winter blade, it was {{encased in a}} flexible ice-repellent hood that de-iced itself as the <b>blade</b> <b>wiped.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rotating, plate DSSHEs. The <b>blades</b> <b>wipe</b> the {{external}} surface of circular plates arranged in series inside a shell. The heating/cooling fluid runs inside the plates. The frequency is about several dozen rpm. An {{example is the}} HRS Spiratube T-Sensation.|$|R
60|$|A dozen {{sprang to}} his aid, {{foremost}} amongst them being St. Auban and Montmédy, whilst I drew back, suddenly realising my own spent condition, {{to which the}} heat of the combat had hitherto rendered me insensible. I mastered myself as best I might, and, dissembling my hard breathing, I <b>wiped</b> my <b>blade</b> with a kerchief, an act which looked so calm and callous that it drew from the crowd--for a crowd it had become by then--an angry growl. 'T is thus with the vulgar; they are ever ready to sympathise with the vanquished without ever pausing to ask themselves if his chastisement may not be merited.|$|R
60|$|Lan-O saw {{the woman}} from Helium half turn, and with a quick {{movement}} jerk her right hand from where it had lain upon her breast. She saw the hand shoot from beneath the arm of E-Med and rise behind his shoulder and she saw in the hand a long, slim blade. The lips of the warrior were drawing closer {{to those of the}} woman, but they never touched them, for suddenly the man straightened, stiffly, a shriek upon his lips, and then he crumpled like an empty fur and lay, a shrunken heap, upon the floor. Tara of Helium stooped and <b>wiped</b> her <b>blade</b> upon his harness.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Hogan grimly, [...] "he was not arrested. He was buried. Before he had <b>wiped</b> his <b>blade</b> I {{had stepped}} {{up to him and}} accused him of murdering a beardless boy. I remembered the {{reckoning}} he owed you, I remembered that he had sought to send you to your death; I saw the boy's body still warm and bleeding upon the ground, and I struck him with my knuckles on the mouth. Like the cowardly ruffian he was, he made a pass at me with his sword before I had got mine out. I avoided it narrowly, and we set to work.|$|R
6000|$|There was no {{answering}} sympathy awakened {{in either}} of his listeners--they remained mute. Bridge rose and stretched. He picked up his knife, <b>wiped</b> off the <b>blade,</b> closed it and slipped it into a trousers' pocket. Then he walked toward the door. At the threshold he paused and turned. [...] "'Good-bye girls! I'm through,'" [...] he quoted and passed out into the sunlight.|$|R
60|$|It had all {{happened}} {{so quickly that}} the cook, mechanically <b>wiping</b> his <b>blade</b> on the tablecloth, hardly realized the foulness {{of the crime of}} which he had been guilty, but felt inclined to congratulate himself upon his desperate bravery. Then as he realized that, in addition to the offence for which the choleric Mr. Dunn was even now seeking the aid of the law, there was a dead bulldog and a spoiled carpet to answer for, he resolved upon an immediate departure. He {{made his way to the}} back door, and sheathing his knife, crept stealthily down the garden, and clambered over the fence at the bottom. Then, with his back to the scene of the murder, he put up his hands and ran.|$|R
50|$|Medical {{efforts to}} stop the plague, seen a little further to the right, were {{unchanged}} since the Middle Ages - an old doctor is incising the bubos to let the pus flow out, which is in fact inefficient in terms of treating the disease, and also weakens the patient. He has already operated on a bubo under the raised right arm of his patient, who holds a bloodied compress under his arm, and is <b>wiping</b> his <b>blade</b> ready to incise a second bubo. The doctor's assistant supports the patient during the operation. The bodies are sick, languishing, and the hero is less heroic for being surrounded by ordinary people. Idealism and classicism were abandoned in favour of a certain romanticism. In effect, this is suffering in painted form, which was a novelty - previously only noble deaths were painted.|$|R
5000|$|Important process {{variables}} in gravure coating & printing are the rotational position {{at which the}} <b>blade</b> <b>wipes</b> the cylinder; the angle that the blade makes with the tangent to the cylinder at the contact point; and the pressure applied to the blade. [...] Fine adjustment of in-and-out position, independently on left and right, must also be possible, in order to compensate for any misalignment between blade geometry and cylinder axis. These requirements are fulfilled by a doctor blade assembly which includes a doctor blade holder.|$|R
50|$|The next day, police {{searched the}} vicarage {{and found a}} case with four razors in the bedroom that Edalji shared with his father. Reverend Edalji said that the razors were old ones not in use. According to the police, they pointed out that one razor was wet; the Reverend took it and <b>wiped</b> the <b>blade</b> with his thumb; he later {{said that this was}} not true. Police said that a heel on the boots was worn down in an unusual way and left a {{distinctive}} pattern on the ground that matched heel impressions in an alleged trail of footprints between the vicarage and the scene of the crime. A local doctor who examined the housecoat for the police said that it was bloodstained, and there were 29 hairs on it similar to ones from the pony's hide near the wound. The doctor said that the hairs were small and difficult to see.|$|R
6000|$|Tarzan of the Apes smiled. As unmistakably {{as though}} a human voice had spoken, the lion had said to him [...] "I am hungry, even more than hungry. I am starving," [...] and the ape-man looked down upon the lion beneath him and smiled, a slow quizzical smile, and then he shifted the carcass from his {{shoulder}} to the branch before him and, drawing the long blade that had been his father's, deftly cut off a hind quarter and, <b>wiping</b> the bloody <b>blade</b> upon Bara's smooth coat, he returned it to its scabbard. Numa, with watering jaws, {{looked up at the}} tempting meat and whined again and the ape-man smiled down upon him his slow smile and, raising the hind quarter in his strong brown hands buried his teeth in the tender, juicy flesh.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{laryngoscope}} is {{a common}} piece of equipment used by anaesthesiologists. It {{has been identified as}} a potential source of cross infection. Although guidelines exist regarding appropriate disinfection practices, recent reviews suggest ineffectiveness of current methods of disinfection and poor compliance with the established protocols. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey to study the current disinfection practices being followed by a cross section of anaesthesiologists. Methods: A simple questionnaire containing 13 questions was distributed amongst anaesthesiologists in an anaesthesia conference. Data were analysed with percentage analysis. Results: Out of 250 delegates who attended the conference, 150 submitted the completed questionnaires. Residents constituted 41 % and 46 % were consultants. Eighteen (12 %) used only tap water for cleaning and 132 (88 %) used a chemical agent after rinsing with water. Out of 132, 76 (51 %) used detergent/soap solution, 29 (19 %) would wash and then soak in disinfectant or germicidal agents (glutaraldehyde, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine) and 18 (12 %) would <b>wipe</b> the <b>blade</b> with an alcohol swab. With respect to disinfection of laryngoscope handles, 70 % respondents said they used an alcohol swab, 18 % did not use any method, 9 % were not aware of the method being used, while 3 % did not respond. Conclusion: Our results indicate wide variation in methods of decontamination of laryngoscopes. Awareness regarding laryngoscope as a potential source of infection was high. We need to standardise and implement guidelines on a national level and make available resources which will help to improve patient safety...|$|R
50|$|In {{many parts}} of Indonesia, the kris {{used to be the}} choice weapon for execution. The executioner's kris had a long, straight, slender blade. The {{condemned}} knelt before the executioner, who placed a wad of cotton or similar material on the subject's shoulder or clavicle area. The blade was thrust through the padding, piercing the subclavian artery and the heart. Upon withdrawal, the cotton <b>wiped</b> the <b>blade</b> clean. Death came within seconds.In the 16th century, European colonial power introduced firearms into the archipelago that contribute to the decline of kris' prominence as the weapon of choice in battle. The forging of the edged weapons went into decline from the moment that the sultans or rajas were subjugated and their realms annexed by the British or Dutch East Indies colonial state. In number of regions, a ban was placed on carrying of cutting and stabbing weapons. In Java, the turning point {{was the end of the}} five-year-long Java War when the rebellious Prince Diponegoro was defeated and detained, and had to hand his kris over to the Dutch in 1830. This event marked the disarmament of the kris as a combat weapon among the Javanese populace. Its ceremonial function, however, as part of traditional costumes, as sacred heirloom and as a protective personal amulet, remains. The early 20th century saw the decline of kris forging as carrying edged weapons was banned in the Dutch East Indies. However its spiritual and ceremonial function still continues and is celebrated mainly in kraton and istana (courts) throughout Indonesia, Malaysia and the Muslim-inhabited parts of the southern Philippines.|$|R
40|$|During {{intaglio}} (gravure) printing, a <b>blade</b> <b>wipes</b> excess ink {{from the}} engraved plate with {{the object of}} leaving ink [...] filled cells defining the image to be printed. That objective is not completely attained. Capillarity draws some ink from the cell into a meniscus connecting the blade to the substrate, and the continuing motion of the engraved plate smears that ink over its surface. That smear behind the cell delivers a feature lacking in sharpness. Even though the smear formation occurs at micron scale, it affects the functionality at the scale of micron size printed electronics. By examining the limit of vanishing capillary number (Ca, based on substrate speed), we reduce the problem of determining smear volume to one of hydrostatics. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding free boundary problem for the Stokes equations of motion, we show that the hydrostatic theory provides an upper bound to smear volume for finite Ca; as Ca is decreased, smear volume increases. The theory explains why polishing to reduce the tip radius of the blade is {{an effective way to}} control smearing. As the motion continues, smear volume under the meniscus is printed as a tail behind the cell extending back toward the blade. In the limit of vanishing Ca, an inner and outer analysis of the meniscus printing problem shows that the meniscus rotates around the pinned contact line at the trailing edge of the cell, and the volume under the meniscus is used to coat a film of thickness decreasing linearly in time forming a tail shape. The tail lengthens with decreasing Ca, owing to the concomitant increase in smear volume; the opposite is true as Ca approaches O(1). For small Ca, it is computationally expensive to use the Stokes solver to show that the physical mechanism of tail formation described by the analysis as Ca → 0 is correct. Lubrication theory, on the other hand, predicts tail formation mechanism closely for contact angles over the blade close to / 2, and this motivates us to use the lubrication model for smaller Ca. With the continuing motion of substrate, we show the transition from the tip region (squeeze film) to the Landau-Levich film {{in the form of a}} tail shape extending back toward the bulk meniscus (static), and this agrees with the physical picture described by the analysis as Ca → 0. The results contribute to the control and understanding of smear formation mechanism during gravure printing of electronics...|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} with Felix in a tavern {{protecting}} {{a girl from}} the attentions of three huge trappers: Hef, Kell, and Lars. He holds his own until Gotrek comes in and drives them out. The girl introduces herself as Kirsten, and explains how her family {{is part of the}} von Diehl migration, a cursed noble family and their servants and their families moving to the Border Lands. Gotrek and Felix {{were on their way to}} the Dwarf stronghold of Karak Eight-Peaks because of stories of treasure they had heard. They decide to join the von Diehls, as they are heading in the same general direction, and they could use the cover afforded by carts. After traveling through the Grey Mountains, and reaching the Border Lands, Felix falls deeply in love with Kirsten, and she likewise. While camped in the Cursed Hills, the camp is attacked by Undead warriors, and during the fight, Felix kills the trapper Lars, after he goes crazy and attacks him. The men drive off the Undead, and they set off to find a ruined fort, which Gotrek helps repair, hinting at his pre-slayer background as an engineer. Finally, the fort is attacked by Wolf Riders, led by a Goblin Shaman, and during the first siege, Gottfried, the leader of the von Diehls, is struck by an arrow and is carried off by his son, Deiter; his nephew, Manfred; Frau Winter, a sorceress; and Kirsten, Frau Winter's assistant, to be healed. After a day of no word from them, and with the second siege starting, Felix goes off to investigate, leaving gotrek and the remaining men to fight off the horde ready to break through the gates. Felix comes across Frau Winter and Kirsten, the former who is dead and the latter who is dying. Felix watches her die, and swears to avenge her. He then comes across Dieter, whose head was bashed in, and enters Gottfired's room to see him stabbed to death in his bed with Manfred sitting there <b>wiping</b> off his <b>blade.</b> He then explains that the [...] "curse" [...] of the von Diehls was mutation brought on by a heretic cursing Manfred's grandfather. Manfred, going mad, explains that he broke the curse by killing all of the von Diehls. He and Felix duel, and Felix kills him, uttering [...] "The curse is broken". He goes outside to see Gotrek standing on a pile of goblin, wolf and human bodies, including Hef and Kell. He single-handedly held the gate, killing the Shaman and losing his eye in the process. The surviving humans are taken in by one of the many Border Princes, whilst Gotrek and Felix leave, and the story ends...|$|R
