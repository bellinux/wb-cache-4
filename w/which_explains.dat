5|$|In 1994, {{video game}} {{developers}} Wolf Team {{signed a deal}} with publisher Namco to release the game that would be Tales of Phantasia, which was later released in 1995 in Japan for the Super Famicom. However, the development cycle for this game was plagued with creative disputes between the developers and publisher, leading {{to much of the}} development team leaving to form a new company, which would become tri-Ace, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> some of the common themes between the games, such as the similar battle systems.|$|E

5|$|A House with Chimaeras was {{designed}} by the Polish architect Władysław Horodecki in 1901–1902. Horodecki was born in 1863 into a prosperous Polish szlachta family in the Podillia region. After finishing the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg in 1890, he moved to Kiev, where he lived for almost 30 years. At {{the time of the}} building's construction, Horodecki had already established himself as a prominent Kiev architect, having designed and constructed together with his close friend and partner engineer Anton Strauss many city buildings, from the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral to the Karaim Kenesa and what today is the National Art Museum of Ukraine. Besides architecture, Horodecki was also interested in big-game hunting, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> why his building features many animals.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E

After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 they would all be dead, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the land walls stands the second major {{entrance}} to the city, the Gate of Ploče. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E
5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how pretty, nice, and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> how a lady came to inherit the {{property}} of not only her children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Spiders are {{depicted}} in Indigenous Australian art, in rock and bark paintings, and for clan totems. Spiders in their webs {{are associated with}} a sacred rock in central Arnhem Land on the Burnungku clan estate of the Rembarrnga/Kyne people. Their totem design is connected with a major regional ceremony, providing a connection with neighboring clans also having spider totems in their rituals. Nareau, the Lord Spider, created the universe, according to the traditional Cosmology of Oceania's Kiribati islanders of the Tungaru archipelago (Gilbert Islands); similarly, Areop-Enap ("Old Spider") plays an important part in the creation myth of the traditional Nauru islanders of Micronesia. In the Philippines, there is a Visayan folk tale version of The Spider and the Fly <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> why the spider hates the fly.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, <b>which</b> <b>explains</b> the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
