Emotional capital {{is a crucial}} capital: more than an additional capital, {{it is also a}} booster capital. If social, cultural and, human capitals are often complementary (Coleman,1993), emotional capital has a particular place among them. It is first a catalyser as it is essential for the constitution of the human capital. Indeed, human capital constitution might never happen if basic or appropriate emotional capital is not there. Only ad hoc emotional capital will allow human capital formation. Also, emotional capital is a potentionalizing - boostering- capital more than a simple additional capital as it is essential for utilizing effectively the social capital and the Becker Human capital (the way it has been restrictedly measured as general knowledge and technical skills).

40|$|Fiscal {{austerity}} {{is having}} major impacts on public service organizations, but {{little is known}} about the effects of these changes on employees’ well-being, attitudes, and behaviors. Following a major UK national government announcement of budget reductions, we conducted a longitudinal field study of employees in diverse public sector organizations across the United Kingdom to address how the communication and the implementation of this external policy event affected employees. We ask two questions: First, how does a national policy announcement about substantial budget reductions affect employees’ <b>well-being</b> and attitudes <b>at</b> <b>work?</b> Second, how do cutback- and innovation-related changes that followed the budget announcement affect employees’ well-being, attitudes, and behavior? Results suggest that the budget announcement itself—before any changes had been implemented—negatively affected individual <b>well-being</b> and attitudes <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Further, we found differential effects on employees, depending on whether the budget reductions were followed by cutback related or innovation-related changes. Increases in cutback-related changes had negative effects on employees, yet an increase in innovation-related changes did not just have less negative but positive effects on employees’ positive well-being, job satisfaction, and engagement over time. However, contrary to previous research, some employee outcomes were not affected by either of the changes in this longitudinal study. We discuss implications of our findings for public management and for the psychological processes underlying the experience of organizational change across all sectors in times of budget reductions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{looks for}} current {{information}} about {{factors related to}} educational leadership that help to promote a positive working climate and which may ultimately influence the employees' overall <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The study focuses on finding out {{what is the role}} of open interaction for the development of a positive working climate. Crucial information about well-being promoting leadership practices is needed in the Finnish context. Previous research shows that employees' experiences of <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in educational organizations vary. Promoting employee well-being has become a crucial leadership issue in the Finnish society. Leadership training has been found to have a key position in promoting <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> However, the current training seems not to equip leaders to deal with well-being issues well enough. Research evidence supports the need to develop leadership in Finnish educational organizations especially with skills to do with leading people through interaction and managing personal relations. The main interest in the study is in the employees' views and interpretations on leadership practices promoting <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The study followed a qualitative case study approach. Six lecturers teaching in five degree programs representing different occupational fields in one Finnish university of applied sciences formed the case. The case organization represents vocational higher education, which is a suitable context providing information about leadership practices promoting <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The data were collected using a semi-structured interview as the data collection method. The data gathered in the interviews were analyzed using a qualitative inductive data-driven content analysis. The key findings gathered in three summary tables introduce factors essential for well-being in a work community. They provide a view about understanding good leadership as an enabling whole. This leadership approach relies on open interaction, an open discussion culture and reciprocity between leaders and employees. Enabling leadership practices in the educational context promote both the job satisfaction, the working climate and, in the end, <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> These leadership practices help to explain the development of a positive working climate. Open and appreciating interaction is considered an essential factor promoting the development of a good working climate. To sum up, co-working, group spirit and interaction are preconditions for a positive working climate. The findings support the current demands for developing leadership training in Finland to better equip leaders with skills that help to promote interaction and, thus, <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E
40|$|Overqualification {{is a form}} of {{underemployment}} wherein {{people have}} more skills, experience, knowledge, and abilities than required for a job. Past research has shown that overqualification is negatively related to subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> such as lower job satisfaction. To mitigate this negative impact, drawing on a job design perspective, the authors proposed that job autonomy can buffer overqualification's negative effects. Based on the model of culture fit in managerial practice, as well as regulatory fit theory, the authors further proposed that the buffering effects of job autonomy apply only to employees from individualistic (vs. collectivistic) cultures. Data from the 5 th European Working Conditions Survey were analyzed. Results of a two-level multilevel modeling analysis showed a three way interaction between overqualification, job autonomy, and national culture in predicting subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Job autonomy buffered the negative effects of overqualification on subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> but only in individualistic cultures...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: Analyze if the {{perceptions}} about {{policies and practices}} on human resources management (HRM), <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and expectations of organizational future act as antecedents of career expectations in the organization. Originality/gap/relevance/implications: The question "What will my future be in this organization?" is a relevant part of working life. Thus, {{it is important to}} assess which variables influence future career expectations. Based on theoretical contributions and previous surveys about career, well-being and HRM, the model tested coordinates variables that are analyzed in isolate by literature. Key methodological aspects: In this quantitative survey, 305 professionals from a government agency completed an e-questionnaire with scales validated in Brazil. Data were analyzed through structural equations models. Summary of key results: The effects of <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and expected future in the organization on the career expectations were positive and moderate, in the first case, and strong in the second case. The effect of perceptions of HR policies and practices on career expectations was completely mediated by <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and expectations of organizational future. Key considerations/conclusions: Results support the relations theoretically conceived or found in previous qualitative surveys. In practical terms, data suggest that improving HR policies and practices can increase <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and expectations of organizational future and, finally, foster positive career expectations in the organization. Considering that the research was limited to one organization, future investigations should analyze the model in other organizations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the development of <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> between 2001 and 2010 in a case-setting. The purpose is reached by means of a literature review on changes in Finnish working life, a theoretical framework and the empirical data. Changes in the Finnish working life are studied as a context of the study, helping the reader to understand the main changes that have taken place in the past two decades. The theoretical framework of the context of <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is constructed through concept analysis, concentrating on previous literature in the field. In the empirical part, the well-being in a case company is studied through survey data and annual reports of the company. The entire organisation is studied as well as an individual department in it. The empirical data is analysed using several methods such as descriptive statistics and content analysis. The <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> survey applied in the case company is also studied in more detail, reflecting the content to the framework of <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> that has been constructed. This analysis is conducted to study what aspects of <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> the items of the questionnaire relate to and to suggest how the questionnaire could be developed. Well-being in the case company reflects the changes that have occurred in Finnish working life. For example, at the same time as the employees in general expect more possibilities to influence matters that concern them in the workplace, the survey results show that opportunities to participate have declined. Several mean values in the survey have declined towards the end of the period of review, which may be due to the changing employee expectations and changes that have taken place both inside and outside of the organisation in this period. A special finding is that the mean values of the items measuring managerial work developed to the opposite direction compared to the other sets of items of the questionnaire.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the physical}} workplace environment affects employees’ satisfaction and, consequently, their perceived productivity and well-being. This study investigated whether employee “satisfaction” variables can predict perceived productivity, <b>well-being</b> and enjoyment <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and if so, to what extent. The study also explored whether limiting employees’ control over their environment could save energy without compromising employees’ satisfaction and perceived productivity. Preoccupancy and post-occupancy evaluation studies were conducted, {{in terms of both}} energy consumption and employee perceptions, to make comparisons between a company’s old and current headquarters buildings, both located in the same area of London. The results showed that employees were more satisfied with their <b>work</b> environment <b>at</b> their new HQ, in general, than with that of their previous office. Also, employees’ self-reported productivity, <b>well-being</b> and enjoyment <b>at</b> <b>work</b> improved after the move. It was revealed that the combination of employees’ level of satisfaction with “interior use of space” and “physical conditions” was the best predictor of their perceived productivity, while satisfaction with “indoor facilities” was not a good predictor. In terms of energy performance, although the new HQ’s energy consumption per m 2 was significantly less than that of the previous building, there was still a gap between the refurbishment design target and the actual performance of the building. The findings suggest that this gap could be due to a number of factors, including an ineffective use of interior space, and occupants’ behaviour...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundHealth, safety, and <b>well-being</b> (HSW) <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{represent}} important {{values in}} themselves. It seems, however, that other values {{can contribute to}} HSW. This is to some extent reflected in the scientific literature in the attention paid to values like trust or justice. However, an overview of what values are important for HSW was not available. Our central research question was: what organizational values are supportive of health, safety, and <b>well-being</b> <b>at</b> work?MethodsThe literature was explored via the snowball approach to identify values and value-laden factors that support HSW. Twenty-nine factors were identified as relevant, including synonyms. In the next step, these were clustered around seven core values. Finally, these core values were structured into three main clusters. ResultsThe first value cluster {{is characterized by a}} positive attitude toward people and their “being”; it comprises the core values of interconnectedness, participation, and trust. The second value cluster is relevant for the organizational and individual “doing”, for actions planned or undertaken, and comprises justice and responsibility. The third value cluster is relevant for “becoming” and is characterized by the alignment of personal and organizational development; it comprises the values of growth and resilience. ConclusionThe three clusters of core values identified can be regarded as “basic value assumptions” that underlie both organizational culture and prevention culture. The core values identified form a natural and perhaps necessary aspect of a prevention culture, complementary to the focus on rational and informed behavior when dealing with HSW risks...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution a chief concern of business organizations has been how best to organise work to maximise productivity and minimise costs. Securing and maintaining competitive advantage through new methods of work organization and systems of operation have largely centred around commercial and financial concerns {{rather than on the}} well-being of employees. Issues of occupational health and safety (OHS) have arisen in a range of working environments and legislative change has sought to ensure that safe and secure working conditions are a mandatory requirement of modern business. However, implementation of these mandates generally rests with management and whilst procedural regulations are broadly adhered to, more innovative solutions to OHS issues <b>at</b> <b>work</b> have been largely absent. The main argument of this paper is that traditional thinking and reactive policies to health issues <b>at</b> <b>work</b> have limited the development of innovative solutions to improve the <b>well-being</b> of people <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> We contend that the more recent interest in notions of social innovation, social entrepreneurship and social business, provide an opportunity to rethink approaches to, and our understanding of, occupational health and safety management in organizations. We commence our discussion by considering the emphasis in industrial production on the organization and control of work in the push for ever greater performance (and profits), often {{at the expense of the}} <b>well-being</b> of employees <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> We then turn attention to studies that have considered the social aspects of work and we consider the new and emerging concept of social innovation. In the final section, we forward a more holistic model of OHS for improving the conditions and well-being of employees in work settings. We conclude by calling for further research on social innovation and the management of OHS in the pursuit of sustainable healthy work environments...|$|R
