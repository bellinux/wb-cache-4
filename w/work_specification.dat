40|$|The paper formulates a {{model of}} wage {{determination}} in which the firm decides on employment after a monopoly union has determined wages. The novelty is to incorporate investment and capital decisions by firms. The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and its comparative statics for wages, capital stock and employment are characterized in various cases. The model is then estimated by using annual data from the Finnish manufacturing industry over the period 1960 - 87. The dynamic system of equations describing the determination of capital stock, wages and hours of work performs reasonably well; there are no obvious signs of misspecifications, coefficient estimates and other properties of the models are correct {{from the point of}} view of our theoretical reasoning. Diagnostics and various non-nested test procedures indicate that the conditional hours of <b>work</b> <b>specification</b> - where hours of work are determined recursively after the wage-capital stock game - outperforms alternative specifications implied by the conventional theory of the demand for factors of production.

The paper will deal with the details of the specification and the lessons learned in the first project in which it was used during the summer of 2002. Increasing traffic volumes and the demand from the motoring public to minimize delays at work zones throughout North America have led to the scheduling of some highway maintenance and construction activities to nighttime hours. A major cold planning and re-paving project on one of Nova Scotia’s busiest highways during the summer of 2002 had to be carried out during the night to avoid imposing excessive delays on motorists. A literature search, discussions with most state and provincial agencies, and research data from the Transportation Research Board and other sources were used in the development of the specification. Discussions with other provinces indicate that this may be the first comprehensive nighttime <b>work</b> <b>specification</b> by a Provincial Transportation Agency. The project was carried out during the summer of 2002 and the specification proved to be achievable and to meet our Department’s expectations. Detailed observations made during this initial project will be used to revise the specification for use on some projects in 2003...|$|E

40|$|Everyone brings some dispositions (factors) {{into his}} life, which cannot be swayed. In these factors belong for example skin colour, genetic dispositions or ethnicity. Some of these {{differences}} is possiibe to see on the first look and some follow up during the person´s life. It has connection with how we are felt with other people. It is very important how we feel ourselves. On base of some signs we categorize people according to stereotyped used phyziognomic signs. But {{the identity of the}} person can be in his conception totally different than it is felt by the other people. Ethnicity is one of the signs which we take in our lifes from the beginning of our existance. Concept of ethnicity correspond with name of race but it´s other meanings follow in the field of culture. Ethnicity is concentrated around same cultur conviction and practice. Forming of the "ethnic groups" consists in sharing of culture signs, which were developed in specific historical, social and political contexts and support the feeling of belonging. The meaning of ethnicity is partly from mythologic origin. Ethnicity is beeing formed on the base of how we express culture identity {{with the help of the}} language sings. Therefore is the ethnicity relative and it correlatives with categories of self interpretation and acquire of social status. The dissertation Perception of ethnicity in Low-treshold treatment programe for kids and young people is concentrated on the social workers´s view on social work with ethnicity of users the Low-treshold treatment program. These programes say thet the main group of their users are gypsies. In dissertation I work with the question if the social workers who work with the gypsies are swayed by their ehtnicity. If the social workers have to use some different methods when they work with the gypsies. In the Low-treshold treatment programe work the social workers mostly with children and young people who are social handicapped. Often there are children and young people who only drift aroudn the street. Often there are also children and young people who live in weak social environment and they live in bad areas where they have no opportunity for their personal progress. Quality these children´s life is very low even if we talk about the material aspect or their family background. I concentrate on explaining the word Ethnicity and ethnic minority in the theoretic part. How are the gypsies swayed with their own enthnicity and how do they live in the Czech Republic. Also I talk about the Low-treshold treatment programe for children and young people. Next I write about theories and methods of the social work. I decided for strategy of qualitative research in the empirical part. Here I used the method of questioning, technique of halfstandardized interview. I chose this technique becasuse it is possible to change it and modify during the analysis. Quality dates I recived, I adapted with the help of coding. The social workers in Low-treshold treatment programe made the basic complex for collecting the dates. They have been chosen because of their direct work with the users of the programe. The target of my dissertation was to identify how the user´s ehtnicity sways the work of the social workers. It follows from the resaults that the ethnicity is not important for the social workers. How they said, they feel the user´s ethnicity but in the mutual interaction with users they find some other, more important characteristics. One of the important attribute is the area which the users come from. Next factor is the bahaving of the children. Or the way how are the gypsies behaved. How the social workers said, they feel a little uselessness to change the habits. It followed from the interview that the success of their work is very low. If we talk about some social <b>work</b> <b>specification</b> it is necessary to work with the gypsies according to their social differences. Social workers choose the attitud...|$|E
