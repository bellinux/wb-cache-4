5|$|Exposure to anticancer chemotherapy, in {{particular}} alkylating agents, {{can increase the}} risk of subsequently developing AML. The risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy. Other chemotherapy agents, specifically epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines, have also been associated with treatment-related leukemias, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells.|$|E

5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> volatile, or HgRX, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E

5|$|This {{practice}} {{of using a}} variety of clarinets to achieve coloristic variety was common in 20th-century classical music and continues today.

5|$|Camouflage {{is common}} and {{widespread}} among beetle families, {{especially those that}} feed on wood or vegetation, such as leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> green) and weevils.

5|$|In ctenophores, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the activation of calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.|$|E
5|$|In writing {{polyphonic}} {{settings of}} psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm settings form {{a large proportion}} of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written polyphonic psalm settings. Some of Josquin's settings include the famous Miserere, written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 and most likely inspired by the recent execution of the reformist monk Girolamo Savonarola, Memor esto verbi tui, based on Psalm 119, and two settings of De profundis (Psalm 130), both of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (<b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E

In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.|$|E
5|$|Spiders a {{class of}} arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a {{cephalothorax}} and an abdomen. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At {{the end of each}} male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ.|$|E

The larvae of many species use silk to make protective cases, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> strengthened with gravel, sand, twigs, bitten-off pieces of plants, or other debris. The larvae exhibit various feeding strategies, with different species being predators, leaf shredders, algal grazers, or collectors of particles from the water column and benthos. Most adults have short lives during which they do not feed.|$|E
