50|$|Some {{designs for}} large telescopes use <b>whippletrees</b> {{to support the}} optical elements. The tree {{provides}} for distributed mechanical support, thereby reduces localised mechanical deflections, which in turn reduces optical distortion. Unlike the applications described above, which are two-dimensional, the <b>whippletrees</b> in telescope mirror support cells are three-dimensional designs, since the tree has to support multiple points over an area.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the same}} time, {{technological}} breakthroughs such as better harnessing material including <b>whippletrees,</b> traces, tribles {{as well as}} dyke and mill constructions went parallel with improved cultivation methods including selective cropping and grazing as well as crop rotation ( [...] the so-called three-field-rotation). They improved the supply of the population with food.|$|R
50|$|A swingletree, or singletree, is {{a special}} kind of <b>whippletree</b> used for a horse-drawn vehicle. The term swingletree is {{sometimes}} used for draught whippletrees generally.|$|E

5000|$|If several {{animals are}} used abreast, further whippletrees {{may be used}} behind the first. Thus, with two animals, each will have its own <b>whippletree,</b> then a further <b>whippletree</b> will balance the loads from their two whippletrees [...] - [...] this {{arrangement}} is sometimes known as a double-tree, or for the leaders in a larger team, leader-bars. With three or more animals abreast, even more whippletrees are needed; some may be made asymmetrical to balance odd numbers of animals. Multiple whippletrees balance the pulls from the different animals, ensuring that each takes an equal share of the work.|$|E
50|$|<b>Whippletrees</b> {{may also}} be used in modern agriculture, for example to link several ganged {{agricultural}} implements such as harrows, mowers or rollers to a tractor. In this case the effect is to combine several small loads to a single load at the tractor hitch (the reverse of the use for draught animals).|$|R
50|$|A <b>whippletree</b> {{balances}} the pull from {{each side of}} the animal, preventing the load from tugging alternately on each side. It also keeps a point load from pulling the traces in onto the sides of the animal.|$|E
50|$|A {{horse collar}} (or full collar). A padded loop fitting closely around the horse's neck, {{pointed at the}} top to fit {{the crest of the}} neck. Used for heavier pulling, {{especially}} when used without a swingletree or <b>whippletree.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} three {{cartoons}} of the series, Andy's companion was a feisty turtle named Mr. <b>Whippletree,</b> while Papa Panda—Andy's father—was often the fall guy for their pranks. When the turtle disappeared from the series, Papa began to function as both companion and foil.|$|E
50|$|A swingletree (British Isles) or singletree (North America) is {{a wooden}} or metal bar used {{to balance the}} pull of a draught horse or other draught animal when pulling a vehicle. It {{is a kind of}} <b>whippletree,</b> and the term is also used {{sometimes}} for other whippletrees.|$|E
50|$|Similar to cart harness {{but without}} breeching, used for dragged loads such as plows, harrows, canal boats or logs. This style {{is also used}} on the leaders in a team of animals pulling a vehicle. The traces attach to a <b>whippletree</b> behind the horse and this then pulls the load (or in larger teams may attach to further whippletrees).|$|E
50|$|The double shaft {{mechanism}} has two shafts rotating at constant speeds: one turns once a year, and {{the other}} twice a year. Cranks or pins attached to the two shafts move the two ends of a combining lever (sometimes {{referred to as a}} <b>whippletree)</b> sinusoidally; if the dimensions are chosen correctly, the midpoint of the rod moves in a way that simulates the equation of time.|$|E
5000|$|Linkage-type {{mechanical}} analog computers use <b>whippletree</b> linkages to add and subtract quantities {{represented by}} straight-line motions. The illustration here of whippletrees for a three-animal team {{is very similar}} to a group of linkage adders and subtracters: [...] "load" [...] is the equivalent of the output sum/difference of the individual inputs. Inside the computer, cylinders on the knob shafts have thin metal tapes wrapped around them to convert rotary to linear motion.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Duncan's Chinatown was the social centre for the Cowichan Valley's Chinese population. Chinatown was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} block in the southwestern corner of Duncan. At its largest point, Duncan's Chinatown included six Chinese families and 30 merchants who supplied goods and services to the loggers, millworkers, cannery and mine workers in the area. The city tore the buildings down in 1969 {{to build a new}} law courts complex. Some materials from the original buildings were used at <b>Whippletree</b> Junction.|$|E
50|$|Mama Panda {{joins the}} action and fights off some pygmies. A {{kangaroo}} successfully puts Andy in his pouch but he was distracted by a pygmy while another one slapped the kangaroo's fanny with a plank. The skunk, who had six months earlier scared the animals chases the pygmies away and the animals cheer and Andy is rewarded by Papa. Andy wishes that the events would {{be put in a}} newsreel and Papa, about to spank him, instead decides to snuggle Andy. As the cartoon ends, Mr. <b>Whippletree</b> the turtle, is seen chasing the pygmy who took his shell.|$|E
50|$|While they're talking, {{they start}} to leave the forest and enter a barren area. Papa warns Andy about the savage Pygmy hunters {{that live in the}} wasteland. Andy runs away from his dad into the wasteland and Papa runs after him and lands in a trap, presumably made by the hunters. The hunters spot Andy and begin to chase him. Finchell announces their plight to the animals and they gather to form a rescue mission. Mr. <b>Whippletree,</b> a turtle, is the first animal to attempt to rescue Andy but he fails because a hunter had his shell.|$|E
50|$|Whippletrees {{are used}} in tension to {{distribute}} forces from a point load to the traces of draught animals (the traces are the chains or straps {{on each side of}} the harness, on which the animal pulls). For these, the <b>whippletree</b> consists of a loose horizontal bar between the draught animal and its load. The centre of the bar is connected to the load, and the traces attach to its ends. Whippletrees are used especially when pulling a dragged load such as a plough, harrow, log or canal boat or for pulling a vehicle (by the leaders in a team with more than one row of animals).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>whippletree,</b> or whiffletree, is a {{mechanism}} to distribute force evenly through linkages. The mechanism may also {{be referred to as}} an equalizer, leader bar, or double tree. It consists of a bar pivoted at or near the centre, with force applied from one direction to the pivot and from the other direction to the tips. Several whippletrees may be used in series to distribute the force further, such as to simulate pressure over an area as when applying loading to test airplane wings. Whippletrees may be used either in compression or tension. Whippletrees were also used for subtraction and addition calculations in mechanical computers. Tension whippletrees are used in artful hung mobiles, as the ones the artist Alexander Calder started to build in 1932.|$|E
50|$|By 900 AD in Europe, {{developments}} in iron smelting allowed for increased production, leading to {{developments in}} the production of farm tools such as ploughs, hand tools and horse shoes. The plough was significantly improved, developing into the mouldboard plough, capable of turning over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population. Farmers in Europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations led to different crops being planted, including legumes such as peas, lentils and beans. Inventions such as improved horse harnesses and the <b>whippletree</b> also changed methods of cultivation.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "dog-tree" [...] {{entered the}} English {{vocabulary}} before 1548, becoming [...] "dogwood" [...] by 1614. Once the name dogwood was affixed {{to this kind}} of tree, it soon acquired a secondary name as the Hound's Tree, while the fruits {{came to be known as}} dogberries or houndberries (the latter a name also for the berries of black nightshade, alluding to Hecate's hounds). Another theory advances the view that [...] "dogwood" [...] was derived from the Old English dagwood, from the use of the slender stems of its very hard wood for making [...] "dags" [...] (daggers, skewers, and arrows). Another, earlier name of the dogwood in English is the whipple-tree. Geoffrey Chaucer uses [...] "whippletree" [...] in The Canterbury Tales ("The Knight's Tale", verse 2065) to refer to the dogwood. A <b>whippletree</b> is also an element of the traction of a horse-drawn cart, linking the drawpole of the cart to the harnesses of the horses in file; these items still bear the name of the tree from which they are commonly carved.|$|E
