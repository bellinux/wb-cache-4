5000|$|Expanding {{into the}} realm of {{railroad}} speculation, Thorne and his partner Marsden J. Perry bought up a controlling interest in the failing New York, Westchester and Boston Railway in 1906. In November 1906, after a long franchise fight, the New York & Port Chester Railroad and the New York, Westchester & Boston Railroad agreed to consolidate. [...] "Absolute" [...] control of both roads passed to Thorne and Marsden J. Perry. The Times reported that both had been directors in Westchester with controlling interests, and that Thorne had possibly secured a directorship with the opposition with the goal of securing the merger. Thorne was president of the Milbrook Company, which was organized as the holding company of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. The Milbrook Company then sold on October 29, 1907 by Thorne and Marsden. The merger resulted in a lawsuit by a banker with interest in the companies, seeking an injunction against the merger in late 1906. On January 10, 1908, after New Haven took over the holdings in the Westchester and Port Chester Railroads owned by Perry and Thorne, an injunction <b>was</b> <b>uphold</b> stalling Port Chester's purchase. In a formal statement issued on March 9, 1914, Thorne confirmed that he had accepted $8,250,000 from J. P. Morgan & Co. to purchase the New Haven Road, with the money used to purchase the securities of the New York, Westchester & Boston and New York & Port Chester Railroads. He had also purchased their construction companies and the developments, and upon the cancellation of his contract, Thorne turned over all the acquired assets to J. P. Morgan & Co.|$|E

The result of the study shows that a mean of N 18, 655. 33 was discoursed to each member as loan, while a mean of N 14, 965. 50 was repaid by each member of the group. Since the mean amount repaid is not significantly different from mean amount borrowed, t-cal 1. 17 0. 05). The null hypothesis which states that there is {{no significant difference between the}} amount borrowed and amount repaid <b>was</b> <b>uphold.</b> This implies that the micro finance user groups were efficient in loan repayment/recovery ability. The micro finance users groups recorded loan administration efficiency of 80. 20 %. A historical coefficient of variation of 14. 77 % and 13. 8 % indicate a steady growth rate in amount of loan disbursed and recovered respectively. It was therefore recommended that micro finance user groups should form linkage with financial institutions for the purpose of credit mobilization scheme. </p...|$|E

The Framework of Action Salamanca, 1994 {{is used as a}} basis of understanding the essentials of special education school. This {{research is}} conducted qualitatively using a narrative research design. Samples are selected purposively, whereby 3 special education teachers from a rural district in Johor with experience of more than 4 years are interviewed using semi structured interviews. The combination of narrative and semi structured interviews provides rich information of experience narrated in their own words and own settings. Data is analysed verbatim and triangulated using member checking and document analysis. The findings indicates that administration, facilities, transportation, lesser number of teachers, educational opportunity, funds and support from community are issues faced by these teachers. The overall research indicates that teachers are happy with their present condition although they have suggested that buildings should be modified to suit special education prior to establishment and special education schools should not be placed within the same vicinity.

40|$|Groundwater {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources in Denmark. It is consumed by private households, agriculture, fisheries, institutions and industry. Agricultural pesticides have been used in Denmark to protect crop yields. Most of the drinking water wells are located close to fields on which pesticides have been intensively applied. To fulfill the aim of Groundwater Directive 2006, Danish groundwater should have “good groundwater chemical status” by 2015. This directive has set up detection limits for concentrations of pesticides in drinking water. In 2011 the Danish government by law established a mandatory 25 meter pro-tection zone around water wells, allowing no commercial use of pesticides. In 2011 the Public Accounts Committee criticized the Danish Ministry of the Environment for their handling of securing that the limit values for pesticides in groundwater <b>was</b> <b>uphold.</b> In response to the crit-ic the Environmental Protection Agency presented their initiatives to improve the conditions through their Pesticide strategy for the period 2013 - 2015. The Environmental Protection Agency has put forward a plan to decrease the use of the most harmful pesticides with 40 % by the end of 2015. The Pesticide Strategy also involves new planned legislation which should increase the taxes on the pesticides, which are believed to have the most detrimental impact on the environment. The aim of this project was to define how pesticides best can be legislated in order to protect both groundwater aquifers, while maintaining high levels of agricultural production. By use of a stakeholder analysis, the most important stakeholders were identi-fied. Afterwards the stakeholders were analyzed, to find the ones that were most important to interview, to help answering the research questions and problem formulation. For interviewing the following stakeholders were chosen the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), Danish Water and Wastewater Association (DANVA), Nature Agency, Danish Agri-culture & Food Council (DAFC) and a municipality (Solrød). It was concluded, that a lot are done to prevent further pollution of the Danish groundwater. And generally the current way of regulating pesticides seems appropriate. However certain restrictions such as ban of private use of pesticides seem to be an obvious regulation to prevent pesticide leaching, combined with incorporation of the methods from the KUPA project regarding sandy soils, to regulate the use in the areas vulnerable for pesticide leaching. With regard to pin pointing the clay soils vulnerable for leaching further investigations are needed...|$|E
