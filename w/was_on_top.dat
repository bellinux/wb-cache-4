5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the steep slope difficult, but L Company <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire from the UN aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire on the crest and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid afternoon when a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain and surprised a platoon of L Company with an attack from behind. The other two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and drift down the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{current crest}} of the club {{is based on the}} {{official}} emblem of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is formed in a shape of a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished {{at the end of the}} 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the current badge of the club does not represent a white dove facing downwards to the castle, but an athlete. At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge uses only two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included the colour white, one of the traditional colours of the club, in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the shield. Since May 2012 the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest, which indicates the first ten domestic titles won by the club.|$|E

5|$|The {{match between}} Jerry Lawler's team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, Sleazy, and Cheesy), and Doink's Clowns R' Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink) {{consisted}} of comedic action {{for much of}} the first ten minutes. Eventually, Doink attempted a crossbody, but Lawler reversed the move. He was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match. Lawler remained involved in the match and {{played a role in the}} elimination of two more members of Doink's team. When Wink attempted a monkey flip against Queasy, Lawler blocked the move and helped Queasy to pin Wink. Later in the match, Lawler threw Cheesy on top of Pink, which enabled Cheesy to eliminate another of Doink's teammates. After Wink and Pink were eliminated, however, they hid under the ring rather than returning backstage. The final member of Clowns R' Us was eliminated after Sleazy and Dink fought in the ring. Dink performed a crossbody on Sleazy and attempted to pin him. Queasy rolled the wrestlers over so that Sleazy <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> however, and the referee made the three count and awarded the match to The Royal Family. As Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory. Dink, Pink, and Wink emerged from under the ring. All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased him away from the ring. As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in the face with a pie.|$|E

Following the mountain to the lake, he found the old corpse of the serpent, but it was just bones. Xwechtáal then took one of the vertebrae of the serpent and acquired magical supernatural powers with it.|$|E

25|$|The drought {{become a}} serious problem in late spring. In April, no rain fell in parts of Cornwall and then in June, no rain fell over Devon and Kent. In August no {{precipitation}} was measured in North Wales. This meant that in some places, {{less than half the}} average rainfall was measured from October 1975 to August 1976. For example, in Kew, just 235mm (9.25inches) of rain was measured over that period, which was 43% of the average, meaning the amount of rain that fell was comparable to a semi-arid climate. In Devon and Dorset, some locations received no rainfall for 45 consecutive days through July and August, another United Kingdom record. This <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of another 3 periods of absolute drought, totalling 58 days with no measurable precipitation.|$|E
25|$|Claude {{was known}} as the singing killer. Keep in mind that there was another Claude Dubois at the time whose career was purely musical. Claude was a nightclub singer in his spare time and was {{acknowledged}} as the singer of the Montreal organization. When he was young he started out by working as a door-man for the Mafia, which gave him a foot in the door of the criminal underworld as the Cotroni began to weaken it allowed him to expand his work into strip clubs and bars. He ran his empire very efficiently and would insure regular meetings to make sure he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of everything. Claude was very active in the downtown drug trafficking trade along with his brother Adrien. At the end of Claude’s career he was sentenced to 25 years for the murder of Cotroni’s brother-in-law in 1973.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked to}} {{maintain}} a strong network of contacts among anti-fascist intellectuals throughout Italy, {{while much of the}} Italian academic world bowed to the regime. With his former students and followers Ernesto Rossi and Carlo Rosselli he founded the first clandestine anti-fascist newspaper Non mollare (Don't Give Up) in January 1925. A half year later he was arrested and put on trial, but was released on a technicality, although he was kept under surveillance. Threats against his life were published in the Fascist press and his lawyer was beaten to death by Fascist blackshirts. His name <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the list of the Fascist death squads during raids on 4 October 1925 in Florence. However, Salvemini had fled to France in August 1925. He was dismissed from the University of Florence and his Italian citizenship was revoked in 1926.|$|E

25|$|Finnish coastal {{artillery}} made {{modifications to}} the gun mountings during the interwar period. The most significant of these was inverting the gun so that the recuperating spring <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the gun which allowed increasing the maximum elevation and thus the range. Inverting the gun however required also strengthening the recuperator, adding an equilibrator to correct the changed balance and other changes to the mounting and elevation mechanism. Increased maximum elevation also allowed using the gun as an anti-aircraft weapon. To increase maximum range even more the ammunition for the guns was modified by adding a ballistic cap to existing ammunition which increased the range {{by a factor of}} 1.5. Additionally Finns changed the gun loading practice to allow reloading without the need to return the gun to zero elevation after each shot. This practice increased the rate of fire.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Sakharovsky was {{succeeded by}} his 53-year-old former deputy Fyodor Mortin, a career KGB {{officer who had}} risen {{steadily}} through the ranks as a loyal protégé of Sakharovsky.

After 14 years in FCD Hq, he was to become chairman of the KGB in 1988. Kryuchkov joined the Soviet diplomatic service, stationed in Hungary until 1959. He then worked for the Communist Party headquarters in Ukraine for eight years before joining the KGB in 1967. In 1988 he was promoted to General of the Army rank and became KGB Chairman. In 1989–1990, {{he was a member of}} Politburo. The next and last head of FCD was born on March 24, 1935, in Moscow Leonid Shebarshin.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the other, resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a bottle of champagne.|$|E
