Radiation effects on high-level <b>waste</b> <b>glasses</b> and their surrounding repository environment are important considerations for radionuclide immobilization because of the potential to alter the glass stability and thereby influence the radionuclide retentive properties of this waste form.

Radiation may also affect the composition of aqueous fluids and atmospheric gases in relatively close proximity to the waste form.

The glass component in municipal waste is usually made up of bottles, broken glassware, light bulbs and other items.
