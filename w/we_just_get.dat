500|$|Florida still {{receives}} a thousand new residents daily and lands slated for restoration and wetland recovery are often {{bought and sold}} before {{the state has a}} chance to bid on them. The competitive pricing of real estate also drives it beyond the purchasing ability of the state. Because the State of Florida is assisting with purchasing lands and funding construction, some of the programs under CERP are vulnerable to state budget cuts. In June 2008 Governor Crist announced that the State of Florida will buy U.S. Sugar for $1.7billion. The idea came when sugar lobbyists were trying to persuade Crist to relax restriction of U.S. Sugar's practice of pumping phosphorus-laden water into the Everglades. According to one of the lobbyists who characterized it as a [...] "duh moment", Crist said, [...] "If sugar is polluting the Everglades, and we're paying to clean the Everglades, why don't <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> rid of sugar?" [...] The largest producer of cane sugar in the U.S. will continue operations for six years, and when ownership transfers to Florida, [...] of the Everglades will remain undeveloped to allow it to be restored to its pre-drainage state.|$|E

Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "a mundane forty minutes" [...] that [...] "really fails to impress", and noting that the plot follows [...] "more or less the same pattern", as the series' previous mythology episodes. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. Shearman described [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] as having been produced [...] "with style and wit", feeling that it featured a relatively static plot but was nevertheless entertaining. He found Duchovny's performance in the episode, and its final scene featuring Deep Throat's ambiguous motivations, to have been the highlights of an episode otherwise filled with [...] "smoke and mirrors"; comparing it to the earlier episode [...] "Conduit" [...] in this regard.|$|E

He leaves the day-to-day {{running of the}} firm to Sterling and Draper, but is {{keenly aware of the}} firm's operations. Bertram is a Republican. He is fascinated by Japanese culture, requiring everybody, including clients, to remove their shoes before walking into his office, which is decorated with Japanese art. He is also a fan of the writings of Ayn Rand. Among his eccentricities, Bert frequently walks through the offices in his socks and intensely dislikes gum-chewing and smoking, an oddity for the time, and especially considering Lucky Strike cigarettes is a major client through Season 4. He owns a ranch in Montana and is a widower with no children. Don approaches him about buying back the agency {{at the end of the}} third season, which evolves into their forming the new Sterling Cooper firm. In Season 4, [...] Roger Sterling, being a WWII veteran of the Pacific theater, is outraged at the possibility of taking on a Japanese client, Honda. [...] In a heated office meeting with some of the other executives including Peter Campbell, who had the lead, Roger says to Burt, [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> Dr. Lyle Levins in here?" [...] and storms out of the room, leaving Peter Campbell dumbfounded, asking, [...] "Who the hell is Dr. Lyle Levins?" [...] Interesting enough a few episodes later a drunk and lonely Don who is pulling an all-nighter at the office with Peggy stumbles upon an audio tape recording of Roger Sterling's memoirs that reveals that Bert received a war injury to his groin, and that ultimately he was castrated by an incompetent doctor, named Lyle Levins. Later in Season 4, in the episode [...] "Blowing Smoke," [...] when the agency is forced to radically downsize its staff following the loss of the Lucky Strike account, Bert tells the others that he is quitting the business. He is not seen for the rest of the season, but is back at work at the beginning of Season 5. Bert's sister Alice is a silent partner in Sterling Cooper. By the sixth season, Bert is increasingly frustrated with Don's erratic behavior and joins the other partners in placing him on a leave of absence. During the seventh season, he agrees to let Don return under an agreed set of stipulations. He dies while watching the Apollo 11 moon landing on television. He appears to Don in two dream sequences following his death.|$|E
