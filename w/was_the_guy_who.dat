500|$|During {{the fourth}} {{series of the}} late night spinoff show Hollyoaks Later, Mercedes' past was {{explored}} when she goes to Ibiza to celebrate her hen night.

She went on to elaborate {{that there was a}} lot her character wanted to say to Johnny but [...] "at the same time she doesn't see the point. There's a lot of anger there. But there's also a lot of excitement for Mercedes as she sees him again, because he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> won her heart for the first time. The storyline also explains why Mercedes is the way she is now". Mercedes and Johnny kissed, which Metcalfe said was them just [...] "getting lost in the moment" [...] and was partly due to Mercedes having doubts about Riley's fidelity. She added that Mercedes and Johnny spend time [...] "just talking and reliving the old times, especially how he won her over in the past".|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of}} all this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department realized that I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E
