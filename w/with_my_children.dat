2500|$|Lady Annabel is {{the mother}} of Rupert, Robin and India Jane Birley and Jemima, Zac and Ben Goldsmith. [...] She has {{referred}} to herself as [...] "an incredible mother, rather a good mistress, but not a very good wife". With six children and five miscarriages, her primary vocation was motherhood, which prompted her to say: [...] "I'm not judgmental about women who work, but I was so besotted <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> I never wanted them out of my sight." [...] She was also considered a mother figure by her nieces, Ladies Cosima and Sophia Vane-Tempest-Stewart, and Diana, Princess of Wales. As the wife and ex-wife of two unfaithful men, she explained her marriage philosophy to the Times in 1987: [...] "I can never understand the wives who really mind, the wives who set such store by fidelity. How extraordinary, and how mad they are. Because, surely, if the man goes out and he comes back, it's not actually doing any harm." ...|$|E

60|$|Helpless {{for lack}} of street clothing, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> on my knees, I sat in silence, noting the {{flickering}} glare of {{the light on the}} walls, and hearing the shouts of the firemen and the sound of their axes.|$|E
60|$|All {{that day}} I went {{about the house}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> like one whose world had {{suddenly}} begun to crumble. The head of my house was gone. Over and over again I stole softly into his room unable {{to think of him}} as utterly cold and still.|$|E
60|$|Having {{seen the}} job pretty tightly done, walked deliciously home through the woods. But no work all this while. Then for up and at it.

60|$|I {{have not}} enjoyed a play so much, so heartily, and so {{thoroughly}} since I played Miles Hendon twenty-two years ago. I {{used to play}} in this piece ("The Prince and the Pauper") <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children,</b> who, twenty-two years ago, were little youngsters. One of my daughters was the Prince, and a neighbor's daughter was the Pauper, and the children of other neighbors played other parts. But we never gave such a performance as we have seen here to-day. It would have been beyond us.|$|E
60|$|This {{was what}} these good women proposed, and bade me leave {{the rest to}} them. I was at first sadly afflicted at the {{thoughts}} of parting <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children,</b> and especially at that terrible thing, their being taken into the parish keeping; and then a hundred terrible things came into my thoughts, viz., of parish children being starved at nurse; of their being ruined, let grow crooked, lamed, and the like, for want of being taken care of; and this sunk my very heart within me.|$|E

6000|$|What could {{a puzzled}} parent do but bid his cabman follow like the wind? Miss Blossom's cab flew past Lord's, dived into Regent's Park, leading by two lengths; reached the Zoological Gardens, and there its crew alighted, demurely {{waiting for the}} Major. He leaped from his hansom, and taking off his hat, strode up to Miss Blossom, {{as if he were}} leading a charge. The {{children}} captured him by the legs. 'What does this mean, Madam?

There's no knowing what he might have done for you as well as for Fred. God knows, I'm fond of having you at home with me, but I can part <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> for their good.

6000|$|... "That was not all,--nor half. In your {{eagerness to}} serve such a miserable {{creature}} as this you forgot my entreaties, my commands, my position! I explained to you why I, of all men, and you, of all women, {{as a part}} of me, should not do this thing; and yet you did it, mistaking such a cur as that for a man! What am I to do? How am I to free myself from the impediments which you make for me? My enemies I can overcome,--but I cannot escape the pitfalls which are made for me by my own wife. I can only retire into private life and hope to console myself <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> and my books." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have lived}} very rough," [...] I heard a poor woman say, whose husband had ill used and deserted her. [...] "I {{have known what}} it is to be hungry and cold, and to work hard till my bones have ached. I only wish that I might have the same chance again. If I could have ten acres cleared two miles away from any living being, I could be happy <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children.</b> I find a kind of comfort when I am at work from daybreak to sundown, and know that it is all my own." [...] I believe that life in the backwoods has an allurement to those who have been used to it that dwellers in cities can hardly comprehend.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Time grew on,' she continued, 'and {{still there}} came no tidings {{that the peace}} was finally secured. We, that were hostages, lived {{separate}} from {{the people of the}} town; for we felt enmity towards each other even then. In my captivity there was no employment for me but patience--no pursuit but hope. Alone <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children,</b> I was wont to look forth over the sea towards the camp of our king; but day succeeded to day, and his warriors appeared not on the plains; nor did Priulf return with the legions to encamp before the gates of the town. So I mourned in my loneliness; for my heart yearned towards the homes of my people; I longed once more to look upon my husband's face, and to behold again the ranks of our warriors, and the majesty of their battle array.|$|E

If I had a little sum of money, I could fit myself out and come home to you as your father ought, and then I could offer myself for some decent place. With a good shirt and coat on my back, people would be glad enough to have me. I could offer myself for a courier, if I didn't look like a broken-down mountebank. I should like to be <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children,</b> and forget and forgive. But you have never seen your father look like this before. If you had ten pounds at hand--or I could appoint you to bring it me somewhere--I could fit myself out by the day after to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|If I saw a venomous snake {{crawling}} in the road, any {{man would}} say I might seize the nearest stick and kill it; but if I found that snake in bed <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children,</b> {{that would be}} another question. I might hurt the children more than the snake, and it might bite them. Much more if I found it in bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn compact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would become me to let that particular mode {{of getting rid of}} the gentleman alone. But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them, I take it no man would say there was any question how I ought to decide! ...|$|E
60|$|Well, I dreamed on, talking <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> in {{my sleep}} and naming them by their beloved names, till at length I woke to look on emptiness, and knowing all my sorrow I sobbed aloud. Now it was early morning, and {{the light of the}} August sun {{streamed}} through the window, but I, deeming that my wife slept, still lay in the shadow of my dream as it were, and groaned, murmuring the names of those whom I might never see again. It chanced, however, that she was awake, and had overheard those words which I spoke with the dead, while I was yet asleep and after; and though some of this talk was in the tongue of the Otomie, the most was English, and knowing the names of my children she guessed the purport of it all. Suddenly she sprang from the bed and stood over me, and there was such anger in her eyes as I had never seen before nor have seen since, nor did it last long then, for presently indeed it was quenched in tears.|$|E
