5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
25|$|People often saw Han {{riding a}} donkey along the West Lake, take {{a bottle of}} wine, sit, and {{sprinkle}} a bit of it upon Yue‘s grave. He <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Yue in a soft and emotional way, regardless of the weather; rain or snow.|$|E
25|$|Ottaway {{appears to}} have been well {{regarded}} by his teammates, but there are hints that he practised the snobbery not uncommon among men of his class and time. The Sheffield amateur J.C. Clegg (later Sir Charles Clegg, President of the Football Association), who played alongside him in the first England-Scotland international, remarked in later years that none of the southern amateurs in the side <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of a pivot language {{is that each}} step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities - using a pivot language involves two steps, rather than one. For example, when Hernán Cortés communicated with Mesoamerican Indians, he <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> Spanish <b>to</b> Gerónimo de Aguilar, who <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> Mayan <b>to</b> Malintzin, who <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> Nahuatl <b>to</b> the locals.|$|R

25|$|Work on the {{construction}} of the Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo began in the 13th century on an area that had been occupied since 1157 by the papal palace built under the reign of Pope Hadrian IV. The original Palazzo del Capitano was a single ground-floor loggia that was used as a market place or for meetings, from which the magistrate <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the citizens. This was where the surrounding lords or representatives of vanquished cities came to pay their allegiance to Orvieto.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2012 Andrea Gilroy, David Gilroy's wife, {{was cited}} as a witness by the Crown. As she took the stand, the trial judge Lord Bracadale {{explained}} {{that she had the}} right not to give evidence against her husband if she did not wish. She declined to give evidence. Mrs Gilroy could only decline to give evidence because the events she <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> took place before section 86 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force. This act amended the law such that spouses and civil partners of an accused person in Scotland, are competent and compellable witnesses for the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Barât {{had been}} {{setting up a}} weekly club night called Dirty Pretty Things (a later dispute forced it to be renamed Bright Young Things) at the Infinity Club in the West End. The day Doherty left the Priory for the second time, {{he went to the}} club and spoke with Barât, with Hassall and Powell present as well. Doherty told him {{that he was going to}} Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand to get clean. The Libertines {{performed}} a short set that night: it was the last time they would all play together for more than six years, and the last time Doherty <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Barât for more than nine months.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} to Charles' background in science fiction, Philippa Forrester {{was best known}} as co-host of the science and technology programme Tomorrow's World. Her role on Robot Wars was as the pit reporter who <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> contestants about their robots before and after battles. Forrester was pit reporter for six of the show's nine series; Julia Reed took the role for Series 4 and Extreme 1 since Forrester was unable {{to participate in the}} programme due to pregnancy, but Forrester returned for Series 5, Series 6 and Extreme 2. When the programme moved to Channel 5 for the seventh series, Forrester did not return for unknown reasons, so Jayne Middlemiss took over the pit reporter duties.|$|E
25|$|Stake {{and ward}} Young Women {{organizations}} are supervised by the Young Women General Presidency. From 1994 to 2013, an annual General Young Women Meeting {{was held in}} March, where typically the Young Women general presidency {{and a member of}} the church's First Presidency <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the young women, their mothers, and the adult Young Women leaders. The meeting was broadcast via satellite to LDS Church meetinghouses throughout the world. The proceedings of the meeting were published in the May issues of the Liahona and Ensign magazines. Video and audio of the proceedings are archived and available for downloading on the church's website. In 2014, the meeting was replaced by a semiannual general women's meeting for those eight years of age and older.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Barbree {{has stated}} that he has stayed away from sensationalizing the space program, or those {{associated}} with it, and commented {{that he would not}} put some items that could be considered harmful into his newest book, stating [...] "The whole idea of the book is not to hurt somebody." [...] Barbree attempts to illustrate this in his memoir by telling of a private investigator who approached him with an audio tape which allegedly contained proof of an extramarital affair involving an astronaut. Barbree told the investigator he <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> his superiors, but then proceeded to erase the tape.|$|E

500|$|Bowers {{notes that}} St. Elmo was filmed in a mansion built in 1759, {{but the name}} and {{location}} of the structure is unknown. The actual date of the filming is unknown. During {{the weeks leading up}} to the release, a spy for Thomas Edison's production company recorded details surrounding Thanhouser's production, including the filming of Thanhouser's first release, The Actor's Children. The spy, W. E. Lowenkamp, had a New York State Detective license. Lowenkamp's reports suggest the possibility of filming in a house on March 10, 1910 and the intention to film the following morning, but it is unknown if this was related to St. Elmos filming. Lowenkamp <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Edwin Thanhouser's sister in law, Carey L. Hastings, who took him as a real estate salesman was in film. Bower's reprints the report, [...] "The sister-in-law said the house they were using to take pictures would just suit Mr. Thanhouser, so I called a real estate office and gave them the tip so they will try and sell the house to Mr. Thanhouser and cover me." [...] The film also included Gertrude Thanhouser, the wife of Edwin Thanhouser. According to family tradition, she only appeared in this one film.|$|E
500|$|Child actress Helen Badgley, {{also known}} as The Thanhouser Kidlet, is {{described}} by [...] the Thanhouser Company who made the film as a [...] "precocious child actress who was very comfortable and expressive {{in front of the}} camera". Shep the Dog, {{also known as}} The Thanhouser Collie, was a well-trained animal performer who appeared in a number of the company's films during this period. The dog's acting, in portraying a range of emotions including [...] "depression", [...] "groveling pathos" [...] and [...] "joy", was noted to be superior to the child's performance. Shep was owned by the film's director Jack Harvey, but Shep had prior experience working for Vitagraph under Arthur Ashley. While at Vitagraph, Shep received very little coverage and recognition in comparison to Jean, the [...] "Vitagraph Dog". Evidence suggests that Shep starred in Shep, the Hero. Jack Harvey believed Shep to be almost human, he would direct Shep entirely by voice and <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him with [...] "man talk" [...] instead of simple commands. At an unknown, but presumably later date, Shep's mate of four years, Bessie, became ill and Harvey saw it take a terrible emotional toll on Shep. When Bessie died, Harvey stated it would cause Shep to die of a broken-heart. While A Dog's Love was released little more than a month before Shep's death in early November 1914, two more films had yet to be released. Both The Barrier of Flames and Shep, the Sentinel would be released posthumously.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2013, {{there was}} an {{expectation}} that the program might succumb to budget pressures in the USAF. In May 2013, the T-X industry day was postponed [...] "until further notice" [...] due to the fiscal climate. In December 2013 {{the head of the}} program said there were no plans for 2014 or 2015, but that he <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the chief of staff about the program either in February 2014 or later.|$|E

2500|$|Richardson {{formed a}} foundation, the Richardson Center, to help {{negotiate}} {{the release of}} political prisoners globally. In January 2013, he led a delegation of business leaders, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt, shortly after the state had launched an orbital rocket. Richardson called the trip a [...] "private, humanitarian" [...] mission by U.S. citizens and told the Associated Press he <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> North Korean officials about the detention of Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen accused of committing [...] "hostile" [...] acts against the state, and seek to visit the American.|$|E
2500|$|Philo {{taught that}} the two cherubim in [...] {{represented}} God's two primary powers – (1) God's beneficent power, in accordance with which God made the world, and in respect of which God is called [...] "God," [...] and (2) God's chastening power, according to which God rules and governs what God has created, and in respect of which God is called [...] "Lord." [...] Philo read [...] to teach that God's two powers were divided in the middle by God standing above them both. And [...] reports that God <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the Israelites from between the two cherubim to show {{that the two}} powers are equal, God's beneficent and chastising powers being divided by the same Word.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{period in}} Milan, Montini was {{widely seen as}} a {{progressive}} member of the Catholic hierarchy. He reformed pastoral care, adopting new approaches. He used his authority {{to ensure that the}} liturgical reforms of Pius XII were carried out at the local level and employed innovative methods to reach the people of Milan. For example, huge posters announced throughout the city that 1,000 voices <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> them from 10 to 24 November 1957. More than 500 priests and many bishops, cardinals and lay people delivered 7,000 sermons in the period not only in churches but in factories, meeting halls, houses, courtyards, schools, offices, military barracks, hospitals, hotels and other places, wherever people congregated. His goal was the re-introduction of faith to a city without much religion. [...] "If only we can say Our Father and know what this means, then we would understand the Christian faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Tosefta {{reasoned}} that if God charged even the wise and righteous Joshua {{to keep the}} Torah near, then so much more so should the rest of us. The Tosefta noted that [...] says, [...] "And Joshua the son of Nun was full {{of the spirit of}} wisdom, for Moses had laid his hand upon him," [...] and [...] says, [...] "The Lord <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another. And he would then return to the camp; and his minister, Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, stirred not from the midst of the Tent." [...] And yet in [...] God enjoined even Joshua: [...] "This Book of the Torah shall not depart out of your mouth, but recite it day and night." [...] The Tosefta concluded that all the more so should {{the rest of the people}} have and read the Torah.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "door sequence" [...] {{was created}} to {{transition}} from skit segments to the theater segments, which Hodgson took inspiration from the Mickey Mouse Club, noting that the commonality to the title credits of Get Smart were coincidental. In devising this sequence, this also led to Beaulieu creating the dogbone-like shape of the Satellite of Love with additional inspiration taken from the bone-to-ship transition in the film [...] Hodgson had wanted to use a [...] "motivated camera" [...] for filming, a concept related to motivated lighting; in this mode, all the shots would {{appear to have been}} taken from an actual camera {{that was part of the}} scene to make the scene appear more realistic. This led to the creation of Cambot as a robot that the host <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> during host segments or filming them while in the theater, and Rocket Number Nine to show footage outside of the Satellite of Love.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{confrontation}} {{took place at}} a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford on Saturday 30 June 1860. While there was no formal debate organised on the issue, Professor John William Draper of New York University was to talk on Darwin and social progress at a routine [...] "Botany and Zoology" [...] meeting. The new museum hall was crowded with clergy, undergraduates, Oxford dons and gentlewomen anticipating that Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, <b>would</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> repeat the savage trouncing he had given in 1847 to the Vestiges published anonymously by Robert Chambers. Owen lodged with Wilberforce the night before, but Wilberforce would have been well prepared as he had just reviewed the Origin for the Tory Quarterly for a fee of £60. Huxley was not going to wait for the meeting, but met Chambers who accused him of [...] "deserting them" [...] and changed his mind. Darwin was taking treatment at Dr. Lane's new hydropathic establishment at Sudbrooke Park, Petersham, near Richmond in Surrey.|$|E
