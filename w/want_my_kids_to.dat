5000|$|In March 2011, {{one month}} after being elected to Dáil Éireann, Flanagan {{announced}} that he would cease his smoking of cannabis while in Ireland in order to protect his family and focus on the issues for which he stands. He said he still intended to smoke cannabis when abroad. This followed a formal complaint lodged to the Garda Síochána by a Fianna Fáil councillor from Kilkenny about his cannabis use. Flanagan said that: [...] "...my wife and children are the most important people on the planet to me and I dont <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> witness the Garda calling to the house."

5000|$|In February 2007, a {{group called}} LOVE (the Livingston Organization for Values in Education) {{challenged}} four books in the Howell High School curriculum, including The Bluest Eye. Black Boy by Richard Wright, Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, and The Freedom Writers Diary were also challenged. Vicki Fyke, the founder of LOVE, challenged the books due to their images of sex, rape, and incest, claiming that inclusion of these books {{in a high school}} curriculum did not comply with federal child pornography and obscenity laws, and was against Michigan's sexual education laws. In addition to Fyke, some members of the school board and parents were against the curriculum, one arguing, [...] "At the end of the day, they're my kids. I don't <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> read books. I don't let them eat just anything...I want you to respect that". The school board Vice President also argued that parents should receive warnings of the type of material that is discussed in their children's curricula, and that students should have the option to avoid a particular book based on content. The National Coalition Against Censorship published a letter in response to the criticism, claiming that scenes involving sex [...] "represent small but essential parts of the novels, consistent with the kind of material that high school students frequently read". Their letter also argued that the books in question [...] "are widely recognized as works of significant literary and artistic merit", and [...] "are widely taught in high schools and colleges around the country".|$|E

[...] Inspired {{after the birth}} of his second daughter, Paul said that he wanted to teach his children about the world through the use of music. The songs are meant to be enjoyed by both children and adults, and Paul said [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> hear music with social commentary and some fantasy involved." [...] Scott Alarik said [...] "Paul sings movingly about what really worries new parents, and turns lazy dragonflies, gentle monsters, and resilient roses into useful metaphors for world peace, the power of faith, and the delights of a sleepy day." [...] In April 2008 the Parents' Choice Foundation awarded The Dragonfly Races a Silver Medallion. [...] The Parents' Choice Awards program honors the best material for children in these categories: books, toys, music and storytelling, magazines, software, videogames, television and websites.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues raised}} by comparing Santayana’s warning that ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it’ (1905; The Life of Reason) with the future hopes of contemporary teenager Ramon: ‘I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> have a better life than I did. I’d like them to grow up in a more compassionate society’. Pollock (2000; Real Boys Voices). The conundrum raised by these quotations is that since Australia lacks a substantial body of historical writing about its own past and peoples (Indigenous or otherwise) which might appeal to a youth readership, how are we to avoid repeating the horrors of the past? Crew will suggest that perhaps one answer lies {{in the creation of a}} new and engaging historical genre for youth which applies emergent ficto-critical stylistics to the concepts of the Australian Historian, Professor Greg Denning (1994; Mr Bligh’s Bad Language), who advocates, ‘In writing history…I have always found that I needed to give a voice to the dead. I couldn’t give them life, of course, but I could give them a voice. And I could give the living an understanding of the past for the present…’ Denning, G. (2001) A Library Sailor. Limina Vol...|$|E
40|$|Despite the oft-heard {{claims that}} current generations are {{stealing}} from future generations by running fiscal deficits, both theory and evidence {{suggest that this}} is either not true or not knowable. Intergenerational justice is not an appropriate lens through which to analyze fiscal issues, {{because there is no}} obvious starting point from which to build a moral consensus about whether current generations owe anything at all to future generations - and even if we do believe that we owe something to future generations, no one has offered a useful method by which we can determine whether we are doing enough for our progeny. Moreover, if we believe that future generations should be made better off than current generations (2 ̆ 2 I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> be richer than I am. 2 ̆ 2), even pessimistic forecasts indicate that future generations will be much wealthier than current generations, meaning that we are already being quite generous to our children and grandchildren. In addition, the recent significant decline in our economic prospects does not argue for a more contractionary fiscal policy in light of concerns about future generations. In fact, when times are bad, there is no conflict between the interests of current and future generations. Spending by the government helps to improve the economy, which encourages businesses to invest in future productivity. This virtuous cycle is even stronger if the government 2 ̆ 7 s spending is itself used to invest in future productivity...|$|E

5000|$|While {{three of}} the singles {{released}} from the album have been upbeat pop songs many of the songs have darker themes about relationship problems. In an interview with BuzzFeed Sebastian explained {{that they are not}} about himself and his wife, saying, [...] "There’s a lot of songs about relationships coming to an end, and even being in denial of that. Not because of anything to do with my own personal relationships! But I’ve had people who are very close to me go through break-ups, and I’ve sort of watched it the whole way through, and it’s been very close to my heart as of late. It’s really occupied my headspace, and my writing space". Sebastian says his family did influence the album however. Missing out of family life because of the damands of work and constant travelling overseas began to frustrate him. Two songs on the album, [...] "Alive" [...] and [...] "Light and Shade", are about making the most of your life and living in the moment, and are reminders to himself {{that there needs to be}} a happy medium between career and family life.
