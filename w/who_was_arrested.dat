The gunboat misidentified the British warship as a republican destroyer of the Churruca-class.

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{security}} after the 2016 election, {{there have been}} some detentions and arrests that have been related to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, a woman managed to bypass security and go to the 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump's office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later on December 13, a Baruch College student <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> at Trump Tower was found to have multiple weapons, including knives, a garrote, and firecrackers. The next day, another man reportedly got angry after he wanted to meet Donald Trump at the tower, and after throwing a wine glass onto the floor of the tower's lobby, was subsequently detained by the NYPD.|$|E

5|$|According to the indictment, {{the crime}} {{organization}} headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering {{business in the}} US from 2002 to 2006, processing {{tens of millions of}} dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank, through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, that led to his sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million shekel. The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{was freed}} and {{returned}} to Israel after having served about {{three years in prison}} first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to build a case against Meir Abergil, leading to a plea agreement approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.|$|E
5|$|In late 1916 he was {{approached}} by Fasih al-Ayyubi in hope that Quwatli could help him secure an escape route for his ailing father, Shukri al-Ayyubi, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> by the Ottomans, like he did for Nasib al-Bakri. However, despite Quwatli's refusal to help, Ottoman authorities tracked down the contact and arrested both men. Quwatli was subjected to further torture to coerce him to reveal the names of his al-Fatat colleagues. In an attempt to prevent himself from surrendering the names, Quwatli tried to commit suicide. After cutting his wrists, Quwatli's life was saved {{at the last minute}} by fellow inmate, al-Fatat member and practicing doctor, Ahmad Qadri. He spent four more months in jail, before being released on bail by his relative, Shafiq al-Quwatli, who served as a deputy at the Ottoman Parliament, on 28 January 1917. His experience in jail and the story about his attempted suicide turned Quwatli into a nationalist hero in Syria.|$|E

5|$|On 18 April Keeler was {{attacked}} {{at the home}} of a friend. She accused Gordon, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> and held. According to Knightley and Kennedy's account, the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward, but he refused. The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward, whose practice was collapsing rapidly. On 7 May he met Macmillan's private secretary, Timothy Bligh, to ask that the police inquiry into his affairs be halted. He added that he had been covering for Profumo, whose Commons statement was substantially false. Bligh took notes but failed to take action. On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke, with essentially the same request as that to Bligh, to be told that the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry. Ward then gave details to the press, but no paper would print the story. He also wrote to Wilson, who showed the letter to Macmillan. Although privately disdainful of Wilson's motives, after discussions with Hollis the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward's general activities to ask the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, to inquire into possible security breaches.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals did {{not take}} their loss of power gracefully. In May and June 1842, three uprisings broke out, in the provinces of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. The rebels {{went so far as}} to arrest and hold hostage both Honório Hermeto's elderly father and uncle (who was also his father-in-law). As president, he {{commanded}} the provincial National Guard, and traveled through the province to organize a response. On 1 July, he advanced with troops towards Ouro Preto, where, after defeating the rebels, he freed his father and uncle. He joined forces there with Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Baron and later Duke of Caxias), who commanded the National Guard of São Paulo and Minas Gerais and was also married to one of Honório Hermeto's distant cousins. The remaining rebels were easily defeated, and by late August, the uprisings had been quelled. Among the rebel leaders was the former regent, Feijó, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested.</b> He died shortly afterwards in 1843. As Honório Hermeto returned from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro, he was welcomed with celebrations and demonstrations of joy by the authorities and populace of the districts he traversed.|$|E
5|$|Fay Michael Peter v. Public Prosecutor (1994) {{concerned}} an American teenager, Michael P. Fay, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> in 1994 for vandalizing {{cars and}} stealing street signs. He {{pleaded guilty to}} two charges of vandalizing by spraying paint {{on a number of}} cars. On conviction by a subordinate court, he was sentenced to a total of four months' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. For the purposes of sentencing, other charges were taken into consideration, including 16 charges of vandalism involving paint. Fay appealed to the High Court against the sentences, arguing that (a) proviso to section 3 of the Vandalism Act required the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the indelible quality of the paint used before caning could be imposed; (b) a probation order was appropriate in this case; and (c) the trial judge below should have ordered a pre-sentencing report with a view to ordering probation. The appeal was dismissed. The case generated intense media interest in the United States, culminating in a formal request from the US Government for the caning sentence not to be carried out. The Singapore Government rejected the request on the basis that foreigners in Singapore could not be held to a different standard from citizens. However, it recommended that the President reduce the caning from six strokes to four.|$|E

5|$|Two {{extensive}} espionage {{cases in}} Sweden during the Cold War involved Boden Fortress, both exposed in 1951. The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom, a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden, {{and later the}} local editor for the communist newspaper Norrskensflamman. He was exposed by his own careless talkoften {{under the influence of}} alcoholto the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden. The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951, and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952. During interrogation, he confessed that hefrom February 1943 to April 1951had met with Soviet employers around 25 times. Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence, most of it from public sources, but also secrets, of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the pieces of information that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications. He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour, but was released after ten years. The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> on 21 September 1951. He had carried out seven missions for the Soviets and had provided them primarily with information regarding the Swedish Navy, but also information on the fortifications along the Norrland coast, and an initiated report about Boden Fortress and the airforce unit located in Boden and Luleå, Norrbottens flygbaskår. Andersson was, like Fritjof Enbom, sentenced to hard labour for life.|$|E
