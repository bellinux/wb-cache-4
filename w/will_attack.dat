5|$|After mating, {{the female}} washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} {{to mate with}} her at this point, the female <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} predators thought to attack healthy adults, and who attack emperor {{penguins}} in the water, are both mammals. The {{first is the}} leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), which takes some adult birds, as well as fledglings soon after they enter the water. Orcas (Orcinus orca), mostly take adult birds, although they <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> penguins of any age in or near water.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E

50|$|Pigs <b>will</b> {{sometimes}} <b>attack</b> other animals, including humans.|$|R
5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
5|$|Black {{rushes to}} Beebe's home, knowing the dogs <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> it. Beebe refuses to leave, {{but the house}} has been {{surrounded}} by five dogs; as they are killed they are seemingly endlessly replaced by others. The Old Man arrives, and insists {{the only way to}} rid the town of the dogs is burn down Beebe's house, which the trio do before fleeing. Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling his wife that they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved.|$|E
50|$|Yes, we <b>will</b> both <b>attack</b> at the {{agreed-upon}} time.|$|R
50|$|A light <b>attack</b> <b>will</b> execute small {{projectiles}} {{from far}} away. These projectiles will not deplete your Psycho Gauge and are weak. A strong <b>attack</b> <b>will</b> fire a bigger projectile, and depletes your Psycho Gauge by 30%. When both characters are close together, {{the light and}} strong <b>attacks</b> <b>will</b> execute punches and kicks. The light attack can be pressed multiple times for a combo while the strong <b>attack</b> <b>will</b> deliver a powerful blow. As noted before, the strong <b>attack</b> <b>will</b> consume 30% of the Psycho Gauge. So when the Psycho Gauge is depleted, the character will fire small projectiles just like pressing the light attack from far away. Another thing to note is the two commands that are available for the first move of every character. As the strong <b>attack</b> <b>will</b> deliver a strong physical attack up close, the other {{will be used to}} fire a projectile.|$|R

5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
5|$|The African crake is {{territorial}} on {{both the}} breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat display involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards the intruder, or walk {{side by side with}} another displaying male. The female may accompany the male, but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking. Paired females <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> other females in the territory, especially if the male has shown an interest in them.|$|E
5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2016, Lavrov {{stated that}} Russia <b>will</b> never <b>attack</b> any NATO country, saying: “I am {{convinced}} that all serious and honest politicians know perfectly well than Russia <b>will</b> never <b>attack</b> a member state of NATO. We have no such plans.” He also said: “In our security doctrine it is clearly stated {{that one of the}} main threats to our safety is the further expansion of NATO to the east.” ...|$|R
50|$|If each {{of these}} forces is constant, {{altering}} {{the angle of the}} screed to the horizontal (angle of <b>attack)</b> <b>will</b> control the amount of material extruded behind the screed. Increasing the angle of <b>attack</b> <b>will</b> cause the screed to climb higher through the pile of material, and therefore raise its trailing edge, increasing the amount of material extruded behind the screed. Similarly, reducing the angle of <b>attack</b> <b>will</b> reduce the amount of material extruded.|$|R
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, but {{it takes}} birds, such as little penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including flying foxes) as well. In the Bismarck Archipelago it has been {{reported}} feeding on two species of possum, the northern common cuscus and common spotted cuscus. It is a skilled hunter, and <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> prey up {{to the size of a}} swan. They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov with a shot to the chest.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wills</b> <b>attacks</b> both Eddie and Francis with {{accusations of}} concocting {{different}} plans {{to hurt the}} family fortune, but Joan is on their side and hands the letter to Francis. When Eddie goes to the tailor again to fetch his new suit, Arnold meets him there, furious {{over the fact that}} Wills' check bounced. Instead, Arnold demands that his payment be in rare books from the Pemberton library, and they go there to steal books at his discretion.|$|R

You <b>'ll</b> <b>attack</b> [...] Perhaps this new position--but I 'm right; [...] Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:-- [...] He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark [...] Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower 3 is a {{survival}} horror game played from a fixed third-person camera perspective in which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. Clock Tower 3 {{is the first}} game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, {{as opposed to the}} point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies ("Subordinates"). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> Alyssa if she approaches them. In order to pacify them, an item of sentimental value must be found and returned to the spirit's corpse.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E
50|$|Physical Attack Rings possess three Hit Areas {{coupled with}} Strike Areas. By hitting {{all of the}} hit areas, the {{character}} <b>will</b> perform three <b>attacks.</b> If any of the hit areas are missed, the character’s turn will be skipped or their amount of <b>attacks</b> <b>will</b> be reduced depending on which hit area is missed. If the first hit area is missed the turn is automatically skipped. If the player hits the first hit area but misses the subsequent hit areas, the amount of <b>attacks</b> <b>will</b> be reduced.|$|R
5000|$|I {{will not}} {{infringe}} on the Church in any way. I will not hurt a cleric or a monk if unarmed. I will not steal an ox, cow, pig, sheep, goat, ass, or a mare with colt. I <b>will</b> not <b>attack</b> a vilian or vilainesse or servants or merchants for ransom. I {{will not take}} a mule or a horse male or female or a colt in pasture from any man from the calends of March to {{the feast of the}} All Saints unless to recover a debt. I will not burn houses or destroy them unless there is a knight inside. I will not root up vines. I <b>will</b> not <b>attack</b> noble ladies traveling without husband nor their maids, nor widows or nuns unless it is their fault. From the beginning of Lent to the end of Easter I <b>will</b> not <b>attack</b> an unarmed knight.|$|R

5|$|He also attacks Wei {{in campaigns}} masterminded by Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang gains Jiang Wei {{as a general}} after {{isolating}} him and tricking Wei general Ma Zun into thinking that he was betraying him, in a clever ploy at the Battle of Tianshui ("Tales"). He proceeds to defeat the Wei after a failed prisoner exchange at the Battle of Mt. Dingjun and saves Ma Su from defeat at the Battle of Jieting. His final battle with Wei is at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains, where he fakes his death, only to ambush the Wei forces and defeat Sima Yi. If Wu has fallen before Wei, Shu <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> Xuchang, the co-capital of Wei, and take it, with Wei's officers fighting to the death.|$|E
5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
5|$|Karnan later saves princess Subhangi from an {{uncontrolled}} chariot, {{and they}} fall in love. Subhangi's parents initially disapprove of their romance, but eventually they accept, {{and the couple}} get married. A few years later, Krishna, {{a supporter of the}} Pandavas, learns about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first son whom she abandoned. Karnan gets to know about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack any of her sons (the Pandavas) except Arjuna during the impending Kurukshetra War, and that he <b>will</b> <b>attack</b> Arjuna with the Nagastra weapon only once. Karnan refuses to join his brothers, the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhana.|$|E
