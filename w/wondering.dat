40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the use of}} <b>wonder</b> in the TV-series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage (1980). Popular {{science has}} been studied extensively (e. g. Broks 2006; Leane 2007; Perrault 2013), and <b>wonder</b> has been studied moderately (e. g. Daston & Park 1998; Fuller 2006; Vasalou 2015). However, {{there are very few}} studies of <b>wonder</b> in popular science. This paper explores how and why <b>wonder</b> is used in Cosmos, with the wider aim of understanding uses of <b>wonder</b> in popular science. The studies that discuss <b>wonder</b> in popular science (Fahnestock 1986; Perrault 2013) argue that <b>wonder</b> is used to enthuse the audience about science, but they do not discuss why <b>wonder</b> has this ability, nor whether <b>wonder</b> has other functions. This paper argues that Fuller's (2006) psychological and evolutionary account of <b>wonder</b> can elucidate why <b>wonder</b> has the ability to enthuse; it discerns three senses of ‘wonder’ (related to objects, emotions and attitudes); and it discusses other functions of <b>wonder</b> (existential, aesthetic and ethical). Due to the centrality of astrobiological questions in Cosmos, this paper also highlights the relation of these questions to the senses and functions of <b>wonder</b> in Cosmos...|$|R
