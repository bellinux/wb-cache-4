The garnet, {{as it is}} mined and collected, is crushed to finer grains; all pieces which are larger than 60mesh (250micrometers) are normally used for sand blasting. The pieces between 60mesh (250micrometers) and 200mesh (74micrometers) are normally used for <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>cutting.</b> The remaining garnet pieces that are finer than 200mesh (74micrometers) are used for glass polishing and lapping.

Where the normal axes on a water jet are named Y (back/forth), X (left/right) and Z (up/down), a 5-axis system will typically add an A axis (angle from perpendicular) and C axis (rotation around the Z-axis). Depending on the cutting head, the maximum cutting angle for the A axis can be anywhere from 55, 60, {{or in some cases}} even 90 degrees from vertical.

This {{paper has}} developed a three dimensional finite element model of <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet</b> assisted <b>cutting</b> {{in order to understand}} the influence of its cooling and lubricating effect on cutting process. The cooling effect of <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet</b> is modeled with a convective heat transfer coefficient. A window with the temperature and the heat transfer coefficient of <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet,</b> which can move at the same speed as the tool, has been defined on the tool face so as to continuously simulate cooling process of the cutting zone under <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet</b> condition. Friction contact between tool and chip is modeled by a constant shear model. The shear friction factor with different values has been set to study the influence of lubricating effect of <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet.</b> Simulation results show that compared with its cooling effect, the lubricating effect of <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet</b> is more effective to reduce cutting force and tool temperature. A further improvement in the lubricating effect of <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet</b> also results in an obvious reduction in cutting force and tool temperature. The findings obtained in this study may provide helpful information for developing <b>water</b> vapor <b>jet</b> assisted <b>cutting</b> process...|$|R

40|$|Methods of {{improvement}} {{in the performance of}} mechanical rock cutting systems are continually being sought. One area being investigated is combining mechanical rock <b>cutting</b> tools with <b>water</b> <b>jets.</b> In this ‘hybrid’ arrangement, the mass breakage mechanism of a rolling disc cutter or drag pick is coupled with the concentrated energy medium of a high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> Research has indicated that the resultant improvements in performance of mechanical cutting tools could be due to the cutting of the rock surface through fracture and erosion thereby ameliorating the rock breakage process of the mechanical cutting tool. Damage by a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> has been observed even in rock of high strength. This paper outlines a study on the sole use of <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> in <b>cutting</b> rock and the effects of changes in the principal variables of a <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> An understanding of the characteristics and the relative importance of any changes in these variables is necessary to optimise the cutting performance of a hybrid system in terms of advance rate and energy expenditure. The variables considered in the study included nozzle diameter, water pressure, traversing speed and multiple passes of a <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> Within the range of values studied for each variable, a change in water pressure was found to have the greatest impact on the level of surface damage in rock. Traversing speed, {{and to a lesser extent}} nozzle diameter, were also found to alter the magnitude of surface damage in rock...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{principle}} deficiencies of the abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> (AWJ) <b>cutting</b> process is wavy striations on the generated cut surface in relatively thick workpieces. A desirable surface finish can be obtained only when {{the thickness of the}} workpiece is less than the depth of the smooth zone. Due to the limitation of the waterjet pressures from the current pumping technology, minimisation of striations without the sacrifice of the cutting speed and so increasing the smooth zone depth would constitute a marked improvement in the AWJ machining. In this study, different nozzle oscillation cutting techniques were developed to optimise the AWJ machining process. A comparative study was conducted using different surface texture parameters among straight cutting and different oscillation cutting methods under the same input cutting parameters. Detailed analyses of the cutting results indicate that a significant enhancement in the cut surface quality was obtained by using the controlled cutting nozzle oscillation techniques...|$|R
