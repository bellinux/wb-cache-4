5|$|In recent decades, {{substantial}} numbers of central European birds have taken to <b>wintering</b> in gardens in Great Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, where the blackcap was formerly just a summer visitor. Although the British climate is sub-optimal, compensatory factors include the ready availability of food, (particularly from bird tables), a shorter migration distance, and the avoidance of the Alps and the Sahara Desert. These <b>wintering</b> birds come from Germany, and isotope analysis (which enables the <b>wintering</b> location to be determined) showed that the German birds <b>wintering</b> in Britain tend to mate only among themselves, and do not usually interbreed with those <b>wintering</b> in the Mediterranean or western Africa. This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps <b>wintering</b> around the Mediterranean, and form pairs before the southern birds arrive. Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction, which would take them into the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5|$|Long {{distance}} migrants {{are believed}} to disperse as young birds and form attachments to potential breeding sites and to favourite <b>wintering</b> sites. Once the site attachment is made they show high site-fidelity, visiting the same <b>wintering</b> sites year after year.|$|E
5|$|Other {{significant}} areas include stop-over sites {{between the}} <b>wintering</b> and breeding territories. A capture-recapture study of passerine migrants with high fidelity for breeding and <b>wintering</b> sites {{did not show}} similar strict association with stop-over sites.|$|E

5|$|While <b>wintering,</b> {{bald eagles}} {{tend to be}} less habitat and {{disturbance}} sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or <b>wintering</b> bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland <b>wintering</b> habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.|$|E
5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} {{start their}} {{return from the}} <b>wintering</b> grounds in February or March, but northern breeders do not reach their breeding areas until April or early May. This monogamous species nests mainly from mid June to July.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} gregarious on migration, {{travelling}} in large flocks that can contain {{hundreds or thousands}} of individuals. Huge dense groups form on the <b>wintering</b> grounds; one flock in Senegal contained a million birds. A minority winter further east to Burma, south China, New Guinea and scattered parts of southern Australia, or on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. In Great Britain and parts of coastal western Europe, where the breeding and <b>wintering</b> ranges overlap, birds may be present throughout the year. Non-breeding birds may also remain year round in the tropical <b>wintering</b> quarters. The Ruff is an uncommon visitor to Alaska (where it has occasionally bred), Canada and the contiguous states of the US, and has wandered to Iceland, Middle America, northern South America, Madagascar and New Zealand. It has been recorded as breeding well south of its main range in northern Kazakhstan, a major migration stopover area.|$|E

5|$|The American {{black duck}} is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, <b>wintering</b> and breeding populations.

5|$|The corn crake is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} African crake on the <b>wintering</b> grounds, {{but can be}} distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern. In flight, it has longer, less rounded wings, and shallower wingbeats than its African relative, and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing. In both the breeding and <b>wintering</b> ranges {{it is unlikely to}} be confused with any other rails, since sympatric species are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. A flying corn crake can resemble a gamebird, but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|The male, {{which plays}} {{no part in}} nesting or chick care, leaves the {{breeding}} grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all <b>wintering</b> ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. Many migratory species use this differential <b>wintering</b> strategy, since it reduces feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds as early as possible, improving their chances of successful mating. Male ruffs may {{also be able to}} tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.|$|E
5|$|The {{two members}} of the {{subfamily}} have geographically separate ranges. The African river martin breeds along the Congo and Ubangi rivers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is migratory, <b>wintering</b> in coastal savannah in southern Gabon and the Republic of Congo; it has recently been discovered to nest in beach ridges and grassland in its coastal <b>wintering</b> areas. The white-eyed river martin is known only from its <b>wintering</b> site at Bueng Boraphet lake in Thailand, where it was seen between the months of November and February. It may be migratory, but its breeding grounds and habitat are unknown, although river valleys in Northern Thailand or south-western China are possibilities, as are Cambodia and Myanmar. However, doubts have been cast on whether it is actually migratory at all.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in <b>wintering</b> areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate.

5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or <b>wintering</b> ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser striped swallow has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles moult their head, {{body and}} some wing {{feathers}} {{a few weeks}} after fledging, and adults have a complete moult after breeding. In both cases, if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the <b>wintering</b> grounds.|$|E
5|$|Male blackcaps will {{sometimes}} sing even when incubating, {{especially with the}} second brood. This appears to be intended to maintain the bond with the female. <b>Wintering</b> birds in Africa are quiet initially, but start singing in January or February prior to their return north.|$|E
