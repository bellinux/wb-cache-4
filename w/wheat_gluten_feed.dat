40|$|Low-density diets {{might help}} to reduce hunger feeling in restricted-fed broiler breeders. Effects of low-density diets on {{nutrient}} digestibility and bird development were studied in Cobb 500 broiler breeder hens from 4 wk of age until {{the onset of the}} lay (wk 26). The experiment included 4 treatments. The control treatment was a normal density diet (ND; 2, 600 kcal/kg). Treatments 2 and 3 had a 12 and 23 % lower nutrient density than ND (LD 12 and LD 23, respectively) through inclusion of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> <b>feed,</b> and sunflower seed meal. Treatment 4 also had a 12 % lower nutrient density than ND but included oats and sugar beet pulp (LD 12 OP). Total daily intake of energy, digestible lysine, calcium, retainable phosphorus, sodium, and linoleic acid was kept constant in the low-density dietary treatments. Animal performance and development of the intestinal tract and reproductive tract were determined in addition to digestibility and feed passage rate. The LD 12 OP provided a lower AME and nutrient digestibility than calculated and was related to lower live weights. Birds given LD 23 and LD 12 OP showed a faster ovarian and oviduct development between wk 24 and 26 compared with ND. At 22 wk of age, LD 23 and LD 12 OP diets resulted in higher empty jejunum and ileum weights. Low-density diets did not affect intestinal tract contents and decreased mean retention time of the contents. It was concluded that low-density diets can affect live weight and development of digestive and reproductive tracts...|$|E
40|$|Effects of low-density broiler breeder diets on {{offspring}} {{performance and}} mortality were studied using 2, 100 female and 210 male Cobb 500 breeders. Breeder treatments involved 4 experimental groups and {{a control group}} with normal density diets (ND, 2, 600 kcal of AME/kg during rearing and 2, 800 kcal of AME/kg during laying). In treatment 2, nutrient densities were decreased by 12 % (LD 12) and 11 % (LD 11) during the rearing and laying periods, respectively, whereas in treatment 3, nutrient densities were decreased by 23 % (LD 23) and 21 % (LD 21) during the rearing and laying periods, respectively. The nutrient density in these treatments was decreased through inclusion of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> <b>feed,</b> and sunflower seed meal in the diets. Treatment 4 included diets with the same nutrient densities as in treatment 2 but included oats and sugar beet pulp (LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP). In treatment 5, the same low-density diet {{was given to the}} breeders as in treatment 2 during the rearing period, but it was followed by a normal density diet during the laying period (LD 12 -ND). Treatments were applied from 4 to 60 wk of age. On low-density diets, offspring showed an increased 1 -d-old weight. As compared with offspring of breeders that received ND, the d 38 live weight of chickens from 29 -wk-old breeders fed LD 11 was improved. Mortality was reduced in offspring from 60 -wk-old parent stock given low-density diets. The IgM titers in 35 -d-old offspring from eggs with a lower-than-average weight were reduced when 29 -wk-old broiler breeders were fed low-density diets. In offspring from eggs with a higher-than-average weight from 60 -wk-old parent stock given LD 11 or LD 21 diets, IgM titers were higher compared with ND. It was concluded that low-density broiler breeder diets can improve offspring growth rates, reduce mortality, and reduce or increase immune responses, depending on breeder age and egg weight...|$|E
40|$|Restricted {{feeding of}} broiler breeders is {{required}} to obtain good reproductive performance. Current practical feed restriction levels can result in hunger feeling and chronic stress, particularly during the rearing period. On the basis of literature data, low-density diets might improve bird welfare. Recent findings also indicate that low-density broiler breeder diets can reduce offspring mortality. In this thesis, effects of low-density breeder diets on bird welfare and breeder and offspring performance were evaluated. Breeder treatments involved: 1) normal density diets (ND), 2) diets with 12 and 11 % reduced nutrient densities during rearing and laying (LD 12 and LD 11), 3) diets with 23 and 21 % reduced nutrient densities during rearing and laying (LD 23 and LD 21), 4) as 2), but with oats and sugar beet pulp instead of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and sunflower seed meal in the diets (LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP), and 5) LD 11 diets during rearing followed by ND diets during laying. Feeding LD 23 diets reduced stereotypic pecking behaviour and increased time spent on sitting {{during the first half}} of the rearing period. LD 23 and LD 12 OP diets reduced feed intake motivation during rearing. It was concluded that LD 23 can improve bird welfare {{during the first half of}} the rearing period. However, LD 21 impaired bird welfare during laying. LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP diets gave significantly lower live weights during rearing and laying. Low-density diets delayed reproductive tract development at 24 weeks of age, which was followed by an increased development between week 24 and 26. Changes in bird development were related to changes in nutrient digestibility and utilization of digested nutrients. Egg weights and amount of egg white increased and embryonic development was improved on low-density diets. Laying percentage was significantly higher on LD 11 diets. LD 11 diets increased live weight of offspring of 29 -week-old breeders significantly in comparison with ND diets. Low-density breeder diets resulted in a significant reduction in offspring mortality when breeders were 60 weeks of age. Antibody titres in offspring indicated that nutrients in eggs with a relatively low weight were used for growth rather than for immune system development. It was concluded that low-density broiler breeder diets can improve offspring performance and offspring vitality...|$|E

The liver enzyme activities were measured from blood (ALT, AST, ALP and GMT). Significantly different values for methods DPPH, and ABTS, FR were proved by male chickens that were fed by the wheat Konini. The male chickens fed by the wheat Konini generally had lower activity of liver enzymes, but significant difference was in GMT activity in the male chicken's blood.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the nutritional value of processed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> for early-weaned pigs. The first experiment involved 72 weanling pigs with an avg age of 20 d and avg wt of 9. 2 lb. Six diets were fed to the pigs in individual metabolism cages. Protein sources were casein, flash-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> two solubilized <b>wheat</b> <b>glutens,</b> and soybean meal. Response criteria were N digestibility, biological value, and N retention. Casein had greater N digestibility, biological value, and N retention than the other protein sources. The <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> products had greater N digestibility than soybean meal. Modification of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> to increase its solubility, resulted in marked decreases in biological value and N retention. Experiment 2 was a nursery growth assay. A total of 180 pigs were used, with an avg age of 25 d and avg wt of 12. 3 lb. The five pelleted diets fed from d 0 to 14 were: 1) a high nutrient density diet (HNDD) with 20 % dried whey and 20 % dried skim milk (DSM); 2) HNDD with the DSM replaced by flash-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 3) HNDD with the DSM replaced by spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 4) HNDD with the DSM replaced by solubilized-modified <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 5) HNDD with DSM replaced by soy protein isolate and lactose. All pigs were fed a common diet from wk 3 to 5 of the experiment. No differences in ADG or ADFI were noted for d 0 to 14.

40|$|Biocomposites {{developed}} from <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> using water without any chemicals as plasticizer and jute fibers as reinforcement have much better flexural and tensile properties than similar polypropylene composites reinforced with jute fibers. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is an inexpensive and abundant co-product derived from renewable resources and is biodegradable but non-thermoplastic.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{environmental concern}} has reawakened {{an interest in}} materials based on renewable resources as replacement for petroleum-based materials. The main objective of this thesis was to explore plant proteins, more specifically <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> as a binder in wood adhesives intended for typical solid wood applications such as furniture and flooring. Alkaline and acidic dispersions of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> were used as wood adhesives to bond together beech wood substrates. Soy protein isolate {{was used as a}} reference. The tensile shear strengths of the substrates were measured for comparison of bond strength and resistance to cold water. AFM in colloidal probe mode was used to investigate nanoscale adhesion between cellulose and protein films. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was divided into the two protein classes; glutenins and gliadins, and their adhesive performance was compared with that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> Heat treatment and mild hydrolysis were investigated as means for improving bonding performance of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> The treated <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples were analysed by SE-HPLC and 13 C-NMR to correlate molecular size distribution and structural changes with bonding performance. Soy protein isolate is superior to <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> especially in regards to water resistance. However, the bond strength of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is improved when starved bond lines are avoided. The AFM analysis reveals higher interfacial adhesion between soy protein isolate and cellulose than between <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and cellulose. These results partly explain some of the differences in bonding performance between the plant proteins. Soy protein isolate contains more polar amino acid residues than <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and possibly interacts more strongly with cellulose. Furthermore, the bond performances of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and glutenin are similar, while that of gliadin is inferior to the others, especially regarding water resistance. The extent of penetration of the dispersions into the wood material has a large impact on the results. The bonding performance of gliadin is similar to the others when over-penetration of the dispersion into the wood material is avoided. Moreover, the bond strength of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples heated at 90 °C was in general improved compared to that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> A small improvement was also obtained for some of the hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples (degree of hydrolysis: 0 - 0. 6 %). The improvements in bonding performance for the heat treated samples are due to polymerization, while the improvements for the hydrolyzed samples are due to denaturation.

First, the study provides {{an assessment of the}} environmental impact of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> powder production. The aim of this contribution is to provide a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten-based product. Second, the study evaluates wheat-gluten-based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polylactide (PLA) packaging film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production, incineration with energy recovery, and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. Such comparison offers insight in environmental benefits of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> over conventional plastic film as well as its bio-based alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the <b>wheat</b> cultivation and <b>gluten</b> drying phase are dominant in the majority of the 18 impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favorable from environmental perspective. It offers great benefits in climate change and fossil depletion over LDPE film and in 14 impact categories over PLA film.

Strategies that proved unsuccessful in improving resistance to ruminal degradation included use of the cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase; induction of a Maillard reaction; and increasing the time of heating film forming solutions.

40|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> can be hydrolyzed {{by either}} using (vital) <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> or {{directly}} from wheat flour. This study investigates {{the influence of}} the presence of starch, the main component of wheat, on enzymatic <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> hydrolysis. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> present in <b>wheat</b> flour (WFG) and vital <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> (VWG) were hydrolyzed at constant protein concentrations, but subsequently 5. 6 times higher amounts of wheat flour. Nevertheless, WFG hydrolysis at 40 % total solids resulted in significantly higher degrees of hydrolysis (DH%) than VWG hydrolysis at 7. 2 % solids. This difference increased to up to 4. 5 % in 6 h and diminished again for longer reaction times. Possible differences in the gluten composition and the presence of albumins and globulins in wheat flour could not explain the difference in DH% because the addition of starch to VWG increased the rate of hydrolysis similarly. Instead, it was concluded that starch granules impede gluten aggregation, which facilitates the hydrolysis. At higher solid concentrations of up to 70 % wheat flour, the positive effect of starch disappeared, because WFG hydrolysis was hindered by mass transfer limitations and lower water activities...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine if a sphingolipid-enriched lipid fraction from <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> could affect the incidence of type I diabetes in BioBreeding diabetes prone (BBdp) rats. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was extracted with a chloroform-methanol (CM) mixture to isolate most of the lipids. Isolated lipids were subjected to silica gel column chromatography and saponification to remove most of neutral lipids and phospholipids, leaving behind a lipid fraction enriched in sphingolipids. This sphingolipid-enriched lipid fraction was used in a BBdp rat feeding study. BBdp rats were fed with one of five diets from weaning at 23 days of age until 125 days of age: a hydrolyzed casein based diet (HC), a NTP- 2000 standard rodent diet (NTP- 2000), a <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> based diet (WG), a sphingolipid-free <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> based diet (WGSLF), and a hydrolyzed casein plus sphingolipid-enriched lipid fraction diet (HC+SL). The yield of sphingolipid-enriched lipid fraction was about 0. 62 % of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> The content of glycosylceramide in sphingolipid-enriched lipid fraction was increased more than five fold compared to that in total isolated lipids.

40|$|A {{feeding trial}} {{evaluated}} {{the hypothesis that}} wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> would improve growth performance of cattle fed steam-flaked corn-based finishing diets and supply required degradable intake protein (DIP). The trial used 360 steer calves (initial BW = 288 ± 11 kg) housed in 36 pens for 166 d in an incomplete 4 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Pens of steers were assigned to treatments according to a completely randomized design (four replicates per treatment combination). Treatments were wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> (0, 20, 30, or 40 % of dietary DM) and CP (13. 0, 13. 7, or 14. 4 % of dietary DM) via supplemental urea as DIP. The 0 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> treatment included only the 13. 7 % CP diet, and the 40 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> treatment included only the 13. 7 and 14. 4 % CP diets. Final dietary DIP concentration was 9. 0 % for 0 % wet corn gluten feed; 8. 7, 9. 5, and 10. 2 % for 20 % wet corn gluten feed; 9. 0, 9. 7, and 10. 3 % DIP for 30 % wet corn gluten feed; and 10. 0 and 10. 6 % for 40 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed.</b> Hot carcass weight, ADG, DMI, and G:F responded quadratically (P ≤ 0. 05) to wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed.</b> The 20, 30, and 40 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> treatments increased ADG by 7, 6, and 3 % and increased DMI by 4, 5, and 5 %, respectively, relative to the 0 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> treatment. Feed efficiency was 102, 101, and 98 % of the 0 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> treatment for 20, 30, and 40 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed,</b> respectively. Hot carcass weight, ADG, and G:F increased linearly (P ≤ 0. 05) in response to increased DIP. Nonlinear analysis for DIP over the combined 20 and 30 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> treatments indicated a DIP requirement of 9. 6 % of DM for ADG and 9. 2 % of DM for G:F, corresponding to 14. 6 and 14. 3 % CP for 20 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and 14. 8 and 14. 5 % CP for 30 % wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed,</b> respectively. Fat thickness, marbling, LM area, and USDA yield grade were not affected (P = 0. 12 to 0. 99) by wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> or CP. These {{results show that the}} inclusion rate of wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> for maximizing ADG and G:F in steam-flaked corn-based finishing diets is approximately 20 % of DM.

40|$|A {{total of}} 472 {{weanling}} pigs (initially 13. 5 lb) {{were used in}} two experiments to evaluate the effects of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> source (WG) and combinations with spray-dried animal plasma (SDAP) on growth performance of nursery pigs. In Exp. 1, the five dietary treatments included a control diet containing 6 % SDAP, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> that was enzymatically hydrolyzed (Source 1), and a non-hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> (Source 2). The <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> sources replaced L-lysine HCl and replaced 50 % or 100 % of the spray-dried animal plasma. From d 0 to 7, 7 to 14, and 0 to 21, increasing <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> decreased (linear; P< 0. 05) ADG. There were no differences between <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> sources. Average daily feed intake decreased similar to ADG, with the exception that ADFI of pigs fed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> Source 2 had only a slight decreasing trend (P< 0. 11) from d 0 to 7. Pigs fed the diet containing 6 % SDAP had the greatest ADG and ADFI from d 0 to 21. When the SDAP was replaced with either <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> source, ADG and ADFI linearly decreased (P< 0. 01) but F/G improved (P< 0. 04). When pigs were fed the common diet from d 21 to 35, {{there were no differences}} (P< 0. 05) in ADG, ADFI or F/G. In Exp. 2, the six dietary treatments included a negative control with no SDAP or WG (0 : 0 ratio), 9 % WG (100 : 0 ratio), 6. 75 % WG and 1. 25 % SDAP (75 : 25 ratio) combination, 4. 5 % WG and 2. 5 % SDAP (50 : 50 ratio) combination, 2. 25 % WG and 3. 75 % SDAP (25 : 75 ratio) combination, and a positive control with 5 % SDAP (0 : 100 ratio). The <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> (Source 1) was enzymatically hydrolyzed, but from a different lot than Exp. 1. From d 0 to 14, pigs fed 6 % SDAP had numerically greater ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed the negative control diet. However, replacing SDAP with increasing amounts of WG tended to decrease (P< 0. 10) ADG and ADFI. These results confirm the improved ADG and ADFI of pigs fed SDAP immediately after weaning. In these experiments, replacing SDAP with WG resulted in decreased ADG...|$|R
