5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to <b>welding</b> <b>glass.</b> The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between <b>welding</b> <b>glass</b> and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. <b>Welding</b> <b>glass</b> is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

In order to determine the stability of the laser welded samples a three point bending test was used.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Colloid and Interface Science and the definitive published version is available at [URL] 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. Hypothesis: Reducing particle contaminations on solid and delicate surfaces is of great importance {{in a number of}} industries. A new non-destructive method is proposed, which is based on the laser-induced thermocapillary effect for the removal of micron size particles from surfaces. The cleaning mechanism is related to the surface-tension-driven flows produced by the laser heating of thin layer of a cleaning liquid deposited onto a surface contaminated with particles. Experiments: Focusing the laser irradiation into the line laser beam allowed using this method for a large-scale cleaning of surfaces. Hexadecane was used as a cleaning liquid to remove micron-sized polyethylene, Teflon, talc and Al 2 O 3 particles from surfaces of <b>welding</b> <b>glass,</b> carbolite and soft magnetic disc using the line beam of the IR laser. Findings: A good cleaning efficiency was achieved for cases of polyethylene and Teflon particles on both the complete wettable <b>welding</b> <b>glass</b> and the low-wettable soft magnetic disc, while in case of oleophilic talc and Al 2 O 3 particles the effectiveness of the cleaning method was lower on all three substrates investigated. The thermal influence of the laser irradiation on substrates used was measured with infrared camera. It was shown that temperature in the irradiated area during the long-time heating increases insignificantly and cannot cause any damage of the substrate...|$|E

Transforming this technology to the scale of building components would create an innovative tool with a high architectural potential. However, in construction industry such techniques are still in an experimental stage. In spite of several small successes that have been accomplished with e. g. the <b>welding</b> of <b>glass</b> for building applications [1], [2], a fundamental safety problem still needs to be soved: fused or <b>welded</b> <b>glass</b> is monolithic and brittle.

The purpose of the coatings is to form a safety film, which prevents shattering of the glass pieces and/or ensures a certain level of post-breakage strength and stiffness.

FreeGlass comprises a head-mounted display with an infrared range camera, both connected to a wearable computer. It {{is based on the}} MannGlas TM computerized <b>welding</b> <b>glass,</b> which embodies HDR (High Dynamic Range) and AR (Augmented/Augmediated Reality). FreeGlass recontextualizes the 3 D range camera as a sousveillance (e. g. cameras attached to people) camera.

Computer vision algorithms therefore benefit from the use of the range camera to allow image segmentation by using both the infrared and depth information from the device for 3 D hand gesture recognition system. The gesture recognition is then accomplished by using a neural network on the segmented hand. Recognized gestures are used to provide the user with interactions in an augmediated reality environment. Additionally, we present applications of FreeGlass for serendipitous gesture recognition in everyday life, as well as for interaction with real-world objects (with and without gesture recognition).
