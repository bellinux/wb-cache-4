500|$|The Killing Joke is a {{story about}} Batman and the Joker; it isn't about {{anything}} that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Paul Bettany was {{the first}} actor to portray two main {{characters}} within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Iron Man and Avengers films, and portraying Vision in Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War. Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought was fun for the MCU." [...] Feige added that Lee [...] "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} made without Twin Peaks series regulars Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, and Richard Beymer. At the time, these {{absences}} {{were attributed to}} scheduling conflicts, but in a 1995 interview, Fenn said that her real reason was that she [...] "was extremely disappointed {{in the way the}} second season got off track. As far as Fire Walk with Me, it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> chose not to be a part of." [...] In a 2014 interview, however, Fenn said that it was ultimately a scheduling conflict with Of Mice and Men that prevented her from committing to the film. Fenn's character was cut from the script, Moira Kelly was cast as Donna, and Beymer's scenes were not filmed. In a September 2007 interview, Beymer claimed that he did not appear in any scenes shot for the film, although his character, Benjamin Horne, appeared in the script.|$|E

He notes that [...] "belief in God didn't play {{a large role}} in my home, but a certain attitude to life and the living of it did". He followed this by stating, [...] "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that...</b> <b>I</b> was going to say it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. It was something to this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it."

2500|$|On January 3, 2001, the Redskins hired former Browns and Chiefs {{head coach}} Marty Schottenheimer as head coach. [...] The 2001 season {{began with a}} loss to the San Diego Chargers, 30–3, {{two days before the}} September 11, 2001, attacks. On September 13, 2001, the Redskins {{announced}} the establishment of the Redskins Relief Fund to help families of the victims of the attack at the Pentagon. During the course of the season, the Redskins raised more than $700,000. [...] They finished the season with an 8–8 record and Schottenheimer was fired after the final game. Snyder later said in a 2013 interview on the firing of Schottenheimer, [...] "I like Marty and still do to this day, we are good friends, he'd still be here if he didn't want to do it all. He was insistent on doing it all, that <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't think works, one guy can't do everything, he was a machine on that front.

[...] Lee filmed several different versions of the scene, including an alternative where he references his role in Deadpool, which would have been the first acknowledgment of the X-Men film series by an MCU film. Gunn later admitted that the Civil War reference is a continuity error, given Vol. 2 is set before the events of Civil War, saying, [...] "I screwed up; I wasn't thinking. But I'm going to say that probably Stan Lee used the guise of a Fed Ex guy more than one time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Tharros I Alitheia" [...] {{contains}} music {{written by}} Dimitris Kontopoulos, who {{she had first}} collaborated with for her second album, while the lyrics were written by Viki Gerothodorou, who had previously collaborated with Tamta for her self-titled debut album. Kontopoulos and Gerothodorou had both previously collaborated with the featured artist, Sakis Rouvas as of To Hrono Stamatao (2003) and Iparhi Agapi Edo (2006), respectively, and in collaboration have created his hits [...] "Ola Gyro Sou Gyrizoun", [...] "Stous 31 Dromous", [...] "+ Se Thelo", and [...] "Pio Dinata". Tamta first {{got in touch with}} Rouvas during the recording of his 11th studio album, Iparhi Agapi Edo in late 2006. She performed as the opening act at his Sakis on the Waves beach concert and the two eventually recorded a duet together, also written by Dimitris Kontopoulos, with MAD TV adding that the song's theme would provoke reaction. It was widely reported that the duet would appear on his new studio album, however a little before the release of Iparhi Agapi Edo, MAD TV reported that the track had been cut from the album with no explanation why. While at first it was unknown whether this new duet was indeed that song, it became apparent that it was not as in the aforementioned track Rouvas was the lead artist, as well as that this new track was recorded in 2009. Since 2006, the two artists did not find any further opportunity to collaborate until 2009, when Rouvas chose Tamta as his main supporting act for his winter 20092010 season concert series, eventually revealed to be at the newly renovated The S Club, where Rouvas is the owner. Thus, [...] "Tharros I Alitheia" [...] was also recorded in promotion of their shows. Tamta expressed how much she really wanted to collaborate with Rouvas: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted very much. Of course, many times not everything works out according to your own desires. Fortunately though this collaboration was materialized." [...] Tamta revealed that [...] "Tharros I Alitheia" [...] was a song that she liked very much.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not easy}} to make sure of such innocence as {{prompted}} this inquiry of my Altrurian friend. The doubt whether he could really be in earnest <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had already felt; and it was destined to beset me, as it did now, again and again. My first thought was that, of course, he was trying a bit of cheap irony on me, a mixture of the feeble sarcasm and false sentiment that makes us smile when we find it in the philippics of the industrial agitators. For a moment I did not know but I had fallen victim to a walking delegate on his vacation, who was employing his summer leisure in going about the country {{in the guise of a}} traveler from Altruria, and foisting himself upon people who would have had nothing to do with him in his real character. But in another moment I perceived that this was impossible. I could not suppose that the friend who had introduced him to me would be capable of seconding so poor a joke, and, besides, I could not imagine why a walking delegate should wish to address his clumsy satire to me particularly. For the present, at least, there was nothing for it but to deal with this inquiry as if it were made in good faith and in the pursuit of useful information. It struck me as grotesque; but it would not have been decent to treat it as if it were so. I was obliged to regard it seriously, and so I decided to shirk it.|$|E

60|$|I had {{a curious}} revulsion of feeling that morning of our meeting. (Of all places {{for such a}} clandestine {{encounter}} she had chosen the bridge opposite Buckingham Palace.) Overnight I had been full of self pity, and eager for the comfort of Isabel's presence. But the ill-written scrawl {{in which she had}} replied had been full of the suggestion of her own weakness and misery. And when I saw her, my own selfish sorrows were altogether swept away by a wave of pitiful tenderness. Something had happened to her that I did not understand. She was manifestly ill. She came towards me wearily, she who had always borne herself so bravely; her shoulders seemed bent, and her eyes were tired, and her face white and drawn. All my life has been a narrow self-centred life; no brothers, no sisters or children or weak things had ever yet made any intimate appeal to me, and suddenly--I verily believe {{for the first time in}} my life!--I felt a great passion of protective ownership; I felt that here <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could die to shelter, something that meant more than joy or pride or splendid ambitions or splendid creation to me, a new kind of hold upon me, a new power in the world. Some sealed fountain was opened in my breast. I knew that I could love Isabel broken, Isabel beaten, Isabel ugly and in pain, more than I could love any sweet or delightful or glorious thing in life. I didn't care any more for anything in the world but Isabel, and that I should protect her. I trembled as I came near her, and could scarcely speak to her for the emotion that filled me....|$|E
6000|$|It little {{mattered to}} me now that Mrs. Briss had put it to me--that I had even whimsically put it to myself--that I was perhaps in love with her. That was as good a name as another for an {{interest}} springing up in an hour, and was moreover a decent working hypothesis. The sentiment had not indeed asserted itself at [...] "first sight," [...] though it might have taken its place remarkably well among the phenomena {{of what is known}} as second. The real fact was, none the less, that I was quite too sorry for her to be anything except sorry. This odd feeling <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may as well say I shall not even now attempt to account for--partly, it is true, because my recital of the rest of what I was to see in no small measure does so. It was a force that I at this stage simply found I had already succumbed to. If it was not the result of what I had granted to myself was the matter with her, then it was rather the very cause of my making that concession. It was a different thing from my first prompt impulse to shield her. I had already shielded her--fought for her so far as I could or as the case immediately required. My own sense of how I was affected had practically cleared up, in short, in the presence of this deeper vision of her. My divinations and inductions had finally brought home to me that in the whole huge, brilliant, crowded place I was the only person save one who was in anything that could be called a relation to her. The other person's relation was concealed, and mine, so far as she herself was concerned, was unexpressed--so that I suppose what most, at the juncture in question, stirred within me was the wonder of how I might successfully express it. I felt that so long as I didn't express it I should be haunted with the idea of something infinitely touching and tragic in her loneliness--possibly in her torment, in her terror. If she was [...] "nervous" [...] to the tune I had come to recognise, it could only be because she had grounds. And what might her grounds more naturally be than that, arranged and arrayed, disguised and decorated, pursuing in vain, through our careless company, her search for the right shade of apparent security, she felt herself none the less all the while the restless victim of fear and failure? ...|$|E
