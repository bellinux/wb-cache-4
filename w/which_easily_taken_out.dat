Two boards of light wood are {{connected}} by bows of iron, 1 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick, with hooks inserted in either side, for the pack-bags to hook on to. The straps for the breastings, breechings, and girths, were screwed to the boards; the crupper passed through a ring on the after bow; and a light pad, <b>which</b> could <b>easily</b> be <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> to be re-stuffed, was secured by small thongs, passed through holes in {{the ends of the}} boards. We had two girths, which crossed each other under the horse. (In unloading, the neck-strap is unbuckled on the near side, also the breasting and girths; and the whole is drawn off behind.) ...|$|R

50|$|Deborah Sherman Gorelo- Lily: An {{orangutan}} {{and one of}} {{the minor}} protagonists for the animals' point of view. Despite being a female, she is something of a brute, as she can <b>easily</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> anyone (regardless as to whether they are friend or foe) with but one punch. Despite this, she is a softie deep down, as she does care deeply for her mate, Bombay, and will protect him to the end. Her shaggy haircut and dark fur help her to stick out amongst a crowd.|$|R
50|$|The plant grows next to two dams, the Narrows Dam and the Falls Dam. It {{is likely}} that these {{structures}} alter the normal flow regime of the river enough to constitute {{a threat to the}} species. The plant may depend on periodic flooding to scour competing vegetation out of its habitat. The dams prevent or reduce the frequency of these flooding events. Introduced species of plants may threaten the species, particularly mimosa (Albizia julibrissin), <b>which</b> <b>easily</b> <b>takes</b> hold in the local riverbank habitat.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuous}} flow-type hydrothermal reaction system, {{in which}} both temperature and pressure were rapidly and dynamically controlled, was constructed. It is called a real time high temperature and pressure reaction system (RT-HighTP). The RT-HighTP was hyphenated with liquid chromatograph (RT-HighTP-LC) to achieve prompt analysis of the reaction products. The RT-HighTP system produced stable pressure under the supercritical and subcritical phases (%RSD < 3 %). The RT-HighTP-LC was able to change the hydrothermal condition rapidly. The hydrothermal products under four conditions were analyzed within 70 min. Further, the hydrothermal products of lignin was <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> using the sample collecting loop and analyzed by an external instrument of GC/MS...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Skelewog Jr. (voiced by Dwayne Hill) - The son of Yin and Yang's {{part-time}} enemy, Roger the Skelewog. At first, Roger Jr. was a bully to Yin and Yang, having mock {{fights with}} Yang and teasing him and Yin, but, during [...] "Woofoogeddon", {{it was revealed}} he longed to be Yang's best friend. Roger Jr., being a prehistory-esque monster, has displayed super strength, such as when he <b>easily</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> {{a whole group of}} the Night Master's soldiers just by running by them with his arms. He can also breathe fire and launch spikes from his arms. In Season 2, he ultimately becomes friends with Yin, Yang and Lina.|$|R
50|$|Globin 2 - Globin 2 is notably {{inhabited}} by vampires. The planet is perpetually {{in black and}} white, reminiscent of the old horror films of vampires. There is a large castle, <b>which</b> is <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> by anyone who wishes to become a vampire in turn.|$|R

40|$|A {{new process}} for {{producing}} large bulk single crystals of benzil (C 6 H 5 COCOC 6 H 5) is {{reported in this}} paper. Good quality crystals have been successfully grown using this approach to crystal growth. This method {{seems to be very}} promising for other thermally stable NLO organic materials also. The entire contents vycor crucible 1. 5 inch in diameter and 2 inch deep was converted to single crystal. Purity of the starting growth material is also an important factor in the final quality of the grown crystals. The entire crystal can be very <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the crucible by simple maneuvering. Initial characterization of the grown crystals indicated that the crystals are as good as other crystals grown by conventional Bridgman Stockbarger technique...|$|R
50|$|On Planet Esmeralda, Belial's Legionoid Army {{is causing}} {{destruction}} and attacking {{a group of}} rebels {{who are trying to}} attack. Battling against the Legionoids are Nao and Run, two brothers who pilot a vehicle to do battle against the army. When Run tries to save Nao from falling into a volcanic pit, Ultraman Zero arrives and notices the situation the two are in. The bracelet proved to be useful as the suns in that universe are incapable of recharging Ultra beings. As a result, Ultraman Zero uses Run's body as his host and shortly after joining, Zero <b>easily</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> the Legionoids. However, in doing so Ultraman Zero is forced to assume the identity of Nao's brother, Run to both keep the heavily wounded Run alive as well as to conserve energy.|$|R

Robust processing is well-integrated into standard processing in this approach, requiring essentially only a single new BNF rule in the grammar. We describe the results of implementing this approach in two different domains. 1...|$|R
30|$|Another {{option is}} the {{combination}} of intramedullary nails or flexible hydroxyapatite (HA) coated wires with an external fixator {{that has been used}} for regenerated bone reinforcement, reduction of complication rate and duration of hospitalization [49, 50, 51]. The surgeons of the Centre introduced HA-coated intramedullary wires instead of a nail for these purposes [51]. A couple of such wires (diameter from 1.5 to 2.0  mm) is introduced from the medial and lateral sides at the metaphyseal long bone level and then pushed to the opposite metaphysis {{in such a way that}} the ray of their opposite curvature is about 40 °– 50 °. The wires do not compromise the bone marrow content and can be <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out.</b> It was proven both experimentally and clinically that such wires stimulate new endosteal bone formation and provide mechanical reinforcement and a faster period of treatment [34, 51].|$|R
5000|$|Richard {{claims to}} be {{traveling}} with Cale out of sheer boredom and for new opportunities to kill. He used to travel with a companion, an imp named Hctib Elttil (Little Bitch if read backwards), which ran away when it grew tired of being abused. In addition to his prodigious magical power, Richard was shown to be skilled enough in hand-to-hand combat to <b>easily</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> several trolls within seconds, and in one instance successfully defeating a bear while both of his arms had been removed (which he somehow attached the bear's arms to himself thus becoming a [...] "Bear-Lock".) Richard claims that he once drained {{the soul of a}} monk, which tasted like chocolate. [...] Richard has stated that he has been [...] "alive" [...] for hundreds of years. [...] During this time he had forgotten most of his previous life, though some memories are now returning and apparently changing him.|$|R
50|$|Much later, Anaconda {{took part}} in the Bloodsport tournament in hopes of winning the prize money. She <b>easily</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> her first opponent, Forearm, but got her neck slit by her second opponent, Puma. Her ability to heal quickly proved useful, as she survived the attack and {{returned}} to the Serpent Society for their mission to exact revenge on Diamondback once again. She then joined S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new espionage team, the Six Pack. She eventually turned on them, along with Constrictor, Solo, and Domino, to join forces with Cable, who was trying to create a sanctuary with his newfound powers. She was also warped into Cable's mind, where she saved Cable's life by grabbing onto him before he could get sucked into a techno-organic virus. She continued to work with the Six Pack as they committed acts of terrorism in Rumekistan to diminish Cable's reputation. Cable exacted revenge on the Six Pack by defeating them all and returning them to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Anaconda {{eventually}} became romantically involved {{with one of}} the new recruits, Puff Adder. They, along with Rock Python were sent to retrieve Diamondback, who had escaped her death sentence. They eventually crashed their Serpent Saucer into Diamondback's apartment, where she, Black Mamba, and Asp were hiding out. The girls were <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> by Anaconda and her allies, but their kidnapping attempt was interrupted by an invitation to join Superia's all-female villain group, the Femizons. Diamondback, Black Mamba, and Asp accepted, as did Anaconda, reluctantly. While on Superia's ship, Anaconda caused quite a ruckus with the villainess Quicksand. She also took part in the attack on Captain America and Paladin, but fled when the Femizons disbanded. [...] She reappeared with the Serpent Society when super hero undercover, Jack Flag, attempted to join the group to replace a retired Cobra. Anaconda battled Jack Flag and his partner Free Spirit until Force Works showed up {{and put an end to}} the battle.|$|R
60|$|This {{branch of}} trade, being so long principally {{managed by the}} Company's {{servants}} for the Company and under its authority, cannot be <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of their hands and pass to the natives, especially when {{it is to be}} carried on without the control naturally inherent in all participation. It is not difficult to conceive how this forced preference of traffic in a raw commodity must have injured the manufactures, while it was the policy of the Company to continue the trade on their own account. The servants, so far from deviating from their course, since they have taken the trade into their own management, have gone much further into it. The proportion of raw silk in the investment is to be augmented. The proportion of the whole cargoes for the year 1783, divided into sixteen parts, is ten of raw silk, and six only of manufactured goods. Such is the proportion of this losing article in the scheme for the investment of private fortunes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next major}} change came in 1907 when the Fe team began loading up with black American stars, such as Rube Foster, Home Run Johnson, Pete Hill, and Bill Monroe. [...] Soon {{the other teams}} were also {{bringing}} in the Negro League stars, culminating in the 1912 Habana, <b>which</b> <b>easily</b> <b>took</b> the title with a team featuring Hall-of-Famers Joe Williams, John Henry Lloyd, and Pete Hill, as well as Home Run Johnson and Cuban stars Julián Castillo, Carlos Morán, and Luis Padrón. [...] According to González Echevarría, [...] "These teams were clearly of major-league quality, combining the cream of Negro baseball with the best Cuba had to offer, and a few white major leaguers to boot." [...] Only Almendares was able to remain competitive for a while without American reinforcements, relying on its strong core of Cuban-born pitchers including Hall-of-Famer José Méndez, Eustaquio Pedroso, and José Muñoz.|$|R
50|$|The Finns were in {{a battle}} with the West Germans after two legs, but Josef Keck took three penalties, and left Finland with a big gap, <b>which</b> they <b>easily</b> <b>took</b> to a silver medal. East Germany had been floundering in 7th after three legs, as Frank Ullrich {{struggled}} with her shooting, taking four penalties. However, Manfred Geyer shot clear and had the second fastest leg overall, pulling them up past four teams to get the bronze medal.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} {{to enhance}} the solubilty of various poorly water soluble drugs and this enhancing the bioavailability throught uitilization of the SolEmuls®-technology has been achieved. It could be proven, that the SolEmuls®-technology is suited to transform a range of poorly water soluble drugs into biologically active and sufficiently long-term stable formulations. The advantages of the SolEmuls®-technology became obvious: easy formulation process, cost effective technology and easy scaling up ability. Apart from that, this work also showed the good usability for parenteral fat emulsions as drugcarriers, because of their extreme long-term stability (18 years). Even after a storage period of 18 years, the emulsions were still in general stable and of the appropriate particlesize. Although some of the emulsions showed signs of flocculation or sedimentation, which {{on the other hand}} could be <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the equation by filtering the emulsion, leaving a product still in the desired particle size range. Though the emulsions were no longer suitable for parenteral nutritions purposes, they remained well suited for use as drug carriers...|$|R
5000|$|Later that night, Teddy discovers Shiro's plan to kill {{everyone}} in the village the next day, but is found out and attacked. He struggles back to their base of operations so his friends will know and says how the [...] "elephant" [...] is not really an elephant. Although New Den-O is without his partner and Yuto is still injured, Momotaros decides to get Ryotaro back {{even if it is}} the last thing he does. The next day, the other Tarōs and Deneb battle the mercenaries as Momotaros fights his way to Yuuki, attempting to call out of Ryotaro to fight his possessor before getting a mortal wound from Yuuki to his friends' horror. But at the last second, Ryotaro regains control as Momotaros enters his body and drives the Ghost Imagin out of him. Assuming Climax Form, Den-O <b>easily</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> the Ghost Imagin as Shiro takes the Yuuki Belt and assumes Yuuki Hijack Form as he uses his necromancy to summon every Imagin the Riders have ever faced back from the dead.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the time}} came to groom a {{successor}} for the king, {{there seemed to be no}} suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: [...] "You are the rightful king and we must ask you to come with us to the palace." [...] Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, [...] "I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root." [...] The stick he carried, was of chopo or black poplar, <b>which</b> <b>easily</b> <b>takes</b> root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid.|$|R
50|$|Greg Hoffman is {{sworn in}} as {{replacement}} mayor and expresses his distrust of Gordon as Commissioner. Terry struggles to maintain his social, academic, and family life due to his duties as Batman. While talking to his mother about his situation, Dusk's killer appears on television and demands Batman {{to meet him at}} the offshore rig alone, threatening to overload other people's cell phones for every minute he doesn't show. On the rig, Terry is seemingly pitted against the original Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, and Robin. However, he breaks the illusion and finds three of his recurring foes (Spellbinder, Shriek, and Inque) with the unknown criminal that killed Dusk. Batman <b>easily</b> <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> his familiar foes, but the electrical powers of the fourth villain are too much and nearly kill him. The criminal calls himself Rewire and boasts to the GCPD that he killed Batman. Dick shows up at the rig and saves Batman from Rewire's hands and rescues the rest of the police while Rewire recharges with Ghoul's assistance. Ghoul provides Rewire with a toxin that fuels his power. When Dick returns to his jet ski, he finds Batman missing.|$|R

50|$|Rohrbach’s {{own name}} {{seems to have}} sprung from the bulrushes (Rohrkolben in German) and reeds (Schilfrohr) that once grew in {{abundance}} along the brook (Bach). These gave the brook its name, Rohrbach. This theory is easy to believe, for the lower valley of the Rohrbach is quite marshy and boggy, with soil in <b>which</b> such plants <b>easily</b> <b>take</b> root and grow. Later, the village was named after the brook.|$|R
50|$|In the {{darkness}} beneath Cavendish Hall - which is {{revealed to be}} an Aztec temple - Rasputin begins lecturing Hellboy {{on the nature of}} the Ogdru Jahad, and their desire to be free from their prison. Hellboy quickly becomes impatient and shoots Rasputin in the head, but the monk quickly heals and utters a curse which sends Hellboy flying through the air. This worries the demon, as this means his cadre of charms, amulets, relics, etc. are no use against Rasputin's power. The wizard warns Hellboy that he brought him into the world, and he can just as <b>easily</b> <b>take</b> him <b>out</b> of it. The Olafssen frog monster then returns, and begins battling anew with Hellboy.|$|R

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is among the}} most significant biogeochemical cycles on Earth because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all forms of life. The largest contributor of nitrogen in the cycle is atmospheric dinitrogen (N_ 2), which is generally unavailable to plants by direct assimilation. Hence, access to fixed forms of nitrogen constitutes in many cases the most limiting factor for plant growth. This is in sharp contrast to carbon, <b>which</b> is <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> up by plants from the atmosphere by fixing gaseous carbon dioxide (CO_ 2). The availability of nitrogen (and water) hence limits the ability to produce sufficient crops to feed our planet’s growing population...|$|R
