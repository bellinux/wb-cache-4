25|$|The planet Venus has {{a surface}} that is 90% basalt, {{indicating}} that volcanism {{played a major}} role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from <b>what</b> <b>scientists</b> can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.|$|E

500|$|Myxobolus cerebralis has a two-host {{life cycle}} {{involving}} a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm {{known to be}} susceptible to M. cerebralis infection is Tubifex tubifex, though <b>what</b> <b>scientists</b> currently call T. tubifex {{may in fact be}} more than one species. [...] First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the gut lumen of the worm, the spores extrude their polar capsules and attach to the gut epithelium by polar filaments. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many amoeboid cells by an asexual cell fission process called merogony. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.|$|E
500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} led him {{to notice}} <b>what</b> <b>scientists</b> such as Edward Bagnall Poulton {{were just beginning to}} describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures. A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints in shadows on the body itself. The top of an animal's back, facing the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, but he had not realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E
500|$|Some {{argue that}} <b>what</b> <b>scientists</b> {{do is not}} {{inductive}} reasoning at all but rather abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, {{it is not always}} clear what is meant by the [...] "best explanation." [...] Ockham's razor, which counsels choosing the simplest available explanation, thus {{plays an important role in}} some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this heuristic principle more precise in terms of theoretical parsimony or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.|$|E

Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm et al.

It distorts <b>what</b> <b>scientists</b> mean by confirmatory evidence." [...] Hyman wrote the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for psi. Storm et al. published a response to Hyman claiming the ganzfeld experimental design {{has proved to be}} consistent and reliable but parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention so further research on the subject is necessary. Rouder et al. in 2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm et al.'s meta-analysis reveals no evidence for psi, no plausible mechanism and omitted replication failures.
