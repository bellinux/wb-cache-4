Stoppard acknowledges that around 1982 he {{moved away from}} the [...] "argumentative" [...] works and more towards plays of the heart, as he became [...] "less shy" [...] about emotional openness. Discussing the later integration of heart and mind in his work, he commented [...] "I think I was too concerned <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> off, to have a firework go off every few seconds... I think I was always looking for the entertainer in myself and I {{seem to be able to}} entertain through manipulating language... it's really about human beings, it's not really about language at all." [...] The Real Thing (1982) uses a meta-theatrical structure to explore the suffering that adultery can produce and The Invention of Love (1997) also investigates the pain of passion. Arcadia (1993) explores the meeting of chaos theory, historiography, and landscape gardening.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, briefly known <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> eyes upon him." [...] Again Klok-No-Ton hesitated. [...] "Have {{there been}} gossips from other places?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|And what in {{the world}} was there to excite me? Nothing, or so little that it will seem ludicrous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> it down.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> out {{to come to}} thee, I was {{a walking}} rainbow; yet I was coxcomb enough to think thou wouldst {{overlook}} it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dennis's {{policy was}} mine, {{as you may}} have observed. You saw, for instance, how <b>I</b> fell <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>set</b> upon. <b>I</b> made no resistance. I did nothing to provoke an outbreak. Oh dear no!' ...|$|R
60|$|Alm. I'll to the king, {{and make}} it my request, Or my command, {{that you may be}} releast; And make you judge, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>set</b> you free, Who best deserves your passion, I, or she.|$|R
60|$|Aca.

60|$|Then, to {{complete}} Philip's disgust he said, 'I took with me my aunt's blessing <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> out; {{let me take}} yours with me also, reverend Mother.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aye, {{it was to}} {{save her}} that I drew. She was beset by these night walkers. See, she rises! They threw her down <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> upon them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rushed on me just as much. How was I to know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> {{to work on}} {{molecular}} physics that the business would bring me here--of all places?" ...|$|E
60|$|WHAT I {{am going}} to tell you, gentlemen, {{happened}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a very young man, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was just <b>setting</b> up in business on my own account.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir,' said Berenger, {{advancing}} {{into the}} hall, 'I know not {{the meaning of}} this. I am peacefully traveling with a passport from the King, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am <b>set</b> upon, no warrant shown me, my faithful servant slain, myself and my brother, an English subject, shamefully handled.|$|R
6000|$|... "It dropped <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>setting</b> out the others, took root, {{and looked}} so pretty and {{comfortable}} that I left it. These waifs sometimes {{do better than}} the most carefully tended ones: I only dig round them a bit and leave them to sun and air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] {{said the}} Office Seeker, [...] "you see before you {{the wreck of}} an ambitious man--ruined by the pursuit of place and power. This morning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> out from the {{national}} capital--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you knew}} the coercion,' muttered Gilbert. 'I protest, as I would to my dying day, that I had no {{intention}} of going near the stables <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> out, and would never have consented could I have helped it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{ever was}} more true," [...] said Flora. [...] "I read it over some little time ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> my papers in order, and {{understood}} it then. I never did before. I {{used to think}} it very good for the others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What was Jim Wickenden gettin' at <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said he'd <b>set</b> his stack {{too near}} anigh the brook?' Jabez dropped his voice. 'He {{was in his}} mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so! At any rate, {{she is not}} conventional. Why, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>set</b> {{free from}} my school at Paris, and married Bob three months later, I hadn't three ideas in my head beyond horses and balls and soldiers. It has all come with life and reading, my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is not in}} your proces. I do {{not know}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> shall be <b>set</b> free, but some who wish {{me out of this}} world will go from it before me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tain't {{much use}} for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing," [...] cried Silver. [...] "But now, you look here: you're young, you are, but you're {{as smart as}} paint. I see that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> my eyes on you, and I'll talk to you like a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! even I have my {{knowledge}} of the law. I know that it completely overlooked me as long as I respected it.

60|$|I {{have little}} {{notion of the}} real {{magnitude}} of these difficulties <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> about my task; but I am consoled for my pains and anxiety by observing {{that none of the}} multitudinous criticisms with which I have been favoured and, often, instructed, find fault with me on the score of having strayed out of bounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wot are ye comin' to ME for? I ain't runnin' your school," [...] he {{said slowly}} and aggressively. [...] "I started Providence all right for it mornin' afore last, since <b>when</b> <b>I</b> never <b>set</b> eyes on him. That lets ME out. My business, young feller, is lookin' arter the ranch. Yours, I reckon, is lookin' arter your scholars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So we are here. I am {{out of my}} depth. Like the bee, I was mad {{with the}} sight of so much joy, such a blue space, and now I shall find no footing to alight on.

6000|$|... 'That's a contradiction,' said Clara, laughing; 'here's busy little Kitty, {{who never}} is {{thoroughly}} happy {{but when she}} thinks she is useful, and I am child enough {{to be of the}} same mind. I never was unhappy but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>set</b> to enjoy myself. It has been the most beautiful day of my life. Thank you for it. Goodbye!' ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{no shame}} in my heart <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> it down that we ran from the enemy, and did our level best at that game; the order to retreat had been given after we had done all {{that might have been}} {{expected}} from well seasoned troops, and to have remained longer would have been a useless sacrifice.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} little clouds {{had begun to}} gather in the sky, so that the night was darker {{than it had been}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> out, and as we came to the end of Hog alley I {{believed}} it safe to stop there an instant in order to regain my breath, for now both captive and captor were breathing heavily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Eh? {{then she}} won't be {{fit for the}} 30th, poor child! tell me how it was, make haste. I heard it from Mr. Burnet as I came down to dinner. We have a dozen people at dinner. I {{told him not to}} mention it to my mother, and rode off to hear the truth. Make haste, half the people were come <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> off.' ...|$|E
60|$|I was now led, {{with the}} same {{precautions}} against noise, into the little bow-windowed dining-room of the cottage. The shutters were up, the lamp guiltily turned low; the beautiful Flora greeted me in a whisper; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>set</b> down to table, the pair proceeded {{to help me with}} precautions that might have seemed excessive in the Ear of Dionysius.|$|R
6000|$|... "The letter, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read it, <b>set</b> my {{mind off}} in a new direction. It surprised, it puzzled, it {{interested}} me. I thought, and thought, and thought of him, {{all the rest of}} the day.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{extraordinary}} what bad luck I have," [...] he said, one day. [...] "I almost always win {{at the beginning}} of the evening; and then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get thoroughly <b>set,</b> my winnings are swept away." ...|$|R
