500|$|The {{director}} also attributed Akeelah's low-esteem {{and doubt}} {{on her own}} capacities to the public school system, where she is bullied and [...] "her intellectual curiosity is kind of crushed". As such, Akeelah is portrayed as [...] "undermotivated student", who [...] "nwilling to be stigmatized as a freak or a brainiac," [...] avoids showing her abilities. According to Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe, the film shows [...] "the contradiction gifted students feel in an inhospitable environment." [...] Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post opined that Akeelah's sentence [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to represent a school that doesn't even have doors on the toilets?" [...] is [...] "one of the film's many subtle critiques of the country's education policies." [...] Writing in the English Journal, Amanda L. Hodges said it suggests a new approach on teaching with the [...] "50,000 coaches" [...] part; she declared it deconstructs the image of teachers [...] "as those who keep order and disseminate knowledge" [...] and shows that [...] "eaching {{is not an isolated}} activity that begins and ends at the classroom door." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Ike & Tina Turner were {{inducted}} to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Phil Spector later accepted {{on their}} behalf. That same year, the ex-couple signed away {{their rights to}} have their lives dramatized in the semi-autobiographical film What's Love Got to Do with It, later released in 1993 and starring Angela Bassett as Tina and Laurence Fishburne as Ike, with the actors receiving Best Actress and Best Actor Academy Award nominations for their portrayals of the former husband-and-wife team. Turner contributed to the soundtrack for What's Love Got to Do with It, re-recording songs from her Revue days and recording several newer songs, including {{what turned out to}} be her last Top 10 U.S. hit, [...] "I Don't Wanna Fight." [...] Other than helping Bassett with her wardrobe and teaching her dance steps as well as providing songs for the soundtrack, and appearing as herself at the end of the film, she refused to be involved fully in the film, telling an interviewer, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to see Ike Turner beat me up again? I haven't dwelled on it; it's all in the past where it belongs." [...] Following the film's and soundtrack's release, Turner embarked on her first US tour in seven years. Following the tour's end, Turner moved to Switzerland and took a year off from the road at the end of the tour.|$|E
500|$|Soap opera {{commentator}} Jenn Bishop {{said she}} {{found it difficult to}} explain Todd's popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, it is understandable that others would be as well. [...] "If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I'd say he's an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities," [...] she said. [...] "His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn't want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> any woman to have any sort of relationship with him." [...] Instead of seeing Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of [...] "an anti-anti-hero" [...] and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. [...] "While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn't leave {{a lot of room for}} rewrites," [...] Bishop commented. [...] "For example, Luke's rape of Laura on General Hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a 'seduction.' There was no 'grey area'. This [...] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue." [...] To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, [...] "was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another" [...] and [...] "ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can't help but like".|$|E

2500|$|A Democrat, Lee ran for {{governor}} in 1995 but dropped out before the primary. He famously said, [...] "why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be governor when I can be king?"

He also endorsed Bobby Jindal for Governor in 2003, his bid for Congress in 2004, 2006 reelection and again {{for governor}} in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Manzon's {{role was}} {{originally}} intended {{for one of}} the most prominent European actors, Lino Ventura. Despite Ventura's concerns about his English, he also initially approved Friedkin's proposal. However, after McQueen backed out, Ventura was hesitant to take part in the movie. Mastroianni was still interested but had problems related to his daughter's custody after his separation from Catherine Deneuve, which eventually made him decline the director's offer. After the disagreement with McQueen, Friedkin approached Robert Mitchum who, despite appreciating the script, sternly declined, asking Friedkin [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go to Ecuador for two or three months to fall out of a truck? I can do that outside my house." [...] Another candidate for Scanlon's role was Warren Oates, but since the movie's budget escalated beyond $10 million, the studio decided that [...] " [...] name wasn't big enough to carry that big a picture." [...] They eventually worked together on Friedkin's follow-up to Sorcerer, titled The Brink's Job.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} from {{the winter of}} 2010 to 2011 at Kalevankatu 45 in Helsinki, Finland, where Palomo was living for four weeks. Palomo primarily wrote the album using a Voyetra-8, a Korg MS-20 and a modified Commodore 64, and the first weeks of production in Helsinki involved him learning this equipment. Palomo first saw the Voyetra-8 in the music video for New Order's [...] "The Perfect Kiss", {{saying that he was}} amazed by its appearance: [...] "It's this bizarre, kaleidoscope interface with these knobs, and it's really physical to use, a strange kind of challenge". Palomo's songwriting on Era Extraña was more influenced by his live performances than his previous projects, and he claimed that he had never expected to perform his songs live before. He said, [...] "It was an influence; not so much something that limited me, but a feeling that lead to longer, more soundscape-driven songs. That was something that was undeniably in my mind: 'What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be playing every night for eight months?' And the album evolved from there".|$|E
2500|$|Ian Beale {{has gone}} on to be the longest running {{character}} in the soap's history and, until the returns of Sharon Watts in August 2012, Kathy Beale in February 2015 and Michelle Fowler in December 2016, was the only remaining original character. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to leave when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not going to get the same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office there are going to be people who don't get along but you get on with it and on the whole I enjoy it. Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good." ...|$|E
