In his 1999 autobiography , Foley said that [...] "Flair <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it". This was in reference to how poorly Foley thought he was booked during his WCW career when Flair was on the booking committee. Flair responded in his autobiography by writing: [...] "I do not care how many thumbtacks Mick Foley has fallen on, how many ladders he's fallen off, how many continents he's supposedly bled on, he will always {{be known as a}} glorified stuntman". However, they have reconciled and are now friends.|$|E
2500|$|After an {{appearance}} on the music TV program The Tube, Atlantic Records approached the band and signed it. Atlantic {{was one of the}} labels that had turned Twisted Sister down in the Club Days period. The band's first LP under Atlantic, You Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll, produced by Stuart Epps, was released in 1983 and included the UK No. 19 hit [...] "I Am (I'm Me)". From a production standpoint, the album sounded better than its predecessor, and it <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> heavy. Upon the success of the album the company decided to promote the band more heavily. A music video was made for the title track of You Can't Stop Rock'n'Roll, which was to become {{the first of a series}} of comedic videos that popularized the band.|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand run chase <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> {{exciting}} {{as it had}} been in the first match. [...] Nathan Astle followed up his 70 runs in the first match with just 11, beaten by the bowling of Australian speedster Brett Lee. Sinclair was the next to go, scoring 17 runs before edging a Jason Gillespie ball to Hayden in the slips. This was the beginning of a New Zealand collapse, with Scott Styris the next to depart with 5 runs, and then Stephen Fleming who had successfully taken on Lee, scoring 34 runs from 44 balls, falling to Brad Hogg's first delivery, given out LBW. Jacob Oram then fell for two runs, followed by Hamish Marshall for just 9, the latter falling victim to a quick ball from Lee which took his off stump.|$|E

2500|$|Other friends, publishers, {{and acquaintances}} held {{different}} views of Highsmith. Editor Gary Fisketjon, who published her later novels through Knopf, said that [...] "She was very rough, very difficult...But she was also plainspoken, dryly funny, and great fun to be around." [...] Composer David Diamond met Highsmith in 1943 and described her as being [...] "quite a depressed person—and I think people explain her by pulling out traits like cold and reserved, when in fact it all came from depression." [...] J. G. Ballard said of Highsmith, [...] "The author of Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mr. Ripley <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> deviant and quirky as her mischievous heroes, and didn't seem to mind if everyone knew it." [...] Screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, who adapted The Price of Salt into the 2015 film Carol, met Highsmith in 1987 and the two remained friends {{for the rest of}} Highsmith's life. Nagy said that Highsmith was [...] "very sweet" [...] and [...] "encouraging" [...] to her as a young writer, as well as [...] "wonderfully funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having toured in England in 1896 {{with the}} visiting team from Haverford, Scattergood's {{first-class}} cricket debut came against Gloucestershire on the Philadelphian's 1897 tour of England. Gloucestershire won the match by an innings and 26 runs. In the first innings, Scattergood achieved his high score of 13 and batted for 5 not {{out in the}} second innings. He made one catch to dismiss Charlie Townsend. Scattergood played three more matches on this tour {{before returning to the}} United States to play visiting side from England. Scattergood also joined the Philadelphians on their tour of England in 1903. He played through the middle of the tour and ended his first-class career with a match against Worcestershire on July 13–15. Unfortunately, Scattergood was injured shortly after taking the field and replaced. This was the end of a very successful career. The English cricketer Gilbert Jessop declared that [...] "the wicket-keeping of Scattergood <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> remarkable as was the bowling of Bart King." [...] John Lester wrote that the keeper's [...] "services to cricket extended far beyond his play. Always a defender of the faith, and one of those who strove hardest to stem the decline, he is still an influence in keeping it alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|But he {{was also}} sure that Oldbuck's {{greatest}} resemblance was to his own author, and this view has been widely accepted by modern critics. [...] Scott's pursuit of antiquities <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> enthusiastic as Oldbuck's, and he could easily have said with the laird of Monkbarns “My great-great-great-grandfather – it's a shame to the English language {{that we have not}} a less clumsy way of expressing a relationship of which we have occasion to think and speak so frequently.” [...] A particular obsession of Scott's was the tracking down of Border ballads, which he edited in The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and likewise Oldbuck was “a diligent collector of these scraps of ancient poetry”. [...] In later years Scott repeatedly compared himself to Oldbuck when discussing his antiquarian pursuits in his letters. [...] The two men were equally capable of being taken in by fraudulent impositions on their credulity, as when Scott accepted the fake ballad “Barthram’s Dirge” and a manufactured Latin legend about a spectre knight from his friend Robert Surtees. [...] They were also equally prone to buying land purely for its historical associations, Scott being in the process of completing his acquisition of the entire wide-ranging site of the battle of Melrose while he was writing The Antiquary. [...] Oldbuck’s preference for publishing his scholarly papers and the proposed notes for Lovel's Caledoniad anonymously or pseudonymously recall the fact that The Antiquary, like all the earlier Waverley novels, first appeared without Scott's name. [...] Both men were careful in their daily expenditure, yet generous to others. [...] Scott gave to his creation many of his own family circumstances, legal training, and experiences in love, with the young Oldbuck's rejection by Eveline Neville echoing quite closely Scott’s own by Williamina Belsches, even to the retreat into antiquarianism as a distraction from his sorrows. [...] John Sutherland has suggested that the name of Oldbuck's house, Monkbarns, is analogous to that of Scott’s new home Abbotsford. [...] Scott and his brainchild took opposite sides in politics – [...] Oldbuck being a Whig, Scott a Tory – and many critics have been surprised at the defence of the French Revolution Scott allows Oldbuck to voice, but it has been claimed that Oldbuck's views on this question are identical with those expressed by Scott in his Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Revolution being for both of them a historical necessity. [...] A. N. Wilson believed that if Scott had continued to quietly cultivate his friendships and {{the life of the mind}} like Oldbuck, rather than indulging a folie de grandeur like Wardour's, he would have died a happier man.|$|E

60|$|She did not {{see that}} Hewet kept looking at her across the gangway, between the figures of waiters hurrying past with plates.

They had quarrelled over the service, which <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> fine as Sappho, according to Hewet; so that Hirst's paganism was mere ostentation. Why go to church, he demanded, merely in order to read Sappho? Hirst observed that he had listened to every word of the sermon, as he could prove if Hewet would like a repetition of it; {{and he went to}} church in order to realise the nature of his Creator, which he had done very vividly that morning, thanks to Mr. Bax, who had inspired him to write three of the most superb lines in English literature, an invocation to the Deity.|$|E
6000|$|The whole {{party had}} {{gathered}} to the windows, while the discourse was proceeding, and looking out, each individual saw Mike and his friend, {{in the situation}} described by Maud. The two amateurs-- connoisseurs would not be misapplied, either--had seated themselves at {{the brink of a}} spring of delicious water, and removing the corn-cob that Pliny the younger had felt it to be classical to affix to the nozzle of a quart jug, had, some time before, commenced the delightful recreation of sounding the depth, not of the spring, but of the vessel. As respects the former, Mike, who was a wag in his way, had taken a hint from a practice said to be common in Ireland, called [...] "potatoe and point," [...] which means to eat the potatoe and point at the butter; declaring that [...] "rum and p'int" [...] <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> entertaining as a [...] "p'int of rum." [...] On this principle, then, with a broad grin on a face that opened from ear to ear whenever he laughed, the county Leitrim-man would gravely point his finger at the water, in a sort of mock-homage, and follow up the movement with such a suck at the nozzle, as, aided by the efforts of Nick, soon analyzed the upper half of the liquor that had entered by that very passage. All this time, conversation did not flag, and, as the parties grew warm, confidence increased, though reason sensibly diminished. As a part of this discourse will have some bearing on what is to follow, it may be in place to relate it, here.|$|E
60|$|A more awful or grander night {{than that}} I never remember. I'm a {{scientific}} man, and my {{business is to}} watch and report upon volcanoes; but that night, I confess, <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> hot as I care to have it. Anything hotter than that, indeed, would fry one like a herring. By nine o'clock, the mountain was in full glare; by ten, it was pouring out red fragments of stone and showers of ashes; by eleven, a stream of white glowing lava was pushing its way in one desolating flood down the ravines on the southern slope of the mountain. Before the final outburst, light curling wreaths of vapour ascended from fissures in {{the wall of the}} crater, and hung like a huge umbrella over the mountain top. The red glare, reflected from this strange cloud-like canopy, gave the whole scene for many miles around the appearance of being lighted up by giants at play with some vast and colossal Bengal fires. We looked on awestruck. Suddenly, and without the slightest warning, a sound reached our ears, a terrific sound, as of ten thousand engines blowing off steam; and all at once a great body of gas was ejected into the air, in a blaze of light, while huge fragments of rock were hurled violently upward, only to fall again in fiery heat upon the naked slopes of the cone and shoulders. All night long we were positively bombarded with these aërial shells; they fell in thousands round us on every side, though fortunately none of them happened to touch either the house itself or any one of its inhabitants.|$|E
