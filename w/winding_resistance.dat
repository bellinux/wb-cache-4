50|$|An ideal {{inductor}} {{would have no}} resistance or energy losses. However, real inductors have <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> from the metal wire forming the coils. Since the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> appears as a resistance in series with the inductor, it is often called the series resistance. The inductor's series resistance converts electric current through the coils into heat, thus causing a loss of inductive quality. The quality factor (or Q) of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and {{is a measure of}} its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal, lossless, inductor. High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and receivers. The higher the Q is, the narrower the bandwidth of the resonant circuit.|$|E

50|$|When an {{electric}} motor, AC or DC, is first energized, the rotor is not moving, and a current {{equivalent to the}} stalled current will flow, reducing as the motor picks up speed and develops a back EMF to oppose the supply. AC induction motors behave as transformers with a shorted secondary, until the rotor begins to move, while brushed motors present essentially the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance.</b> The duration of the starting transient is less if the mechanical load on the motor is relieved until it has picked up speed.|$|E
50|$|Common-mode chokes, {{where two}} coils are wound {{on a single}} core, are useful for {{prevention}} of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) from power supply lines and for prevention of malfunctioning of electronic equipment. They pass differential currents (equal but opposite), while blocking common-mode currents. Magnetic fields produced by differential-mode currents in the windings tend to cancel each other out. Thus, the choke presents little inductance or impedance to differential-mode currents. This also means the core will not saturate even for large differential-mode currents and the maximum current rating is instead determined by the heating effect of the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance.</b> Common-mode currents, however, see a high impedance due to the combined inductance of the windings.|$|E

5000|$|This {{example is}} {{slightly}} simplified (no gears between the motor and the load) {{from the control}} system for the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at the McDonald Observatory. [...] In the figure there are three feedback loops: current control loop, velocity control loop and position control loop. The last is the main loop. The other two are minor loops. The forward path, considering only the forward path without the minor loop feedback, has three unavoidable phase shifting stages. The motor inductance and <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> form a low-pass filter with a bandwidth around 200 Hz. Acceleration to velocity is an integrator and velocity to position is an integrator. This would have a total phase shift of 180 to 270 degrees. Simply connecting position feedback would almost always result in unstable behaviour.|$|E
50|$|One case of voltage {{regulation}} is in a transformer. The unideal {{components of the}} transformer cause a change in voltage when current flows. Under no load, when no current flows through the secondary coils, Vnl is given by the ideal model, where VS = VP*NS/NP. Looking at the equivalent circuit and neglecting the shunt components, as is a reasonable approximation, one can refer all resistance and reactance to the secondary side and clearly see that the secondary voltage at no load will indeed be given by the ideal model. In contrast, when the transformer delivers full load, a voltage drop occurs over the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance,</b> causing the terminal voltage across the load to be lower than anticipated. By the definition above, {{this leads to a}} nonzero {{voltage regulation}} which must be considered in use of the transformer.|$|E
50|$|One factor {{often not}} taken into {{consideration}} when discussing CDI spark energy is the actual energy provided to the spark gap versus the energy applied to the primary side of the coil. As a simple example, a typical ignition coil may have a secondary <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> of 4000 ohms and a secondary current of 400 milliamperes. Once a spark has struck, the voltage across the spark gap in a running engine drops to a relatively low value, {{in the order of}} 1500-2000 volts. This, combined {{with the fact that the}} coil secondary current of 400 milliamperes loses approximately 1600 volts through the 4000 ohm secondary resistance means that fully 50% of the energy is lost in heating the coil secondary. Actual measurements show the real world efficiency to be only 35 to 38% when coil primary winding losses are included.|$|E

50|$|Some triathlon bikes use 650c wheels (a nominal {{diameter}} of 65 centimeters) {{rather than the}} conventional 700c wheels used on nearly all road bikes. The smaller wheels weigh less, have a smaller cross-sectional area (reducing <b>wind</b> <b>resistance),</b> and reduce the overall <b>wind</b> <b>resistance</b> of the bicycle by bringing the frame and cyclist closer to the ground. A potential drawback is that the smaller diameter means a higher curvature at the tire's contact patch, which increases rolling resistance. Which effect is more prominent depends on the cyclist and the windiness and steepness of the course.|$|R

5000|$|For 60 Hz operation, the IE2 and IE3 minimum {{full-load}} efficiency {{values are}} virtually {{identical to the}} North American National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) [...] Energy Efficient and Premium Efficiency motor standards, respectively. (NEMA does specify different full-load efficiency values for motors with Totally Enclosed Fan-Cooled and Open Drip-proof enclosures and from 200HP IEC IE3 efficiency is slightly higher than NEMA Premium Efficiency). The IEC minimum full-load efficiency standards are higher for 60 Hz motors than for 50 Hz motors. This is because {{as long as the}} motor torque is constant, I2R or <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> losses are the same at 50 Hz and 60 Hz. The motor output power, however, increases linearly with speed, increasing by 20% when the frequency is increased from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. In general, the 60 Hz efficiency is about 2.5% to 0.5% greater than the 50 Hz values. The efficiency gain is greater for smaller motor power ratings.|$|E
50|$|The winding {{specifications}} affect motor performance the most. Changing {{the number}} of turns per slot or the diameter of magnet wire produces results that differ greatly from each other. Environmental temperature affects the magnetic forces of magnets and the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance,</b> and so indicates changes in motor performance. Changing anisotropic magnets from wet to dry results in decreasing stall torques and increasing no-load speed due to the magnetic force being weakened. Magnets are held in a housing for their full capability, while using a thin-wall housing will result in magnetic force leaking through the housing wall. That is where magnet yokes are used to prevent magnetic leakage, thus maintaining the full capacity of the magnets. Phase refers to positional relations between the center line of each polar magnet and the switching position of commutator segments and brushes. Lagging in phase causes inefficiency, electrical noise, and shortened life. To avoid these situations, improved motors are assembled with forward brush-shifting that offsets the armature reaction during load operation to keep them on neutral electrically.|$|E
50|$|L/R driver {{circuits}} {{are also}} referred to as constant voltage drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions. However, it is winding current, not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft. The current I in each winding is related to the applied voltage V by the winding inductance L and the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> R. The resistance R determines the maximum current according to Ohm's law I=V/R. The inductance L determines the maximum rate of change of the current in the winding according to the formula for an inductor dI/dt = V/L. Thus when controlled by an L/R drive, the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed, the voltage U will be changing faster than the current I can keep up. In simple terms the rate of change of current is L / R (e.g. a 10 mH inductance with 2 ohms resistance will take 5 ms to reach approx 2/3 of maximum torque or around 24 ms to reach 99% of max torque). To obtain high torque at high speeds requires a large drive voltage with a low resistance and low inductance.|$|E
