5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It is likely that the gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the outside <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> Memphis or Heliopolis, such an observation {{could only have been}} made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could only have taken place in 1517 BC. The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Methods of {{destroying}} suspected vampires varied, with staking {{the most commonly}} cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, {{with a record of}} oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
5|$|Pather Panchali did {{not have}} a script; it <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> Ray's {{drawings}} and notes. Ray completed the first draft of the notes during his sea voyage to and from London in 1950. Before principal photography began, he created a storyboard dealing with details and continuity. Years later, he donated those drawings and notes to Cinémathèque Française.|$|E

5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|The ball's {{design has}} been updated {{over the years}} to reflect {{improvements}} in lighting technology; the original design <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> wood and iron and lit with 100 incandescent light bulbs, while its current incarnation, designed by Harlem-based architectural lighting firm Focus Lighting, features a computerized LED lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangle-shaped crystal panels. Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop the building year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 is on display at Times Square's visitor center.|$|E

5|$|The {{western end}} of US2 took on two changes in the 1940s. M‑28 was {{extended}} along US2 to the state line at Ironwood from its western terminus at Wakefield. A similar extension <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> M‑28's eastern terminus to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948. The M‑54 designation was renumbered as Business US2 by 1945. The eastern M‑28 extension was reversed in 1950, and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952.|$|E
5|$|When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with {{currency}} {{notes on the}} occasion of the party's silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram’s birth anniversary on March 15, 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‘scandal’ on the presumption that the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and declaring that the garland of {{currency notes}} <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> money through corrupt means and not from donations of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed.|$|E

5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to {{a study published in the}} Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{supply was}} entirely by sea. Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, wearing Australian uniforms, {{advanced}} with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side {{as they were}} secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the sea. Once a beach was selected, a shore party was brought in by landing craft {{to set up an}} administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to be brought up by jeeps but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had to be brought by native carriers. Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks, or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be brought forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead.|$|E
