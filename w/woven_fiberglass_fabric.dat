40|$|A terpolyimide {{precursor}} {{was developed}} {{which can be}} foamed by microwave methods and yields foams possessing the best seating properties. A continuous process, based on spray drying techniques, permits production of polyimide powder precursors in large quantities. The constrained rise foaming process permits fabrication of rigid foam panels with improved mechanical properties and almost unlimited density characteristics. Polyimide foam core rigid panels were produced by this technique with <b>woven</b> <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> bonded to {{each side of the}} panel in a one step microwave process. The fire resistance of polyimide foams was significantly improved by the addition of ceramic fibers to the powder precursors. Foams produced from these compositions are flexible, possess good acoustical attenuation and meet the minimum burnthrough requirements when impinged by high flux flame sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experimental work described in this paper {{was to investigate the}} efficiency of GFRP composites in strengthening simply supported reinforced concrete beams designed with insufficient shear capacity. Using the hand lay-up technique, successive layers of a <b>woven</b> <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> were bonded along the shear span to increase the shear capacity and to avoid catastrophic premature failure modes. The strengthened beams were fabricated with no web reinforcement to explore the efficiency of the proposed strengthening technique using the results of control beams with closed stirrups as a  web reinforcement. The test results of 18 beams are reported, addressing the influence of different shear strengthening schemes and variable longitudinal reinforcement ratios on the structural behavior. The results indicated that significant increases in the shear strength and improvements in the overall structural behavior of beams with insufficient shear capacity could be achieved by proper application of GFRP wraps...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The boron-containing {{phenolic}} resin/high-silica <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> ceramifying composites {{were prepared}} using muscovite micas loaded boron-containing phenolic resin (BPF) as matrix, high-silica <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> as reinforcements. The boron-containing phenolic resin (BPF) reacted with the muscovite to form ceramic residue after thermal pyrolysis under high temperature.

Electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) was used to explore the changes in microstructure and local micro-chemical composition after samples were pyrolyzed under high temperatures. The ceramic yield of the composites ranged from 84. 39 % to 75. 23 % when pyrolyzed 700 to 1300 ℃ in air...|$|R

30|$|Another {{example of}} a fire {{resistant}} laminated fabric is an aluminum foil liner constructed of a very thin layer of aluminum sandwiched between a <b>woven</b> <b>fiberglass</b> and spun fiberglass. Since these types of barrier fabrics are quite thin and flexible, they do not impart stiffness to the upholstered product when placed between the fabric and the filling. Thin layers of FR PUF laminated or backcoated onto various textile substrates are in use as fire barriers in mattresses and upholstered furniture. Their major drawback is cost, {{as they can be}} an order of magnitude more expensive than other fire blocking technologies.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} automated composite fabric layup solution {{based on a}} new method to deform <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> referred to as shifting. A layup system was designed and implemented using a large robotic gantry and custom end-effector for shifting. Layup tests proved that the system can deposit fabric onto two-dimensional and three-dimensional tooling surfaces accurately and repeatedly while avoiding out-of-plane deformation. A process planning method was developed to generate tool paths for the layup system based on a geometric model of the tooling surface. The approach is analogous to Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining, where Numerical Control (NC) code from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model is generated to drive the milling machine. Layup experiments utilizing the proposed method were conducted to validate the performance. The {{results show that the}} process planning software requires minimal time or human intervention and can generate tool paths leading to accurate composite <b>fabric</b> layups. <b>Fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> samples processed with shifting deformation were observed for meso-scale deformation. Tow thinning, bending and spacing was observed and measured. Overall, shifting did not create flaws in amounts that would disqualify the method from use in industry. This suggests that shifting is a viable method for use in automated manufacturing. The work of this dissertation provides a new method for the automated layup of broad width composite fabric that is not possible with any available composite automation systems to date...|$|R
