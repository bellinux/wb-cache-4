25|$|Harlacher {{grew up in}} Camarillo, California, {{and started}} acting in school plays. When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, {{you could go to}} <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded {{that it was not a}} real job, and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and that she really got into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E

Concerning the argument of certain artists that the one who <b>works</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own present time can make contemporary art, this text seeks to explain the complexity of questions about this artistic “paradigm” through {{the reading of the}} book “The contingent object of contemporary art” written by Martha Buskirk.
