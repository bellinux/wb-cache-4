25|$|Zelena and Arthur are in {{the woods}} and come upon the witch’s home and is met by a giant wolf, only to have Zelena throws some {{sleeping}} powder on it to make it sleepy. The witch appears and says she won’t be as easy to subdue. Arthur asks for the magic helm and the witch says she already sent someone to look for it. Zelena holds her head near the cauldron and threatens her and the witch says Merida has it. Arthur is shocked that Merida escaped and Zelena promises to make her pay. They then show up with Zelena demanding it while Merida asks why everyone wants it. Arthur says it has the power to make other men fight your battle and says he needs it but Merida says her father wouldn’t use magic to fight his battles. Mulan says they need the helm to protect their people but they don’t have it. Zelena takes Merida's bow to use as a tracking device, and tells her she can console herself with the memories of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> ruler {{he turned out to be}} then tells Arthur they can use it to track the helm and they disappear.|$|E

500|$|Elisabeth's {{body was}} placed in a silver casket, a gift from Nicholas II, for the journey back to Darmstadt. Her father {{arranged}} a white funeral, with white instead of black for the funeral trappings, white flowers, and white horses for the procession. The Hessian people came out by the thousands to view the funeral procession and [...] "sobbed in unison so that I could hear it," [...] Ernst wrote. A cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, expressed shock at the child's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on 7 November 1903. [...] "How joyous and merry she was that day at Wolfsgarten, when I was there, so full of life and fun and health ... <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> heartrending blow for poor Ernie, who doted and adored that little enchantress!" [...] Elisabeth was buried in the Rosenhöhe {{with other members of the}} Hessian grand ducal family. A marble angel was later installed to watch over her grave. In a final gesture to Elisabeth and Ernst, Victoria Melita placed her badge of the Order of Hesse, granted to her upon her marriage, into Elisabeth's coffin. Ernst was still devastated by the memory of his daughter's death thirty years later. [...] "My little Elisabeth," [...] he wrote in his memoirs, [...] "was the sunshine of my life." ...|$|E

50|$|Labour {{was pushed}} into fourth {{place by the}} UK Independence Party on <b>what</b> was <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> night for them when they also failed to win the Blaenau Gwent {{by-election}}s. This was {{only the second time}} Labour had fallen to fourth place in an English by-election since World War II, the 1989 Richmond (Yorks) by-election being the other occasion and Labour would later drop to 5th place at the Henley by-election, 2008.|$|R
40|$|Performance artist Mark McGowan {{places a}} curse on London mayor Boris Johnson. "Boris Johnson {{needs to be}} sorted out no matter <b>what,</b> he's <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> man. How Londoners voted for him I will never know. I {{believe that there is}} no {{alternative}} but to put on a curse, which will hopefully get rid of him once and for all. This will not be a death curse, but a bad luck one. " - Mark McGowa...|$|R

2500|$|Loos, Emerson {{and fellow}} writer Frances Marion {{migrated}} to New York as a group, Loos and Emerson sharing a leased mansion in Great Neck, Long Island. Loos desperately wanted Marion as chaperone, as {{she found herself}} attracted to Emerson. He would readily admit that he [...] "had never been, nor could be, faithful to any one female." [...] Loos convinced herself that he would {{see that she was}} different from all his other girls, and that behind his outwardly dull exterior was a great mind. She would be wrong on both counts. She would later write: [...] "I had set my sights on a man of brains, to whom I could look up", she lamented, [...] "but <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> let down it would be to find out that I was smarter than he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of 2006, the Saturday show was moved to BBC Two during the BBC's experiment involving their Saturday morning line-up - BBC Two shows were moved to BBC One in return. The final episode was broadcast live on BBC Two on Saturday 11 March 2006. From {{the end of the}} previous Sunday and throughout the final episode they built up to the big finale, which involved all the cast members singing a song and getting covered in [...] "creamy muck muck". Then, for the first time ever, viewers were shown the outside of the bungalow, which subsequently collapsed under creamy muck muck before being kicked over by a giant foot. A final post-credits scene shows that the whole show was actually just a dream that the [...] "Big BBC Boss" [...] (Alan Yentob) was having, à la Newhart and The Brittas Empire. The episode ends with him waking up in bed and saying to the camera, [...] "Oh, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> dream!" [...] Dick and Dom then sit up either side of him and end the show with a theatrical cackle.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, Lucas {{announced}} that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller arthouse films. Asked whether the criticism he received following the prequel trilogy and the alterations to the re-releases of the original trilogy had influenced his decision to retire, Lucas said: [...] "Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the time and says <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> person you are?" [...] Despite insisting that a sequel trilogy would never happen, Lucas began working on story treatments for three new Star Wars films in 2011. In October 2012, The Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and {{announced that}} Star Wars Episode VII would be released in 2015. Later, it was revealed that the three new upcoming films (Episodes VII–IX) would be based on story treatments that had been written by George Lucas prior to the sale of Lucasfilm. The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy became president of the company, reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn.

On 24 June 1800, the ship's doctor sent Quarter Gunner William Dogget ashore {{to the hospital}} at Havana, the man suffering from a fever—later determined to be yellow fever. Ominously, Dogget's case signified {{only the beginning of}} <b>what</b> would become <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> ordeal for the sloop-of-war Warren.|$|R
60|$|Visitors, indeed, {{soon began}} to arrive; and {{it was more than}} a week before the curiosity of the crowd was at all satisfied. But even this did not bring <b>what</b> Roger {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> annoyance to <b>an</b> end; for the news had spread rapidly, through all the country round, of the strange white being who had come to Tabasco, and parties of visitors kept on arriving, some of them from a great distance.|$|R

6000|$|The steward awoke {{an hour or}} two later, {{and after}} <b>what</b> seemed <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{struggle}} found himself standing at the open door with the cold night air blowing in his face, and a voice which by an effort of memory he identified as that of Edward Silk inviting him [...] "to go home and lose no time about it." [...] Then the door slammed behind him and he stood balancing himself with some difficulty on the step, wondering what had happened. By the time he had walked up and down the deserted alley three or four times light was vouchsafed to him and, shivering slightly, he found his own door and went to bed.|$|R
5000|$|As we {{got close}} to the camp and saw <b>what</b> was inside... <b>a</b> <b>terrible,</b> terrible fear and horror entered our hearts. We thought, what is this? Where are we going?

Canadian airman Ed Carter-Edward's {{recollection}} of his arrival at Buchenwald.|$|R

On November 3, 2010, Pallone defeated Little by over 16,000 votes, 55% to 43% in <b>what</b> analysts considered <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> year for Democrats. However, {{for the first time}} in his career, Pallone failed to carry his home county of Monmouth.|$|R

60|$|Dorn {{leaped to}} his feet. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> thrilling and <b>terrible</b> sight! His comrades stood bareheaded, red faces uplifted, {{open-mouthed}} and wild with excitement, not daring to disobey orders and yell {{at the top}} of their lungs. Dorn felt, strong above the softened wonder and thought of a moment back, a tingling, pulsating wave of gushing blood go over him. Like his comrades, he began to wave his arms and stamp and bite his tongue.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>a</b> {{harsh and}} <b>terrible</b> cry from Hutchinson! He made one last convulsive effort and it doomed him. Slowly {{he lost his}} balance. Cordts's dark, evil, {{haunting}} face swung round. Both men became lax and plunged, and separated. The dust rose from the rough steps. Then the dark forms shot down--Cordts falling sheer and straight, Hutchinson headlong, with waving arms--down and down, vanishing in the depths. No sound came up. A little column of yellow dust curled from the fatal ledge and, catching the wind above, streamed away into the drifting clouds of smoke.|$|R
60|$|Egede {{soon found}} out <b>what</b> it was. <b>A</b> <b>terrible</b> murder had been {{committed}} the night before {{by one of the}} Eskimos, who was considered not only the best hunter of the band to which he belonged, but one of the best husbands and fathers. His name was Mangek. He {{was one of those who}} had been well disposed towards the missionary, and in regard to whom much hope had been entertained. But he had been treated to rum by the traders, and having conceived an ardent desire for more, had managed to obtain a keg of the mad water. Although kind and amiable by nature, his temperament was sanguine and his nerves sensitively strung. A very little of the rum excited him to extravagant exuberance of spirit, and a large dose made him temporarily insane.|$|R

6000|$|Justice, Justice: woe betides us {{everywhere}} when, {{for this}} reason or for that, we fail to do justice! No beneficence, benevolence, or other virtuous contribution will make good the want. And in <b>what</b> <b>a</b> rate of <b>terrible</b> geometrical progression, far beyond our poor computation, any act of Injustice once done by us grows; rooting itself ever anew, spreading ever anew, like a banyan-tree,--blasting all life under it, for it is a poison-tree!

Justice, Justice, {{in the name of}} Heaven; give us Justice, and we live; give us only counterfeits of it, or succedanea for it, and we die! ...|$|R

We beseech you to exercise your right and power to have regard to the merits of the case in order to prevent <b>what</b> might be <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> error of justice." ...|$|R
