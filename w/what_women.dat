5|$|Gibson {{starred in}} Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet in 1990, as the eponymous {{character}} of the Shakespearean tragedy of the same name. It was the first film produced by Icon Productions, a production company he co-founded with Bruce Davey. Gibson's directorial debut was The Man Without a Face (1993), an adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. Two years later he directed and produced Braveheart, a historical epic drama in which he also portrayed Sir William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish knight. The film earned him a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Gibson went on to star in Ransom (1996), Payback (1999), <b>What</b> <b>Women</b> Want and The Patriot (both in 2000), and We Were Soldiers (2002).|$|E

No doubt he was opposed to the writing of Bradstreet as well. These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men.|$|E

25|$|<b>What</b> <b>women</b> {{might have}} gained from {{cultivating}} devotions {{such as these}} has recently become a contentious matter. According to one school of thought, here lay an empowerment of women, both because the period’s cultural description of their bodies was preoccupied with blood and lactation and with nourishing in ways that implied a convergence between women and the salvific life-giving body of Christ (pouring out Eucharistic blood on the cross), and secondly because women were so constituted by their culture as subjected, powerless, suffering beings that they could ‘represent’ with particular force the suffering humanity of Christ.|$|E

Fairbanks was reportedly impressed by Vélez and quickly signed her to a contract and hired her {{to appear in the}} film with him.

In 2002, Gibson {{appeared}} in the Vietnam War drama We Were Soldiers and M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, which became the highest-grossing film of Gibson's acting career. While promoting Signs, Gibson said {{that he no longer}} wanted to be a movie star and would only act in film again if the script were truly extraordinary. In 2010, Gibson appeared in Edge of Darkness, which marked his first starring role since 2002 and was an adaptation of the BBC miniseries, Edge of Darkness. In 2010, following an outburst at his ex-girlfriend that was made public, Gibson was dropped from the talent agency of William Morris Endeavor.|$|E

25|$|Midler {{starred in}} her own sitcom in 2000, Bette, which {{featured}} Midler playing herself, a divine celebrity who is adored by her fans. Airing on CBS, initial ratings were high, marking the best sitcom debut for the network in more than five years, but viewers percentage soon declined, resulting in the show's cancellation in early 2001. Midler openly griped about the show's demanding shooting schedule, while the show itself was also reportedly rocked by backstage turmoil, involving the replacement of co-star Kevin Dunn whose departure was attributed to his behind-the scenes bickering with Midler by the media. However, Midler, critically praised, was awarded a People's Choice Award for her performance in the show and received a Golden Globe Award nomination the following year. Also in 2000, Midler made an uncredited cameo appearance in Nancy Meyers' fantasy rom–com <b>What</b> <b>Women</b> Want, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. In the film, she portrayed a therapist who realizes that central character Nick, played by Gibson, is able to understand women's thoughts. Released to generally mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Lara Croft's 1996 debut {{is often}} cited as a {{catalyst}} for more female leads in video games. Kaiser Hwang of PlayStation Magazine commented that she [...] "brought girl power" [...] to video games. IGN argued that Croft helped redefine gender in video games by providing a different interpretation of <b>what</b> <b>women</b> could do. Several publications have used her as the standard to which later female video game characters have been compared. Video game publications like PlayStation Magazine, IGN, Edge, and PlayStation: The Official Magazine have labelled the character a video game and cultural icon. Jeremy Smith credits Croft with exposing the Tomb Raider games and video games in general to a wider audience. Computer and Video Games commented that Croft's appearance on the cover of The Face signalled a change in the perception of video games from [...] "geeky" [...] to mainstream. The character is honoured in the British city Derby, previous home to Core Design.
