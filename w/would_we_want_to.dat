He played Josh Miller, a comedy writer, who [...] "transformed" [...] each episode into a character Miller has imagined, [...] "provid a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work". Production closed after five episodes and it was canceled after just two aired, due to poor critical reaction and ratings. Azaria later commented on the show: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} really truthful and interesting and impactful. We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that The Larry Sanders Show was our favorite thing on television, but we couldn't do it on NBC, and nor <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn't make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don't blame them at all. It was apparent it wasn't working." ...|$|E

If not, then according to Nozick {{there seems to be}} something wrong with hedonism, the view that pleasure and happiness are the primary or most important intrinsic goods and the proper aim of human life. Nozick's thought experiment has been widely debated since.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Noddy Holder {{spoke of the}} success in Belgium: [...] "What {{happened}} in Belgium was that Return to Base was available on import, and it started to climb the import charts. I don't know why, it {{was as much a}} surprise to us as it was to anybody. Warner Bros. Records then said to us, due to it starting to show some action, <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> release it over there as a major release. We thought [...] "why not?" [...] – and now it's the number one album over there!" [...] Speaking of [...] "I'm a Rocker", Holder said: [...] "That was the track getting the most airplay from the album. But it's not just a case of that applying in Belgium – we've had so many people writing to us asking why we've not released it as a single. [...] "I'm a Rocker" [...] is not even one of our songs though – it's a Chuck Berry number." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying [...] "that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do this?". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the [...] "Play Station", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.|$|E

What we really need is real Medicare cuts today for people who are already on the system." ...|$|E

Reid, upon being {{asked if he}} [...] "would support NIH funding to help even one child with cancer," [...] said [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that?"

However, when Disick asked Kourtney's opinion on marriage, she responded with [...] "if things are so good now... why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> change that?", so he did not propose. On July 8, 2012, Kourtney gave birth to their second child, daughter Penelope Scotland Disick. She was named after Scotland because of Kourtney's Scottish ancestry.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Lennon {{left the}} music {{business}} for several years. He followed his interests in cooking, sailing, and sculpting during his leave from the music industry. After he began his performing career there was occasionally unfounded media speculation that Julian would undertake performances with Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. However, in the Beatles Anthology series in 1996, the three surviving Beatles confirmed there was never an idea of having Julian sit in for his father as part of a Beatles reunion, with McCartney saying, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> subject him to all of this?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Chase also {{addressed}} {{the opinion of}} some that the open-ended finale was insulting to the show's longtime fans: [...] I saw some items in the press that said, [...] "This was a huge fuck you to the audience." [...] That we were shitting in the audience's face. Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that? Why would we entertain people for eight years only {{to give them the}} finger? We don't have contempt for the audience. In fact, I think The Sopranos is the only show that actually gave the audience credit for having some intelligence and attention span. We always operated as though people don't need to be spoon-fed every single thing—that their instincts and feelings and humanity will tell them what's going on.|$|E
5000|$|Monbiot {{also thinks}} that {{economic}} recession {{can be a}} good thing for the planet: [...] "Is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land, and should seek to stay there? Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse? Surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible?" [...] While he does recognize that recession can cause hardship, he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well. For example, the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth, but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2014, Jess Day, a Let Toys be Toys campaigner told UK {{newspaper}} the Daily Mirror: [...] "It's easy {{to dismiss}} toys as trivial, {{but this is}} one way we can help our children feel confident that they don't have to fit in with old-fashioned stereotypes. Labelling construction toys as boys’ toys and craft or dolls as girls’ toys restricts play. Play is important and different types toys help hone different skills. Telling girls that construction and science toys are for boys we limit what they think they can achieve before they've even had the chance to try it out. … There's nothing wrong with giving a girl a doll for Christmas, or a boy a car - but children need a variety of play. Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell them that only certain types of play are allowed for them? That sounds like the opposite of fun!” ...|$|E
50|$|John Heard later claimed an {{incident}} {{on the film}} led to him being unofficially blacklisted for a time.One afternoon when I was sitting there talking to another actor. I think it was Jay Patterson or somebody. I’m a Catholic, and I still hang around with guys I {{went to high school}} with... I leaned over and I said, “I don’t understand: Why in the world would they get a Jew to direct a Catholic boys movie?” And the director—Michael Dinner I think was his name—was sitting right behind me. Laughs. And then it turned out that I’m part Jewish! My grandfather was Jewish. I mean, it may have sounded like I was being anti-Semitic, but I was really just sort of being... Catholic boys are kind of vain. They think of themselves of being unique, so why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be directed by a Jewish person? But I probably didn’t work again after that for two years or something.|$|E
