5000|$|The {{company that}} Mendel and André {{operated}} {{during this period}} was called Industrial Contract Syndicate (Limited). In 1896 they created a company called Industrial Contract Corporation (Limited) with directors James Jackson (Chairman), Newton, Bailey and Burbidge. Mendel and André maintained control of the business by retaining founders' shares that gave them powers to override directors and shareholders. This new business became involved with the purchase and sale of a store in Clapham, London called Grice and Son. The purchase price was about £17,000 and the sale price £48,000. It transpired that the directors selling the business and those buying were the same individuals, {{but this was not}} declared on the prospectus nor was the profit they made from the deal. A dispute with the shareholder led to the prospects of a <b>winding-up</b> <b>procedure</b> in public court. This was avoided with a compromise agreed between the parties but Alfred Newton, who had just been elected Lord Mayor of London, asked for the case be re-opened so that the whole matter could be given a public hearing. [...] During the case, evidence was given that Mendel had written to several of the influential newspapers of the period, asking for favourable reviews of the flotation, and these letters were followed up with financial inducements.|$|E
40|$|LL. M. (Commercial law) This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explore the fundamental differences between the rights of employees in terms of windiqg-up procedures and that of business rescue proceedings. I will be specifically looking at each <b>procedure,</b> <b>winding-up</b> and business rescue proceedings, and the effect {{that each of these}} procedures have on the rights of employees. In terms of the analysis of the procedures, I will be looking at the history of both insolvency law and labour law, as well as a look at the old Companies Act of 1973 and specifically at judicial management. By looking at the history we can gain an outlook on the problems we encountered then and how they can be improved today. I will then move on to look specifically at the specific proceedings of winding-up in Chapter 14 of the old 1973 Act and Chapter 6 of the new 2008 for the provisions on business rescue. Through analysing the proceedings I will also look at the legal position in other jurisdictions on the specific matter into account. Specifically I will look to the UK and Australia. Additionally, I will be looking at the International Labour Organisations position on employees' rights in terms of insolvency law. The specific rights of employees that I will be considering are employees rights to commence proceedings, their right to be informed, their right to be consulted, the effect on their employment contracts, retrenchments, claims which they may have against the company as well as the specific rights of employees {{in the case of a}} transfer of the business. In analysing all of the above aspects, I will come to conclude from my findings that the rights afforded to employees under business rescue and Chapter 6 of the 2008 Act are extremely beneficial to the employees and are so extensive that they cover almost all rights of employees. In comparison with the rights afforded to employees' in terms of <b>winding-up</b> <b>procedures</b> under Chapter 14 of the 1973 Act these rights are stiII beneficial to employees but they are not as extensive. Both procedures afford employees a significant amount of protection...|$|R
