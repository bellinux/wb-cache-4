50|$|The <b>white-billed</b> <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> (Bubalornis albirostris) is a {{resident}} breeding bird species {{in most of}} Africa south of the Sahara Desert.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-billed</b> <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> is a {{gregarious species}} which feeds on grain and insects. This is a noisy bird, {{especially}} in colonies, {{with a range}} of cackles and squeaks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-billed</b> <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> {{is large}} and stocky, {{commonly}} measuring 23 to 24 centimeters. The adult is mainly black with white flecking {{on the back and}} wings. The conical bill is very thick, and appears more so because it is surmounted by a white frontal shield. The bill is white in breeding males.|$|E
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} of the white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> are now recognized.|$|R
50|$|The white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell in 1845.|$|R
50|$|Buffalo weaver: the <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> is {{the easiest}} among the little five to find and observe.|$|R
50|$|The {{body length}} of {{approximately}} 24 cm {{and the weight}} of 65 g place rank this as one of the largest of the Ploceidae (weaver birds). Visually the sexes are not greatly differentiated from one another. The red-billed buffalo weaver is differentiated from the <b>white-billed</b> <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> (Bubalornis albirostris) by the color of its bill.|$|E
50|$|Red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> {{breed in}} colonies. The nests are {{composed}} of an enormous mass of thorny twigs. These twigs are divided into separate lodges (compartments), each with multiple egg chambers. Each chamber has a smaller nest, typically built by the female (unless {{they are part of}} a cooperative breeding colony). The smaller nest is composed of grass, leaves, and roots. The whole nest is usually found in a thorny tree or in a windmill near areas inhabited by humans. It is interesting to note that when humans depart from particular areas, so do the red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> living in the same area. White-backed vultures and bateleurs tend to construct their nests above red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> nests, which is helpful in camouflaging their nests from predators.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Behavior {{and social}} organization== The red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> has been {{observed}} in small family groups or in large flocks.|$|R
50|$|Predators of the red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> include hawks, eagles, snakes, and baboons. They prey on both {{adult and}} {{adolescent}} birds.|$|R
50|$|These birds tend {{to live in}} dry savannahs and sparse woodlands. They prefer areas usually {{disturbed}} by humans and livestock. In fact, if people living in community {{with a population of}} red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> leave, the birds often depart as well. Thus as places continue to be urbanized, these birds find more homes. Additionally, overpopulation does not tend to be a problem for the red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> seeing as they live in colonies.|$|R
40|$|A mutualistic {{relationship}} between a flock of red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> Bubalornis niger and one individual of Long-tailed Fiscal Shrike Lanius cabanisi is described. The shrike benefited from the grasshoppers and other insects ftushed at ground level by the foraging <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers,</b> and followed them. The latter, in turn, {{took advantage of the}} antipredator behaviour and alarm calls of the shrike. In two cases when a predator approached, once the <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> ftew away for a time before re-associating again with the shrike, and the second time they simply « froze » temporarily when an hawk ftew over them. Both species followed each other for one and a half hours, but there was no « leader » or « follower » in this polyspecific association, the two species playing bath roles in tur...|$|R
50|$|The diet {{of the red}} billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> {{consists}} {{primarily of}} insects, seed and fruit. Particular insects the bird feeds on include crickets, locusts, grasshoppers, caterpillars, beetles, weevils, wasps, bees, ants, flies, and spiders. Its diet also includes scorpions. Most of these food sources {{are located in the}} soil or in low vegetation. As a result, the red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> does most of its foraging on the ground. Climate changes have not significantly affected the abundance of prey for the bird.|$|R
50|$|The white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> is 170 to(-) 190 mm {{in length}} and 57 to(-) 85 g in weight. In {{addition}} to its white head and underparts, the white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> has a vividly orange-red rump and undertail coverts. Its thighs are dark brown. Narrow white bands {{can be found on}} the wings. Both sexes are similar in plumage and hard to differentiate. The bill is conical and black. D. d. dinemelli has a brown tail, whereas D. d. boehmi has a black tail.|$|R
5000|$|In Kenya, pygmy falcons nest in white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> nests, and {{the ranges}} {{of the two}} birds coincide. [...] In {{southern}} Africa, they are found around red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> nests but predominantly nest in the vacant rooms of sociable weaver nests, which are large and multichambered—even if the sociable weavers still have an active colony in the nest. Despite being bird-eaters and bigger than sociable weavers, the pygmy falcons largely leave the latter alone, though they do occasionally catch and eat nestlings and even adults.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} the big five: lion, leopard, buffalo, African elephant and rhinoceros, {{as well as}} the small five: ant lion, leopard tortoise, <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver,</b> elephant shrew and rhino beetle.|$|R
50|$|The white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> is {{native to}} the African {{countries}} of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, Minnesota. It prefers habitats such as savanna, and shrublands, but especially dry brush and acacia thickets.|$|R
50|$|The lesser {{masked weaver}} (Ploceus intermedius) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Ploceidae. It builds its nests in large colonies, often {{alongside}} the village weaver and sometimes the red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver.</b> This species is commonly parasitised by the Diederik cuckoo.|$|R
50|$|The red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> (Bubalornis niger) is {{a species}} of bird in the Ploceidae family. It is found in Angola, Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Its natural habitat is the dry savanna.|$|R
50|$|The white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> or white-faced buffalo-weaver (Dinemellia dinemelli) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the family Ploceidae native to East Africa. The buffalo part of its name derives from its habit of following the African buffalo, feeding on disturbed insects. Two subspecies are recognized.|$|R
50|$|Only 3% of avian {{species have}} a phallus. The most common genital among birds is the cloaca; a direct tract for {{elimination}} and reproduction {{in both of}} the sexes 10. Certain bird species, such as the ratites, screamers, waterfowl, and cracids (a family of arboreal galliformes) exhibit a phallus in males. A notable example of a bird with a pseudo-penis is the red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver,</b> which do not use their pseudo-penis for direct insertion during copulation; however it does {{play a part in}} successful mating and stimulation. Similarly to the red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver,</b> the cassowary, a ratite, exhibits a pseudo-penis in both males and females. The male’s pseudo-phallus is used to “invaginate”, or to push the female’s pseudo-phallus inside-out, and then ejaculates from the cloaca to ensure a successful mating.|$|R
50|$|The red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} least concern (LC) on the IUCN status. While the global population of this species has not been estimated, this bird is considered common and the population is stable. There are currently no programs or organizations established to monitor and maintain the LC status of the bird.|$|R
2500|$|The Africa Savanna exhibit {{opened in}} April 1989 and is [...] in size. This exhibit {{includes}} animals typical of East Africa and includes an aviary and areas for large mammals. These include black rhinoceros, De Brazza's monkey, hippopotamus, bontebok, naked mole-rat, reticulated giraffe, masai giraffe, gerenuk, Speke's gazelle, southern ground hornbill, weaver birds, Cape thick-knee, red-crested turaco, hamerkop, <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver,</b> hingeback tortoises, and spiny-tailed lizards. The zoo kept a zebra named Citation {{until her death}} in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Male Red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> {{possess a}} pseudo-penis around 1.5 cm long. It was first {{reported}} in an 1831 German anatomist's {{report on the}} birds and subsequent {{research has shown that}} it is female selected. The pseudo-penis has no blood vessels and does not carry sperm but instead appears to be favored by the females for pleasure and aids males in attracting females; males in colonies have larger pseudo-penises than males which live alone, suggesting male-male competition has also favored the growth of this peculiar organ.|$|R
50|$|The {{magpie shrike}} is a gregarious species and usually occurs in noisy groups {{of about a}} dozen birds occupying a home range of several tens of hectares. It may {{associate}} with other birds such as the white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver</b> (Dinemellia dinemelli). The birds nest cooperatively during the rainy season, and their breeding territory is about three hectares and defended from other groups. Displays in the breeding season include bowing, tail flicking, wing raising and whistling. The female sometimes calls from the nest and the male brings her food. The two birds may also perform duets.|$|R
5000|$|Birds include African penguins, scarlet ibis, roseate spoonbills, white-fronted geese, snow geese, Canada geese, {{barnacle}} geese, trumpeter swans, black-bellied whistling ducks, white-faced whistling ducks, North American wood ducks, canvasbacks, ringed teal, North American ruddy ducks, Andean condors, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles, great horned owl, Swainson's hawk, Icelandic chickens, silver pheasants, peafowl, wild turkeys, Florida sandhill cranes, white cockatoo, yellow-naped amazon parrots, red-lored amazon parrots, blue-and-yellow macaws, sun parakeet, Jackson's hornbills, long-tailed finches, Bourke's parrot, red-crowned cranes, Taveta weavers, northern pintails, greater scaup, white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers,</b> Temminck's tragopan, Von der Decken's hornbills, crested partridge, rock doves, Ross's turacos, and Himalayan monals ...|$|R
50|$|The long-tailed fiscal {{feeds on}} insects, {{particularly}} beetles and grasshoppers, {{as well as}} small vertebrates such as lizards, snakes and bird chicks. It occurs as single birds or in small groups and hunts in the typical fashion for a shrike, perched about two metres off the ground where it watches for and then dives onto prey. Prey is usually taken {{from the ground and}} sometimes from foliage, but only rarely from the air. The species has been reported to have a mutualistic relationship with red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> in Tsavo in Kenya. The long-tailed fiscal benefits from associating with the weavers by snatching grasshoppers and other insects flushed by the foraging weavers, and the weavers benefited from the alarm calls made by the more vigilant fiscals.|$|R
50|$|Kenya has cheetahs (with an {{observation}} building), warthog, and a deck {{with a view}} of some springbok, lesser kudu, common eland, scimitar-horned oryx, and gray crowned cranes that roam across an African plain. saddle-billed storks and southern ground-hornbills make up the wetland-themed exhibits {{on the opposite side of}} the walkway. A bomas area, with huts to simulate a Kenyan village has lappet-faced vultures housed with white-necked ravens, Aldabra tortoises, bateleur eagles, red-flanked duikers, and blue duikers are worked into small exhibits. The walk-through Scrubland Aviary is home to several species of birds, including a white-cheeked turaco, white-faced whistling ducks, cattle egrets, a bare-faced go-away-bird, marbled ducks, lilac-breasted roller, taveta weavers, superb starlings, and a white-headed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weaver,</b> as well as side exhibits for red ruffed lemurs and silvery-cheeked hornbills.|$|R
50|$|The weaver species {{reported}} are: 12 {{species of}} weavers of Ploceidae family {{are found in}} Benin, out of the overall 111 of the genus Ploceus (true weavers) identified; they are larger than a sparrow, males are more colourful than female species. Other reported species are golden weaver, masked weaver (Ploceus velatus), common Vieillot's black weaver (Ploceus nigerrimus), black weavers (Ploceus melanogaster), grosbeak weaver (Amblyospiza albifrons), sparrow and <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers</b> dideric cuckoo (Chrysococcyx caprius), a handsome white cuckoo (Coracina pectoralis) which lays its eggs in weavers nests. More species of birds are: guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), black-and-white-chicken-like cuckoo found in North Benin, Abyssinian ground hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus), a large distinctive bird; the marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus); the crowned crane (Balearica pavonina), a tall grey-black bird; the saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), a large white bird with black wings. Birds also include puff adder and mamba.|$|R
5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins {{foraging}} at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, red-billed hornbills, red-billed <b>buffalo</b> <b>weavers,</b> and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{completion of}} the rainy season and nesting of granivorous birds between October and November in the Sudano-sahelian region of Senegal often results in very extensive bird damage to cereal crops. This occurs from both increased bird populations, due {{to the presence of}} juveniles as well as from their accompanying change in diet from insects to seeds. The damage is caused by several species of birds, most notable the Red-billed Dioch (Quelea quelea) and the Village and Black-headed Weavers (Ploceus cuculiatus and Ploceus capitalis). The <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Weaver</b> (Bubalornis albirostris) and the Glossy Starling Lamprotornis chalybaeus) also are at times serious crop depredators. Traditionally, farmers employ many different frightening techniques to chase or scare birds from their crops. The methods provide at best only temporary relief and require considerable time and energy. A possible solution to the bird problem involves the use of chemical repellents applied directly to the ripening grain. The purpose of the trial reported here was to evaluate methiocarb or Mesurol [4 -(methylthio) - 3, 5 xylyl N - methylcarbamate] as a bird repellent on ripening sorghum. The study was undertaken {{as a part of the}} Regional UNDP/FAO Project “Research into the Control of Grain-eating Birds,” aimed at the development and improvement of control techniques to prevent or reduce bird damage to cereal crops. The effectiveness of methiocarb as a nonlethal bird repellent has been demonstrated on several types of crops, among them cherries (Guarino, et al., 1974), blueberries (Bollengier, et al., 1973), sorghum (Mott and Lewis, 1975) and rice (DeHaven, et al., 1971). Trials by DeGrazio and DeHaven (1974) on wheat and rice in eastern Africa also have shown promise. Likewise, the Quelea Project has obtained some success with it against Passer Iuteus, Quelea quelea, and ploceus capitalis when applied to both ripening millet and rice (Bruggers, 1975, 1977) ...|$|R
