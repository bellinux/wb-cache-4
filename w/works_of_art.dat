60|$|What does it mean? What is a healthy, or an {{unhealthy}} <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art?</b> All terms that one applies to a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> provided that one applies them rationally, have reference to either its style or its subject, or to both together. From {{the point of}} view of style, a healthy <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> is one whose style recognises the beauty of the material it employs, be that material one of words or of bronze, of colour or of ivory, and uses that beauty as a factor in producing the aesthetic effect. From {{the point of view}} of subject, a healthy <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> is one the choice of whose subject is conditioned by the temperament of the artist, and comes directly out of it. In fine, a healthy <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> is one that has both perfection and personality. Of course, form and substance cannot be separated in a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art; they are always one. But for purposes of analysis, and setting the wholeness of aesthetic impression aside for a moment, we can intellectually so separate them. An unhealthy <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> on the other hand, is a work whose style is obvious, old- fashioned, and common, and whose subject is deliberately chosen, not because the artist has any pleasure in it, but because he thinks that the public will pay him for it. In fact, the popular novel that the public calls healthy is always a thoroughly unhealthy production; and what the public call {{an unhealthy}} novel is always a beautiful and healthy <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b>|$|R
