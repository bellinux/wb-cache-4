25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, {{who said that the}} raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E

It is impossible to maintain that the single centre whence the stories spread was not the India of fable, but the India of history, when we discover such abundance of story material in Egypt before, as far as is known, India \ had even become the India of fable.|$|E

These high German Officials had top spots in German Operations, Logistics, Transport, Military, Economy, and Communications. All 10 of the contacts survived through the various purges of Hitler.|$|R

6000|$|The {{scheme in}} fact {{involved}} a perpetual endowment of the [...] "black sheep," [...] calculated on the maximum of their ill-gained profits. [1] I confess that I found myself unable to assent {{to a plan}} which, {{in addition to the}} rewarding the evil doers, proposed to take away the privileges of a number of examining bodies which confessedly were doing their duty well, for the sake of getting rid of a few who had failed. It was too much like the Chinaman's device of burning down his house to obtain a poor dish of roast pig--uncertain whether in the end he might not find a mere mass of cinders. What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the great majority of the existing licensing bodies have marvellously improved {{in the course of the}} last twenty years, and are improving.

6000|$|I {{imagine that}} the words spoken can in no case have been {{identical}} with those which have come to us--which were, as we may say, prepared for the press by Tiro, his slave and secretary. We have evidence as to some of them, especially as to the second Catiline oration, that time did not admit of its being written and learned by heart after the occurrence of the circumstances to which it alludes. It needs must have been extemporary, with such mental preparation as one night may have sufficed to give him. How the words may have been taken down {{in such a case}} we do not quite know; but we are aware that short-hand writers were employed, though there can hardly have been a science of stenography perfected as is that with us.[150] The words which we read were probably much polished before they were published, but how far this was done we do not know. What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the words which he spoke moved, convinced, and charmed those who heard them, as do the words we read move, convince and charm us. Of these twelve consular speeches Cicero gives a special account to his friend. [...] "I will send you," [...] he says, [...] "the speechlings[151] which you require, as well as some others, seeing that those which I have written out at the request of a few young men please you also. It was an advantage to me here to follow the example of that fellow-citizen of yours in those orations which he called his Philippics. In these he brightened himself up, and discarded his 'nisi prius' way of speaking, so that he might achieve something more dignified, something more statesman-like. So I have done with these speeches of mine which may be called 'consulares,'" [...] as having been made not only in his consular year but also with something of consular dignity. [...] "Of these, one, on the new land laws proposed, was spoken in the Senate on the kalends of January. The second, on the same subject, to the people. The third was respecting Otho's law.[152] The fourth was in defence of Rabirius.[153] The fifth was in reference to the children of those who had lost their property and their rank under Sulla's proscription.[154] The sixth was an address to the people, and explained why I renounced my provincial government.[155] The seventh drove Catiline out of the city. The eighth was addressed to the people the day after Catiline fled. The ninth was again spoken to the people, on the day on which the Allobroges gave their evidence. Then, again, the tenth was addressed to the Senate on the fifth of December"--also respecting Catiline. [...] "There are also two short supplementary speeches on the Agrarian war. You shall have the whole body of them. As what I write and what I do are equally interesting to you, you will gather from the same documents all my doings and all my sayings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{coming from}} one of the most {{prominent}} ecclesiastical centres of ninth-century Francia the monk Abbo is unusually obscure for an individual responsible for a source such as the De bellis.

Though we <b>know</b> he <b>was</b> a Neustrian <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> his political agenda or affiliations, as he contradicts his own [...] "views" [...] throughout the work.

Certainly he did consider it authoritative, a true word from God. We cannot tell whether he ranked it alongside other prophetic books such as Isaiah and Jeremiah. What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> first, that other Jewish groups, most notably those living in Qumran near the Dead Sea, also used and valued 1 Enoch, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not find it grouped with the scriptural scrolls." ...|$|R

50|$|The most {{thorough}} {{piece of}} research on Bindon to date was written by the Knight of Glin in 1967.
