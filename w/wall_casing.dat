This research effort seeks {{to better understand}} non-periodic flow characteristics for a forward swept axial transonic compressor rotor when operating near stall. Improved performance of a military gas turbine engine may be achieved by better understanding the mechanisms responsible for near-stall non-periodic disturbances within a transonic compressor rotor. Using pressure transducers, embedded within the rotor <b>wall</b> <b>casing,</b> data were acquired and calibrated at various speeds up to 90 % of maximum rotation velocity. Within the 90 % design speed, various data sets were acquired for different throttle configurations. A new method to post-process the data to allow better investigating of the non-periodic flow characteristics was developed. Using Fast Fourier Transforms, two distinct and dominant frequencies were identified and analyzed. Contour pressure distribution maps for varying throttle configurations; and the amplitude differences for each frequency of interest was generated to illustrate correlations in frequency strength and its relationship with tip-leakage vortices, normal/oblique shocks, and passage-to-passage interactions. This study uses effective instrumentation and robust data reduction techniques to successfully identify passage-to-passage distribution of non-periodic and periodic low dominant frequencies within the rotor blade passage prior to stall.

40|$|The flow in {{the close}} {{vicinity}} of the blade-tip region of ducted propellers and similar hydro-machines can be quite complex due to the presence and dynamic interactions of the tip-leakage vortex (TLV), the blade trailing edge vortex, (TEV) the gap shear flow, the <b>wall</b> (<b>casing)</b> boundary layer, and the wake from the blade boundary layer. This tip region flow is important as {{it has the potential}} to contribute to a substantial loss in total efficiency and pumping head. In hydro-machinery, there is the additional issue of cavitation. In the present study, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were performed on the TLV from a ducted marine propulsor 33. 4 " in diameter at the blade TEV under steady operating conditions. The measurements were synchronized with the propeller angular position. Analysis of the velocity fields revealed considerable variations among the instantaneous realizations at a given spatial position in the tip vortex strength, its core size, and its overall structure. The implications of vortex variability on cavitation inception are discussed. In addition, significant differences exist between the averaged vortex properties from the instantaneous flow fields and the averaged vortex properties from the mean flow field. We will discuss these differences and their influence on cavitation performance and scaling...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of an assumed steady inlet {{circumferential}} total pressure distortion, three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations are conducted on an axial flow subsonic compressor rotor. The performances and flow fields of a compressor rotor, either casing treated or untreated, are investigated in detail either with or without inlet pressure distortion. Results show that the circumferential groove casing treatment can expand the operating range of the compressor rotor either with or without inlet pressure distortion {{at the expense of}} a drop in peak isentropic efficiency. The casing treatment is capable of weakening or even removing the tip leakage vortex effectively either with or without inlet distortion. In clean inlet circumstances, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex cause the untreated compressor rotor to stall. By contrast, with circumferential groove casing, the serious flow separation on the suction surface leads to aerodynamic stalling eventually. In the presence of inlet pressure distortion, the blade loading changes from passage to passage as the distorted inflow sector is traversed. Similar to the clean inlet circumstances, with a smooth <b>wall</b> <b>casing,</b> the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex are still the main factors which lead to the compressor rotor stalling eventually. When the rotor works under near stall conditions, the blockage resulting from the tip leakage vortex in all the passages is very serious. Especially in several passages, flow-spillage is observed. Compared to the clean inlet circumstances, circumferential groove casing treatment can also eliminate the low energy zone in the outer end wall region effectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} the end <b>wall</b> <b>casing</b> of a fan rotor is {{modified}} in an automated optimization process {{in order to}} achieve a higher efficiency and to gain surge margin. The casing end wall is allowed to take non-axisymmetric shapes by means of different parameters describing the contour. The control points defining the contour have only the possibility to move upwards or downwards in the radial direction. Given these non-axisymmetric shapes and that the simulations are conducted in the steady state, this study is a theoretical case not realizable in reality. The main aim is the understanding of the influence of end wall shaping on the flow and what the flow characteristics would be if the losses were minimized. The DLR in-house CFD code TRACE is used. The used optimization tool is AutoOpti, a DLR developed tool, which is based on a genetic algorithm speeded up by surrogate models. During the optimization two operating points are considered: One is calculated at a fixed backpressure (OP 1) representing the operating point at maximum stage efficiency for the smooth casing and the other one (OP 2) is an operating point near the surge limit calculated at a fixed outlet mass flow regulated by a PID controller. The optimization delivered some improvements that {{can be seen in the}} reduced losses in the tip area of the OP 1 as well as in the surge margin. It resulted as well in particular surface distortion patterns on the contour responsible for a change in the static pressure distribution in the tip area. The study mainly focuses on the aerodynamic explanation of these improvements analyzed in different members...|$|E
40|$|Machining of {{thin wall}} {{structures}} is a challenging area {{due to the}} problems such as chatter and forced vibrations that arise due to low stiffness of such structures. Up to now, {{most of the research}} was driven by need to improve productivity in manufacturing of aircraft components such as airframe panels; hence, straight thin walls such as cantilever structures were considered for research in machining dynamics. However, thin wall casings and particularly thin wall assemblies that are encountered in jet engine casings are not well studied. Not only their dynamics is quite different from that of straight thin walls, they present a different set of challenges for fixturing to minimise machining vibrations. Hence, there is a two-fold need of research: (i) to understand the effect of dynamics of thin wall casings on interaction of tool and workpiece and (ii) to design and validate damping solutions to minimise machining vibrations in such structures. In this work, both the above objectives are addressed. Initially a coupled dynamic interaction of tool and workpiece is studied through experimental analysis of machining vibration signal. This study was carried out both on a straight thin wall cantilever and on a thin <b>wall</b> <b>casing</b> to present the effect of variation of dynamics on dynamic coupling between tool and workpiece. The machining vibration signal was analysed in frequency and time-frequency domain to see which of the elements (tool or workpiece) are dominant during machining. For providing fixturing solutions to minimise machining vibrations, initially tuned mass dampers were studied. Tuned dampers with increased mass ratio were studied to see their effect in minimising vibrations. Subsequently, two novel surface damping solutions - viscoelastic based surface damper and torsion spring fixture - were proposed and validated experimentally. The design philosophy behind both these solutions is to improve mass and stiffness of the casing in addition to imparting damping. Finite element modelling was carried out to predict the dynamic response without and with proposed solutions...|$|E

Published literature has focussed on passive/active damping solutions for open geometry structure (e. g. cantilever thin wall), whereas more challenging situations such as closed geometry structures (e. g. thin <b>wall</b> ring-type <b>casings)</b> were not taken into consideration. In this study, a passive damping solution {{in the form of}} tuned viscoelastic dampers is studied to minimise the vibration of thin <b>wall</b> <b>casings</b> while focussing on the change in coupled interaction between tool and workpiece due to added tuned dampers.

A reduction in root mean square value, with tuned dampers, of about 2. 5 and 4 times is noted at higher and lower depths of cut, respectively, indicating a moderate dependency on depth of cut. A change in coupled interaction of workpiece with tool’s torsional mode (in undamped state) to that of tool’s bending mode (with tuned dampers) was also noted.

40|$|A recent {{research}} program has identified {{the possibility of}} using the analysis of <b>casing</b> <b>wall</b> pressures in the direct measurement of gas turbine rotor blade vibration amplitudes. Currently the dominant method of non-contact measurement of gas turbine blade vibrations employs the use of a number of proximity probes located around the engine periphery measuring the blade tip (arrival) time (BTT). Despite the increasing ability of this method there still exist some limitations, viz: the requirement {{of a large number of}} sensors for each engine stage, sensitivity to sensor location, difficulties in dealing with multiple excitation frequencies and sensors being located in the gas path. Analytical modelling of the <b>casing</b> <b>wall</b> pressures and reconstruction of rotor blade vibration amplitudes from the analysis of these simulated pressure signals has shown significant improvement over current non-contact rotor blade vibration measurement limitations by requiring only a limited number of sensors and providing robust rotor blade vibration amplitude estimates in the presence of simulated measurement noise.
