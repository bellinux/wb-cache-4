5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as {{it would have been easy}} to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not <b>well</b> <b>positioned</b> or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were <b>well</b> <b>positioned</b> across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{control is}} the {{potential}} <b>well</b> absolute <b>position.</b> For two kinds of potential shape (periodic and box), we propose approximated solutions to the stead-state motion planing problem: steering in finite time the particle from an initial <b>well</b> <b>position</b> to a final <b>well</b> <b>position,</b> the initial and final particle energies being identical. This problem is a quantum analogue of the water tank problem, where a tank filled with liquid is moved from one position where the surface is horizontal to another position where the surface is also horizontal.

40|$|Objectives: Telomere length (TL) is {{commonly}} measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Although easier than the southern blot of terminal restriction fragments (TRF) TL measurement method, one drawback of qPCR {{is that it}} introduces greater measurement error and thus reduces the statistical power of analyses. To address a potential source of measurement error, we consider the effect of <b>well</b> <b>position</b> on qPCR TL measurements. Methods: qPCR TL data from 3, 638 people run on a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ are reanalyzed here. To evaluate measurement validity, correspondence with TRF, age and between mother and offspring are examined. Results: First, we present evidence for systematic variation in qPCR TL measurements in relation to thermocycler <b>well</b> <b>position.</b> Controlling for these well-position effects consistently improves measurement validity and yields estimated improvements in statistical power equivalent to increasing sample sizes by 16 %. We additionally evaluated the linearity {{of the relationships between}} telomere and single copy gene control amplicons and between qPCR and TRF measures. We find that, unlike some previous reports, our data exhibit linear relationships. We introduce the standard error in percent, a superior method for quantifying measurement error compared to the commonly used coefficient of variation. Using this measure, we find that excluding samples with high measurement error does not improve measurement validity. Conclusions: Future studies using block-based thermocyclers should consider <b>well</b> <b>position</b> effects. Since additional information can be gleaned from <b>well</b> <b>position</b> corrections, re-running analyses of previous results with <b>well</b> <b>position</b> correction could serve as an independent test of the validity of these results.

5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way.

40|$|Increasing {{demands in}} world-wide energy {{consumption}} and oil depletion of large reservoirs {{have resulted in}} the need for exploring smaller and more complex oil reservoirs. Planning of the reservoir valorization usually starts with creating a model of the subsurface structures, including seismic faults and horizons. However, seismic interpretation and horizon tracing is a difficult and error-prone task, often resulting in hours of work needing to be manually repeated. In this paper, we propose a novel, interactive workflow for horizon interpretation based on <b>well</b> <b>positions,</b> which include additional geological and geophysical data captured by actual drillings. Instead of interpreting the volume slice-by-slice in 2 D, we propose 3 D seismic interpretation based on <b>well</b> <b>positions.</b> We introduce a combination of 2 D and 3 D minimal cost path and minimal cost surface tracing for extracting horizons with very little user input. By processing the volume based on <b>well</b> <b>positions</b> rather than slice-based, we are able to create a piecewise optimal horizon surface at interactive rates. We have integrated our system into a visual analysis platform which supports multiple linked views for fast verification, exploration and analysis of the extracted horizons. The system is currently being evaluated by our collaborating domain experts. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

25|$|In less {{developed}} countries, some traditional fishing villages persist {{in ways that}} have changed little from earlier times. In more developed countries, traditional fishing villages are changing due to socioeconomic factors like industrial fishing and urbanization.

The two red edge parameters were extracted with four approaches: four-point interpolation, polynomial fitting, Lagrangian technique, and inverted-Gaussian (IG) modeling. Experimental results indicate that the four-point approach is the most practical and suitable method for extracting the two red edge parameters from Hyperion data because only four bands and a simple interpolation computation are needed. The polynomial fitting approach is a direct method and has its practical value if hyperspectral data are available. However, it requires more computation time. The Lagrangian method is applicable only if the first derivative spectra are available; thus, it is not suitable to multispectral remote sensing. The IG approach needs further testing and refinement for Hyperion data. Index Terms—Hyperion, leaf area index, red edge <b>position,</b> red <b>well</b> <b>position.</b> I...|$|R
