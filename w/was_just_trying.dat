Realising she has escaped arrest for accidentally killing Sarah, Lydia lies to Charlotte, telling her how she and Sarah planned to travel and even adopt.

5|$|I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> {{to make a}} point. I {{wanted to}} show people {{how easy it is}} to {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled {{to tell her story}} because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

San Antonio <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they couldn't do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106–93.

It was unfortunate that Frank came out with his criticism, {{but he was the}} center of the storm, having designed the building, and he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to lessen the blame on himself." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process. Talking about {{the concept of the}} video, he stated [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to connect or {{articulate}} visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects." [...] The video doesn't last the entirety of the song, which director Nabil Elderkin stated was for artistic reasons. In an interview with Pitchfork, he reasoned [...] "to me, videos don't always have to be the length of the song. I like the idea of people thinking, 'What was that?'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Novacane" [...] {{was officially}} {{released}} {{as the first}} single from Nostalgia, Ultra on May 31, 2011. [...] "Novacane" [...] first charted on the US Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs on May 11, 2011 at number 65. The subsequent week, it rose to number 58, and on its third week, the single rose to number 52. In its fourth week, it rose to number 17. The music video for [...] "Novacane" [...] was released on June 16, directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin. When discussing the video, Ocean commented [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to connect or articulate visually {{the feeling of being}} [...] The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects."

500|$|Critics {{found some}} of Stargate's {{succeeding}} works {{a replica of}} Irreplaceables musical formula. Sheffield commented that, in the song [...] "Tattoo" [...] by Sparks, the team [...] "have no shame about churning out 'Irreplaceable' replicants forever", reprising the acoustic guitar-drum loop formula. The New York Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh deemed it [...] "sounds like a cousin" [...] of [...] "Irreplaceable". The release of R singer Chris Brown's 2007 single [...] "With You" [...] produced similar impressions: Sheffield, in his review for Brown's album, noted that [...] "Stargate <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time". Hillary Crosley of Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "With You" [...] "leans a bit too heavily" [...] toward [...] "Irreplaceable". Stylus Magazine also noted that Rihanna's Stargate produced single, [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] was a rehash of Ne-Yo and Stargate's previous works saying, [...] "Here you've got the 'Sexy Love' drums, the 'Irreplaceable' strum, {{and a bit of}} the synth and chorus melody from 'So Sick'... is hardly the new twist all these old bits need to sound fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|The July and August 2001 cover art of Is This It is by Colin Lane and {{features}} {{a photograph of}} a woman's nude bottom and hip, with a leather-gloved hand suggestively resting on it. The model was later revealed to be Lane's then-girlfriend, who explained that the photoshoot was spontaneous and happened after she came out of the shower naked. Lane recalled that a stylist had left the glove in his apartment and noted, [...] "We did about 10 shots. There was no real inspiration, I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to take a sexy picture." [...] The result was included in the book The Greatest Album Covers of All Time, in which Grant Scott, one of the editors, noted influences from the daring works of Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin in its design. Scott concluded, [...] "It's either a stylish or graphically strong cover or a sexist Smell the Glove travesty." [...] Although British retail chains HMV and Woolworths objected to the photograph's controversial nature, they stocked the album without amendment.|$|E
500|$|During the {{immediate}} post-UDI period Beadle, {{in his role}} as Chief Justice, occupied a unique position as he could speak directly with all the main players—Gibbs, Smith and Wilson. He became the main intermediary between them, and received a dormant commission from the UK government to replace Gibbs as Governor in case of necessity. He visited London in January 1966 and, according to Wilson's Attorney General Elwyn Jones, was [...] "scornful of the 1965 constitution". Some in Rhodesia criticised Beadle for going to London, or accused him of siding with Gibbs against Smith. The Chief Justice insisted that he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to do his best for Rhodesia, a claim Smith accepted, saying Beadle [...] "thought more of his country than of his position". The UK Foreign Office remained wary, speculating in a January 1966 report that while the British government hoped to reclaim Rhodesia [...] "in such a way that policy and thinking is reoriented, racial attitudes changed, and the path to majority rule firmly laid," [...] the Chief Justice [...] "would be content to see a 1961-type constitution, without independence, remain for a long time".|$|E
