This is accepted in the Jain tradition as <b>what</b> <b>started</b> the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E

In November 1942, the Custodian of Enemy Property, which already controlled most Japanese-Canadian property, began hinting towards obtaining the right to sell property, not just administer it. This idea was well received by the Department of Labour who was unsure how to pay of Japanese-Canadian internment; selling their property would help Japanese Canadians pay for their own detention.|$|E
25|$|Voicemail is the {{managing}} of telephone messages from a centralized data storing system. Voicemail is stored on hard disk drives, media generally used by computers {{in order to}} store other forms of data. Messages are recorded in digitized natural human voice similar to how music is stored on a compact disc. To retrieve and to play back messages, a user calls the system from any phone, {{and his or her}} messages can be retrieved immediately. The first voicemail system, known as the Speech Filing System (SFS), was invented by Stephen J. Boies in 1973. <b>What</b> <b>started</b> as a research project at the IBM Thomas J.

Dr. Sytner suggested that the band should play at the golf club first, so as to assess their talent. After performing at the golf club Sytner phoned Walley a week later and offered the band an interlude spot playing skiffle between the performances of two jazz bands at The Cavern, on Wednesday, 7 August 1957.|$|E
25|$|From the 1940s until 1972—and {{again in}} the early 1990s—the Jordan Marsh {{flagship}} store in Boston's Downtown Crossing was home to the Enchanted Village, a lavish Christmas display which at its height took over an entire floor of the department store and was also spotlighted in its display windows. The centerpiece of the display, besides Santa, was an eight-set Lionel electric train display. From <b>what</b> <b>started</b> as a marketing gimmick, the Enchanted Village quickly became a legendary Boston tradition and an annual mainstay of the city's holiday season. Macy's discontinued the Enchanted Village in 1998 when it was moved to City Hall Plaza. More recently it has been housed in the Hynes Convention Center.|$|E

The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. <b>What</b> <b>started</b> out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

25|$|Fifth-century Athens is the Greek {{city-state}} of Athens in {{the time}} from 480 BC-404 BC. This {{was a period of}} Athenian political hegemony, economic growth and cultural flourishing formerly known as the Golden Age of Athens with the later part The Age of Pericles. The period began in 478 BC after defeat of the Persian invasion, when an Athenian-led coalition of city-states, known as the Delian League, confronted the Persians to keep the liberated Asian Greek cities free. After peace was made with Persia in the mid 5th century BCE, <b>what</b> <b>started</b> as an alliance of independent city-states became an Athenian empire when Athens abandoned the pretense of parity among its allies and relocated the Delian League treasury from Delos to Athens, where it funded the building of the Athenian Acropolis and put half its population on the public payroll and maintained dominating naval power in the Greek world. With the empire's funds, military dominance and its political fortunes guided by statesman and orator Pericles, Athens produced some of the most influential and enduring cultural artifacts of the Western tradition. The playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides all lived and worked in 5th century BCE Athens, as did the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates. Athens' patron goddess was Athena, from whom they derived the name.|$|E

Jane Boursaw of TV Squad liked the revelation about Walter's safe deposit boxes, but questioned Olivia's logic to get out of her SUV when fleeing her kidnappers. SFScope's Sarah Stegall exclaimed, [...] "Now this is science fiction! I was absolutely thrilled by this week's episode". She elaborated by praising Olivia's [...] "B story" [...] about her and John Scott's memories, the series' use of [...] "cold-blooded" [...] villains, and believed [...] "the elements of the show are finally achieving some balance." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted [...] "Wow.

Attendance at the Birthday Party is free. Weather-permitting, it occurs on the last Saturday in April in Pease District Park; a rain date is scheduled for the following weekend. Bright and diverse costumes are common. In keeping with the original traditions of the event, a live donkey and a may pole are always present. The event begins in the late morning and continues until dusk. Food and drinks are sold onsite by local Austin 501c-3 non-profit groups. [...] Purified water is available onsite for participants to fill their own containers. [...] Due to the lack of parking in the area and the high attendance, the Friends of the Forest Foundation provides festive shuttle buses between state parking lots just north of the capitol building and Pease Park. [...] Singing of folk and road trip songs is encouraged on the short bus ride.|$|E
500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was given}} a {{positive}} reception by many critics of the show.

Futterman wrote that it [...] "gave us the charm, wit and just-zany-enough-to-be-plausible plot lines we were sorely missing after last week's predictable" [...] episode, and added, [...] "Even better: the episode didn't feel as long as the 90 minutes it clocked in at." [...] IGN Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10. While he said the episode was entertaining, he felt that it {{did not need to be}} an hour and a half. Emily Yahr of The Washington Post agreed about the extended length, and did not like what she called [...] "lame attempts to fill time", which she said [...] "detracted from <b>what</b> <b>started</b> as a decent episode". She did, however, cite several [...] "promising storylines", including Rachel's, and noted, [...] "Usually, New Directions leader Rachel Berry is a caricature of all things annoying—but this episode, we see her genuinely struggling with wanting to love herself the way she is". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson summed it up as follows: [...] "Not an epic episode, just sort of … meh." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times reacted more positively and wrote, [...] "The 90-minute episode had a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, some good lessons, character development, a few good numbers and more than a few surprises." ...|$|E
