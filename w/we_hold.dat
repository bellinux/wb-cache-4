25|$|Hume's {{argument}} {{is supported by}} modern day compatibilists such as R. E. Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F. Strawson argued {{that the issue of}} whether <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.|$|E
25|$|Authentic human {{happiness}} for Plotinus {{consists of}} the true human identifying with that {{which is the best}} in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that eudaimonia (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.|$|E
500|$|We {{conclude}} that, in {{the field}} of public education, the doctrine of [...] "separate but equal" [...] has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.

500|$|July 3–6, 1986, was {{designated}} [...] "Liberty Weekend", marking {{the centennial of}} the statue and its reopening. President Reagan presided over the rededication, with French President François Mitterrand in attendance. July 4 saw a reprise of Operation Sail, and the statue was reopened to the public on July 5. In Reagan's dedication speech, he stated, [...] "We are the keepers of the flame of liberty; <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> it high {{for the world to}} see." ...|$|E
500|$|For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & {{everything}} we possess or make use of?

If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves? ...|$|E
500|$|Castro {{was adamant}} that the {{missiles}} remain but Mikoyan, seeking {{to avoid a}} full-fledged confrontation with the United States, attempted to convince him otherwise. He told Castro, [...] "You know that not only in these letters but today also, <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> to the position that you will keep all the weapons and all the military specialists {{with the exception of}} the 'offensive' weapons and associated service personnel, which were promised to be withdrawn in Khrushchev's letter [...]" [...] Castro balked at the idea of further concessions, namely the removal of the Il-28 bombers and tactical nuclear weapons still left in Cuba. But after several tense and grueling weeks of negotiations, he finally relented and the missiles and the bombers were removed in December of that year.|$|E

500|$|By 14 March, the {{expedition}} crews {{had completed the}} change over, but until the shuttle undocked, Shepherd officially remained commander of the station. The morning of the 14th the astronauts' wake-up call was the song [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go" [...] by The Clash, {{at the request of}} Shepherd's wife. Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL, said during the change over ceremony: [...] "May the good will, spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure. Sail her well." [...] The commander of Discovery, Jim Wetherbee, said [...] ""For Captain Shepherd and his crew, <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> you in admiration as we prepare to bring you home. This has been an arduous duty for you. This ship was not built in a safe harbor. It was built on the high seas." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} was received {{with a positive}} response from critics. Jordan Zivitz of Montreal Gazette called the performance [...] "insanely theatrical, Broadway-worthy." [...] Melissa Maerz wrote for Entertainment Weekly that [...] "As visually spectacular as it was narratively [...] heavy-handed, {{it felt like a}} callback to her last tour, 'MDNA', which featured a dark charade that found Madonna wielding a gun on stage. But when the song ended with video footage of the gladiators knocking over a saintly-looking Madonna statue, the tone changed. Madonna has built a career by playing with what <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> sacred, whether it's crucifixes or underground dance crazes. Now the only sacred thing she's tearing down is Madonna herself." [...] The performance of the song at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

"Taken together," [...] Reinhardt concluded, [...] "the {{regulations}} and the preamble may be reasonably read to provide notice that vessels that engage in at-sea transfers of fins, {{are prohibited from}} landing shark fins in a U.S. port, {{but they do not}} provide notice that such vessels are prohibited from possessing fins for the purpose of making a delivery to a foreign port." [...] He also noted that the preamble had language stating it was not the NMFS's intent to interfere with international trade. [...] "Under the circumstances, a reasonable person would not have fair notice that the activities of the KD II would render it a fishing vessel under [...] As a result, <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> that the district court's application of the possession prohibition of the SFPA to the KD II as a fishing vessel ... violated due process." ...|$|E

500|$|Colbert is {{the central}} {{character}} in the 2007 book I Am America (And So Can You!). Co-written with Paul Dinello and the writers of The Colbert Report, I Am America delves into what the character considers {{to be the most}} pressing issues facing America. The book takes influence from the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as O'Reilly's The O'Reilly Factor (2000) and Hannity's [...] (2004), which Colbert says he [...] "forced" [...] himself to read as a reference. I Am America is considered a pure extension of the Report; the written medium allowed the writers to employ different styles, such as long-format arguments, that they could not have used on television. [...] "You can actually spend 20 pages talking about religion whereas in the show, two pages is about as long as <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> any one idea", Colbert explains. In doing this, the writers [...] "discovered things that [...] cared about that... they didn't know he cared about before".|$|E
500|$|A Channel Seven {{spokeswoman}} {{revealed that}} the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Ferguson {{confirmed}} that Pogba would feature with the senior team during the season, stating, [...] "I mean if <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> Pogba back, what's going to happen? He's going to leave. You know, in a couple of years' time when his contract is going to finish. So we have to give him the opportunity to see how he can do in the first-team and he's got great ability." [...] Pogba was promoted to the club's reserve team permanently for the 2011–12 season and made his first appearance of the season on 15 August 2011 in the team's opening Premier Reserve League match against Arsenal. On 25 August, in the team's second league match against Swansea City reserves, Pogba scored the second goal in a 6–0 rout. On 19 September, he was named to the first team to participate in their Football League Cup tie against Leeds United the following day, with Ferguson proclaiming, [...] "I intend to play him [...] against Leeds United." [...] Pogba appeared as a half-time substitute to make his professional debut as Manchester United won the match 3–0. Pogba made his second appearance against Aldershot Town in the Fourth Round of the League Cup on 25 October 2011.|$|E
