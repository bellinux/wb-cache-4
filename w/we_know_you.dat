[...] On the morning of September 4, 20 Weatherwomen entered the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) office and held the office workers captive until the Weatherwomen had run off copies of a leaflet to be handed out to student sympathizers. One of the Weatherwomen told Miss Dodd, who worked in the AFSC office, [...] "We thought until now you were on our side. Now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are a member of the enemy." [...] A short time later, all 75 Weatherwomen appeared at South Hills High School in Pittsburgh to participate in a [...] "jailbreak". The women spray painted anti-war slogans, [...] "Ho lives" [...] and [...] "Free Huey", on the school's main entrance doors, and handed out leaflets, urging high school students to [...] "bring the war home," [...] and asking students to leave the school campus. [...] Some Weatherwomen made speeches in the school's playground about racism, imperialism, and the SDS national action plans. Oughton was able to escape from the Pittsburgh police, but 26 others, including Cathy Wilkerson and Jane Spielman, were arrested at the school. The students at the high school had no idea who the Weatherwomen were, or even why the women chose their school.|$|E
