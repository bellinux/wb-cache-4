5|$|Arran {{also has}} three rare endemic species of tree, the Arran Whitebeams. These are the Scottish or Arran <b>whitebeam,</b> the cut-leaved <b>whitebeam</b> and the Catacol <b>whitebeam,</b> which are amongst the most {{endangered}} tree {{species in the}} world. They are found in a protected national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 283 Arran <b>whitebeam</b> and 236 cut-leaved <b>whitebeam</b> were recorded as mature trees in 1980. The Catacol <b>whitebeam</b> was discovered in 2007 and steps {{have been taken to}} protect the two known specimens.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} three endemic species of tree, the Arran whitebeams. These trees are the Scottish or Arran <b>whitebeam</b> (Sorbus arranensis), the bastard {{mountain}} ash or cut-leaved <b>whitebeam</b> (Sorbus pseudofennica) and the Catacol <b>whitebeam</b> (Sorbus pseudomeinichii). If rarity {{is measured by}} numbers alone they are amongst the most endangered tree species in the world. They are protected in Glen Diomhan off Glen Catacol, {{at the north end}} of the island by a partly fenced off national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 236 Sorbus pseudofennica and 283 Sorbus arranensis were recorded as mature trees in 1980. They are typically trees of the mountain slopes, close to the tree line. However, they will grow at lower altitudes, and are being preserved within Brodick Country Park.|$|E
5|$|The flora include chalk grassland-loving {{species such}} as {{marjoram}} and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. It was once common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors. It {{is also home to}} unique species of <b>whitebeam.</b>|$|E
50|$|It has {{sometimes}} been placed in a separate genus of its own as Micromeles alnifolia, differing from other <b>whitebeams</b> in the deciduous sepals on the fruit (persistent in other <b>whitebeams),</b> but genetic evidence places it close to Sorbus aria.|$|R

5|$|The hill is {{blanketed}} in heather, {{which gives}} it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, {{as well as some}} unique <b>whitebeam</b> species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), <b>whitebeam</b> (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
5|$|The south part of {{the woods}} {{is an area of}} former pasture {{woodland}} with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol <b>whitebeam</b> (Sorbus bristoliensis) and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, {{making it one of the}} most important sites in Britain for this tree. Birds which live in the woods include the raven (Corvus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Many butterflies and moths can be seen in summer including the white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album).|$|E
50|$|In Scandinavia, {{particularly}} Norway, similar {{species have}} evolved following similar evolutionary pressures, but quite {{independently of the}} Arran <b>whitebeams.</b>|$|R
5|$|Only thirty-one {{species of}} {{deciduous}} tree and shrub are native to Scotland, including 10 willows, four <b>whitebeams</b> and three birch and cherry species.|$|R
50|$|Slopes {{within the}} {{woodland}} {{are covered with}} small-leaved lime trees; oak and hazel are more common on flatter hilltop areas. Rare <b>whitebeams</b> are also dotted throughout the wood.|$|R
5|$|The {{offshore}} islets of Eilean na Cloich and Eilean Dubh in the Lynn of Lorn and Bernera and Dubh Sgeir in the Lynn of Morvern to {{the west}} and Eilean Gainimh to the NE, are extensively used by common seals and form the Eileanan agus Sgeirean Lios mòr Special Area of Conservation. The whole island of Bernera is also a SSSI, its limestone maritime cliffs being a key feature along with the presence of the nationally scarce rock <b>whitebeam.</b> Creag Island and Pladda are other islets in the Lynn of Lorn. Eilean nan Caorach, Inn Island, Eilean Droineach and Eilean Ramsay are amongst another cluster of small islands off the north coast, and Eilean Loch Oscair is to the NW. Lismore Lighthouse, built by Robert Stevenson, lies on the small island of Eilean Musdile to the south west, with Lady's Rock a kilometre further away in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|Killarney <b>whitebeam</b> (Sorbus anglica) is a shrub {{or small}} tree that grows on rocks close to lakeshores. It is {{found only in}} Killarney. The more common Irish <b>whitebeam</b> (Sorbus hibernica) {{is also found in}} the park.|$|E
500|$|The Arran Whitebeams are species {{unique to}} the Isle of Arran. The Arran <b>Whitebeam</b> (Sorbus arranensis) and the Cut-leaved <b>Whitebeam</b> (S. pseudofennica) are amongst the most {{endangered}} tree species in the world if rarity is measured by numbers alone. Only 236 S. pseudofennica and 283 S. arranensis were recorded as mature trees in 1980. The trees developed in a highly complex fashion involving the Rock <b>Whitebeam</b> (S. rupicola), which is found on nearby Holy Isle but not Arran, [...] interbreeding with the Rowan (S. aucuparia) [...] to produce the new species. In 2007 {{it was announced that}} two specimens of a third new hybrid, the Catacol <b>Whitebeam</b> (S. pseudomeinichii) had been discovered by researchers on Arran. This tree is a cross between the native Rowan and S. pseudofennica.|$|E
50|$|The berries are a {{favourite}} of birds, {{though less}} palatable (drier, less juicy) than rowan berries. <b>Whitebeams</b> are sometimes used as larval food plants by Lepidoptera species including Short-cloaked Moth.|$|R
50|$|Pinnatifid: Pinnately {{dissected}} to {{the central}} vein, but with the leaflets not entirely separate; e.g., Polypodium, some Sorbus (<b>whitebeams).</b> In pinnately veined leaves the central vein in known as the midrib.|$|R
50|$|Karol Szymanowski alley, {{crossing}} {{the southern part}} of Ossoliński avenue is unique by the presence of a monumental perspective of 46 specimens of Swedish <b>whitebeams,</b> all listed as Polish monuments of nature.|$|R
500|$|The gorge {{is also an}} {{important}} site for whitebeams and in 2009 a survey was carried out by botanists from the Welsh National Herbarium as part of a nationwide survey of whitebeams. Among the eight species identified were three new species previously unknown to science. Nineteen specimens with oval-shaped leaves, were named the [...] "Cheddar whitebeam", Sorbus cheddarensis, [...] fifteen specimens with roundish leaves and greyish brown bark were named the [...] "Twin Cliffs whitebeam", Sorbus eminentoides, and thirteen with long, narrow leaves were named [...] "Gough’s Rock whitebeam", Sorbus rupicoloides. The Cheddar <b>whitebeam,</b> which has evolved as a cross between the common <b>whitebeam</b> and the grey-leaved <b>whitebeam,</b> is unique to the gorge, but its survival is threatened by the goats that were introduced specifically to keep down the growth of new trees and encourage the proliferation of rare plant species such as the Cheddar pink. Cuttings have been taken from the trees to be grafted and grown on at the Welsh National Herbarium.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania, again {{commissioned}} by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to {{his brothers and sisters}} in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish <b>whitebeam</b> trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus' observations were published the next year in [...]|$|E
500|$|Dunkery Beacon is {{the summit}} of Dunkery Hill, and the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset. The {{sandstone}} hill rises to [...] and provides views over the surrounding moorland, the Bristol Channel and hills up to [...] away. The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age with several burial mounds {{in the form of}} cairns and bowl barrows. Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. At the top of Selworthy Beacon is a National Trust plaque and a view of the south coast of Wales across the Bristol Channel. The South West Coast Path also climbs the hill and ends slightly shy of the summit. Its elevation is [...] Behind the hill, there are precipitous cliffs. Near the summit are a series of cairns, thought to be the remains of round barrows, and the Iron Age Bury Castle. The round cairns have been scheduled as an ancient monument. In the 16th century, Selworthy Beacon was [...] the site of a beacon to warn of impending invasions. The mausoleum of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland is about [...] from Selworthy Beacon. The hills have a deep purple colour during the summer due to the covering of heather. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow here or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique <b>whitebeam</b> species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found here and in nearby Horner Woods. Horner Woods are also the home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species, which include barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.|$|E
50|$|Numerous hybrids, mostly {{behaving}} as true species reproducing by apomixis, {{occur between}} rowans and whitebeams; these are variably intermediate between their parents but generally more resemble <b>whitebeams</b> {{and are usually}} grouped with them (q.v.).|$|R
50|$|The {{steep slopes}} and {{historic}} quarrying of limestone for agriculture and construction, {{such as the}} Avonmouth Docks, {{have resulted in a}} diverse woodland. Trees include pedunculate oak, ash, field maple, yew, small-leaved lime, wild service-tree, wayfaring tree and rare <b>whitebeams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Britain is {{relatively}} impoverished {{in terms of}} native species. For example, only thirty-one species of deciduous tree and shrub are native to Scotland, including ten willows, four <b>whitebeams</b> and three birch and cherry. This {{is a list of}} tree species that existed in Britain before 1900. The sheer number of tree species planted subsequently precludes a complete list.|$|R

50|$|It is a {{deciduous}} shrub {{growing to}} 2-3 m tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, oval-elliptic, 3-7 cm long, with an acute apex and a serrated margin; they are green on both sides, without the white felting found on most <b>whitebeams.</b> The flowers are pink, with five forward-pointing petals 5-7 mm long; they are produced in corymbs 3-4 cm diameter. The fruit is an oval red pome 10-13 mm diameter.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is acting}} {{as a part of}} the {{conservation}} effort to ensure the survival of three species of the rare indigenous and endemic trees commonly called the Arran <b>whitebeams,</b> native to that island and found nowhere else in the World. Chapelholms Wood has been designated as a Wildlife Site by the Scottish Wildlife Trust in recognition of the quality of its habitats and the species diversity it exhibits.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{preserved}} specimen is {{from the}} bastard mountain ash, S. pseudofennica, collected in 1797 from North Arran and another {{of the same species}} is in the British Museum dated 1838, when it was known as Pyrus pinnatifida (the pear group). S. pseudofennica was authoritatively recognised as a separate species by Clapham, Tutin and Warburg in 1952. Landsborough in 1875 noted the two kinds growing in Glen Diomhan and called then French rowan or <b>whitebeams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Arran {{also has}} three rare endemic species of tree, the Arran Whitebeams. These are the Scottish or Arran <b>whitebeam,</b> the cut-leaved <b>whitebeam</b> and the Catacol <b>whitebeam,</b> which are amongst the most {{endangered}} tree {{species in the}} world. They are found in a protected national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage.

50|$|Sorbus alnifolia (syn. Aria alnifolia), {{also called}} alder-leafed <b>whitebeam,</b> Korean <b>whitebeam,</b> or Korean {{mountain}} ash, , is {{a species of}} <b>whitebeam</b> native to eastern Asia in eastern and northern China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan.|$|E
50|$|Sorbus mougeotii (Vosges <b>whitebeam</b> or Mougeot's <b>whitebeam)</b> is {{a species}} of <b>whitebeam</b> native to the {{mountains}} of central and western Europe from the Pyrenees east through the Alps to Austria, and north to the Vosges Mountains.|$|E
40|$|An {{account of}} the <b>Whitebeams</b> (Sorbus L., Rosaceae) of Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, England is given. Sorbus aria is abundant, and variable. Sorbus anglica and S. eminens are quite widespread, but S. porrigentiformis is rarer. Three new {{polyploid}} species endemic to the gorge are described supported by DNA analysis: S. cheddarensis, S. eminentoides and S. rupicoloides. The gorge {{is one of the}} most important sites for Sorbus in Britain. Browsing is affecting significant numbers of Sorbus trees, and grazing is affecting regeneration...|$|R
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{important}} trees species and specimens; a Grand Fir in Argyll is the tallest tree in the United Kingdom and the Fortingall Yew may be the oldest tree in Europe. The Arran <b>Whitebeams,</b> Shetland Mouse-ear and Scottish Primrose are endemic flowering plants and there {{are a variety}} of endemic mosses and lichens. Conservation of the natural environment is well developed and various organisations play an important role in the stewardship of the country's flora. Numerous references to the country's flora appear in folklore, song and poetry.|$|R
50|$|The site's {{principal}} {{interest and}} the reason for its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the <b>whitebeams</b> Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field Garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum).|$|R
