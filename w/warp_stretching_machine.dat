50|$|An {{anamorphic}} stretch transform (AST) {{also referred to}} as <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> transform is a physics-inspired signal transform that emerged from time stretch dispersive Fourier transform. The transform can be applied to analog temporal signals such as communication signals, or to digital spatial data such as images. The transform reshapes the data {{in such a way that}} its output has properties conducive for data compression and analytics. The reshaping consists of <b>warped</b> <b>stretching</b> in Fourier domain. The name “Anamorphic” is used because of the metaphoric analogy between the <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> operation and <b>warping</b> of images in anamorphosis and surrealist artworks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hydraulic {{stretch forming}} {{is a very}} {{important}} technology. Punch press has achieved multi-station automatic processing in the press area, which has greatly improved the efficiency. However, the main domestic <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> is single-stretching hydraulic machine at present. Compared with punch press, hydraulic <b>stretching</b> <b>machines</b> take less space and have better security, but they make less efficiency and have lower degree of automation. Hence, in order to take the advantage of hydraulic <b>stretching</b> <b>machines</b> and enhance the automation level, studies on multi-position automatic <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> occupies an important position. This paper proposes a design scheme of Six-station Automatic Hydraulic <b>Stretching</b> <b>Machine</b> (SAHSM) according to the practical production. The overall 3 D structure of SAHSM is designed based on Solidworks to prove the theoretical possibility of the program. Then modal analysis is operated based on FEA of the key components of <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> module to improve reliability of the product and overcome the disadvantage of the traditional checking method, the first two-order modes are obtained to prove the impossibility of the resonance. At last, ADAMS-based virtual prototype is analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the SAHSM dynamic design proposed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|Anamorphic (<b>warped)</b> <b>stretch</b> {{transform}} is a physics-based mathematical {{operation that}} reduces the signal bandwidth without proportionally increasing {{the size of the}} signal, thus providing space-bandwidth product compression. Its digital implementation emulates the physical effect by a non-uniform allocation of pixel density. This compression mechanism {{can be used as a}} pre-processing operation than may enhance conventional image compression techniques.|$|R

The FE model of flexible multi-gripper stretch forming was established, and extensive numerical simulations of spherical parts for two kinds of flexible <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machines</b> were carried out. The variations of stress, strain, thickness and springback value of spherical parts for two kinds of drawing modes were analyzed. The numerical {{results show that the}} quality of spherical parts formed by the back and down drawing type of <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine</b> is better than that by the back drawing type of <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine.</b> This work provides a machine for developing the technology of stretch forming...|$|R

In this alternative data compression method, information-rich portions of the data are dilated {{in a process that}} emulates the effect of group velocity dispersion on temporal signals.

50|$|In time {{stretched}} imaging, the object’s {{spatial information}} is encoded in {{the spectrum of}} laser pulses within a pulse duration of sub-nanoseconds. Each pulse representing one frame of the camera is then stretched in time {{so that it can}} be digitized in real-time by an electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ultra-fast pulse illumination freezes the motion of high-speed cells or particles in flow to achieve blur-free imaging. Detection sensitivity is challenged by the low number of photons collected during the ultra-short shutter time (optical pulse width) and the drop in the peak optical power resulting from the time stretch. These issues are solved in time stretch imaging by implementing a low noise-figure Raman amplifier within the dispersive device that performs time <b>stretching.</b> Moreover, <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> transform can be used in time stretch imaging to achieve optical image compression and nonuniform spatial resolution over the field-of-view.|$|R

Data about elasticity, load, and other factors is compiled and a report is produced. The report is then analyzed {{to determine whether or not}} the entire rail is safe to use.|$|R
40|$|High {{throughput}} real-time {{instruments are}} needed to acquire large data sets for detection and classification of rare events. Enabled by the photonic time stretch digitizer, {{a new class of}} instruments with record throughputs have led to the discovery of optical rogue waves [1], detection of rare cancer cells [2], and the highest analog-to-digital conversion performance ever achieved [3]. Featuring continuous operation at 100 million frames per second and shutter speed of less than a nanosecond, the time stretch camera is ideally suited for screening of blood and other biological samples. It has enabled detection of breast cancer cells in blood with record, one-in-a-million, sensitivity [2]. Owing to their high real-time throughput, instruments produce a torrent of data - equivalent to several 4 K movies per second - that overwhelm data acquisition, storage, and processing operations. This predicament calls for technologies that compress images in optical domain and in real-time. An example of this, based on <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> transformation and non-uniform Fourier domain sampling will be reported...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of {{discrete}} clamp <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine</b> based on flexible holding technology was developed to improve the performance of traditional rigid clamp <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine</b> used for double-curvature metal sheet forming, and its forming characters were illuminated simply. The FE model of flexible discrete clamp stretch forming was set up, and extensive numerical simulations of spherical parts for both the flexible holding mode and the rigid holding mode were carried out by dynamic explicit finite element analysis. The numerical {{results show that the}} distribution of stress, strain and thickness were well-proportioned in the flexible holding mode. The larger the spherical radius is, the smaller the minimum transitional length of sheet metal is. The transitional length of 60 mm is suitable for flexible discrete clamp stretch forming in the case of considering the forming quality and material utilization. Then, the stretch forming experiment proves that the flexible holding technology is feasible, and the error contrast illustrates the {{new type of}} discrete clamp <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine</b> is practicable...|$|R

30|$|Dyeing {{of fabric}} blends such as Cotton/Nylon (C/N) is {{presently}} dyed by two-bath or one-bath two-step dyeing. Good solidity of hue and depth is more critical in 50 : 50 blends and in union fabrics, such as nylon <b>warp</b> <b>stretch</b> fabrics, containing cotton or nylon/cotton wefts for swim wear and narrow fabrics, crimped nylon warp/viscose filament dress wear, or cotton warp/nylon weft constructions for uniforms, rain wear or work wear. Cotton/nylon {{is also used}} in socks. Nylon being a polyamide contains many amide groups in its structure. It also contains free amine groups {{at the ends of}} its polymeric chains, although the number of these free amine groups is less than the number of carboxylic groups, and the fiber possesses a negative charge unless in the appropriate pH region (Haji et al. 2014). These amine groups provide excellent electrostatic and hydrogen bonding sites and are the main factors contributing to the substantively of the dye molecules. Acid dyes have very little affinity for cotton, but cationic cotton can be dyed readily with acid dyes. The ammonium groups act as dye sites (Run-ling 2010).|$|R

40|$|Biaxially {{oriented}} polypropylene {{films are}} widely used for food packaging and industrial films. Recently, machine speed has been increasing {{in order to obtain}} higher production rate, and film thickness has become thinner to reduce the environmental load. The customers' requirements for better production ability and thinner films have been becoming more demanding, but their demands are not always met because of lack of film stretchability in the final product. To meet the demands, research on stretchability has been conducted with the goal of finding the optimum polypropylene molecular structure for developing a new product by analyzing stretching force-strain data using a table tenter, which was thought to be the parameter of stretchability. It was found that low crystallinity and wide molecular weight distribution were effective in improving the stretchability from the table tenter test. By running the test with a sequential and biaxially oriented <b>stretching</b> <b>machine,</b> it was verified that samples produced by the above designed polymer indicated good thickness uniformity, which was considered to be the barometer of stretchability. Furthermore, it was concluded that analyzing the stretching force-strain data obtained from a table tenter is a good method to predict machine speed and film thickness. © 2012 Society of Plastics Engineers...|$|R
