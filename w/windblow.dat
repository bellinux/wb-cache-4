50|$|<b>Windblow,</b> North Carolina, is an unincorporated {{crossroads}} {{community on}} the border of Montgomery and Richmond Counties, North Carolina. Located at the intersection of North Carolina Highway 73 and NC State Road 1003, <b>Windblow</b> is an agricultural community. <b>Windblow</b> is noted for its peach production; it is the namesake for the <b>Windblow</b> variety of peach. This particular peach, and many others, was developed at the Sandhills Research Station, a facility operated by North Carolina State University, one mile north of the crossroads. The community has a small grocery store and a trucking business in addition to the area farms.|$|E
50|$|It prefers rich, well-drained {{sandy loam}} with a pH of 6-7, but will grow in any loose, moist soil. Seedlings will {{tolerate}} shade, but saplings and older trees demand full sunlight for good growth; in forests it typically regenerates in gaps created by <b>windblow.</b> Growth is rapid, particularly with root sprouts, which can reach 1.2 m (4 feet) {{in the first}} year and 4.5 m (15 feet)in 4 years. Root sprouts often result in dense thickets, and a single tree, if allowed to spread unrestrained, will soon be surrounded by a sizable clonal colony, as its stoloniferous roots extend in every direction and send up multitudes of shoots.|$|E
50|$|Past the freeway, NC 73 heads northeastward {{through a}} small portion of Montgomery County and the {{community}} of <b>Windblow</b> on its way into Moore County. Here, it serves Jackson Springs as it progresses toward the town of West End, built up around the junction of NC 73 and NC 211. The two highways overlap for one block through the center of town before splitting and continuing on their separate ways. NC 73 leaves West End and heads generally eastward to Eastwood, a community south of the county seat of Carthage and north of the village of Pinehurst, where it ends at an intersection with US 15-501.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>windblow</b> in Sitka spruce plantations throughout the UK has {{raised concerns about}} the differences in wood quality of blown trees compared to standing crops. This {{has led to an}} investigation of the influence of <b>windblow</b> on batten performance and associated properties. This study has examined timber from 3 sites containing windblown trees of Sitka spruce, which were blown over at different times in the past and were still alive. The three time intervals between the damaging storms and the study were 6 months, 18 months and 36 months. The three sites were located in North England, Mid Scotland, and North Scotland and a total of 45 trees were sampled from three different ages of <b>windblow.</b> After the field characterisation of the trees and surrounding crop, logs and discs were removed from the sample trees and analysed for batten performance using a stress-grading machine. Batten performance is a direct measure of timber quality in terms of strength, whereas concentrating on density of battens is only an indicator. Discs were cut from the end of each log before they entered the sawmill. The data collected from these discs will allo...|$|E
40|$|Damage {{caused by}} wind poses a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} economic management of forests. In recent times, large storm {{events such as the}} 1999 Lothar storm and January 2005 gales have caused significant economic damage to areas of forest across Europe. However, wind damage also occurs at a smaller scale that may be harder to detect. Traditionally, vertical or oblique aerial photography has been the main method used to assess extent of new wind damage. Smaller areas of localised damage may not even be detected until the area is ready for harvest. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate a variety of remote sensing systems as sources from which <b>windblow</b> can be both i) interpreted manually by operators, and ii) semi-automatically delineated by segmentation techniques. In theory wind damage (or <b>windblow)</b> results in areas of trees that have different, textural or spectral characteristics than their neighbours and should therefore be identifiable. In practice however, the spectral and spatial resolutions of the sensors as well as the knowledge and skill of the individual interpreting the image will all impact upon the practical use of each data source. A series of 8 images from a variety of remote sensing systems were acquired and co-registered over a 2 km x 7 km focus area just south of Kielder Water in Kielder Forest District for which ground truth was available. The images were acquired between 13 th March 2002 and 14 th May 2003 and cover at eight different spatial resolutions from 0. 25 m (Aerial Photography) to 30 m (Landsat) in size. The experiment was designed to test the ability of interpreters with different levels of experience to detect <b>windblow</b> using each sensor. The selected interpreters included professional foresters (all with varying levels of experience in forest management, aerial photography and image interpretation) and a control group of non-foresters (with little experience of forestry or image interpretation). Subjects were asked to mark each of 24 potential <b>windblow</b> sites within the focus area on a four-point scale from 0 (definitely no <b>windblow)</b> to 3 (definite <b>windblow)</b> for each of the 8 images. The results show the influence of spatial resolution and spectral information on image interpretation. High spatial resolution appears very important for identifying internal wind damage while spectral information is more important within the 0. 25 - 5 m spatial resolution range. The results also illustrate the importance of training in image interpretation and of local knowledge. Finally the results of the manual interpretation were then compared with a second semi-automated method of highlighting wind damage by applying image segmentation algorithms to a high resolution LiDAR scan of the study area...|$|E
30|$|Although the {{programme}} had {{its origins}} in the stochastic analysis of radiata pine plantations, it is widely applicable to other species of even-aged plantations and forests. For tropical plantations, for example, the disasters might be framed {{in terms of the}} frequency of occurrence of cyclones, rather than fires. In less fire-prone temperate regions, <b>windblow</b> or snow or hail damage may be the relevant natural disaster. The programme is capable of analysing any even-aged forest for which appropriate models are available to predict future log volumes by grades and their prices.|$|E
40|$|The DR 21 {{massive star}} forming region {{contains}} two cometary H II regions, aligned nearly perpendicular {{to each other}} on the sky. This offers a unique opportunity to discriminate among models of cometary H II regions. We present hydrogen recombination and ammonia line observations of DR 21 made with the Very Large Array. The velocity of the molecular gas, measured from NH 3 emission and absorption lines, is constant to within ± 1 km s − 1 across the region. However, the radial velocity of the ionized material, measured from hydrogen recombination lines, differs by ≈ 9 km s − 1 between the “heads ” of the two cometary H II regions and by up to ≈ 7 km s − 1 from that of the molecular gas. These findings indicate a supersonic velocity difference between the compact heads of the cometary regions and between each head and the ambient molecular material. This suggests that the observed cometary morphologies are created largely by the motion of <b>windblowing,</b> ionizing stars through the molecular cloud, as in a bow shock model.

30|$|For all {{investigated}} HM (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn), {{the correlations}} between concentrations in moss and the modelled total atmospheric deposition (EMEP, LOTOS-EUROS) were land class specific and element specific. Significant positive correlations were found for about 30 % (As), 78 – 81 % (Cd), 15 % (Cr), 63 % (Cu), 44 % (Hg), 15 % (Ni), 78 – 89 % (Pb), 19 % (V), and 44 % (Zn) of 27 ELCE units being represented by moss sample sizes n[*]>[*] 10. This {{is in line with}} similar findings for Cd, Hg and Pb based on data from 2005 [9, 10] and was supplemented for further seven elements. This study confirms that mosses are good biomonitors for atmospheric deposition of Cd and Pb [38] and to some extent also for Cu, but this study suggests that mosses are less good as biomonitors for other HM like Cr, Hg, Ni, V, and Zn. The amount of ELCE-specific correlation coefficients is closely connected to uncertainties in deposition modelling contributing to variation and potential influencing factors in the use of mosses as monitors of atmospheric deposition [38, 39]. Particular mention is to be made of different emission data used for EMEP and LE [40] probably explaining the differences in the correlations (Table  2) and, respectively, the direction and/or intensity of the discriminant lines (Cd and Pb in Fig.  4). Besides this, modelled data are grid-specific (LE: 25  km[*]×[*] 25  km; EMEP: 50  km[*]×[*] 50  km) and moss data are site specific, meaning that we are always working at spatial limits of extrapolation in the moss monitoring network. Density of land use around the sampling sites should not only considered as a relevant factor for element concentrations in moss [12, 13], but even more as an indicator for influencing factors such as areal and point emission sources that are very evident in some Balkan countries effected mainly from <b>windblowing</b> dust and mineral particles [41 – 43]. Further important factors than those considered in the modelling of background atmospheric deposition influencing the amount of correlation are particularly mineral particles, mainly windblown dust from local soil (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, V) and root uptake in higher plants from soil and transfer to mosses by leaching from dead or living plant material [44]. Low correlations with As implies that As metabolism could be more involved than expected [45]. Also precipitation pH may play a role because it affects the solubility of heavy metals and hence their uptake by mosses which should be taken into account in further investigations. Due to the existing uncertainties in the deposition modelling, future studies should also include comparisons between heavy metal concentrations in moss tissue and atmospheric deposition measured by technical samplers, e.g. within the EMEP framework [22]. Also, other potential pollutants, such as nitrogen or persistent organic pollutants (POP), should be included. First pilot studies on POP exist, for example, in Germany [5].|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} to aid to examine and {{consider}} the initiation conditions, dynamic properties and depositional characters of a dry fragment flow which {{is a kind of}} grain flow, and the relationship of the dry fragment flow to a talus slope, by means of the flield observation at Ashio, Japan and the laboratory experiment using a model talus. First of all, field observations show that the occurrence of dry fragment flows is resulted from the grain flow originated already in a chute cut on a free face behind {{in the case of a}} successive connection of an an apex of the talus slope and the end of the chute, and is caused by impact due to rockfall and removal of the surficial fine materials consisting the talus materials due to <b>windblow</b> which was observed especially in a dryer winter season. Field observations also make clear that the smooth surface of the fines on the upper part of talus slope, formed by dry fragment flows, provides a possibility for the following occurrences of the movement of coarser rock fragments superposed on it. On the other hand, the laboratory experiment suggests that the talus slope of the fines has an initiation of dry fragment flows on a shorter slope or a shoter slope segment and the coarser talus do it on a longer one. This fact makes a possibility for an explanation of the frequent occurrences of the flows on a long talus of the fines as grus. The above results appear also to explain frequent initiations of the dry fragment flows on the upper part of the slope, especially at the talus slope with grain size grading. Since the dry fragment flow posses a downward percolation of the fine materials in its motion to result in reverse grading structure, this mechanism is thought to cause the flow to allow to continue its movement over a long distance on the coarser surface than the grain size of the flow layer itself. It is stressed furthermore that differentiation of the lower fine materials and the upper coarser ones in the dry fragment flow deposit is unreasonable because a set of them indicate a flow unit of the dry fragment flow. Contributions of the dry fragment flow to the talus slope may depend upon the grain size and its distribution of rock fragments supplied from a free face; if the talus slope has contineous supply of fine materials such as gruse, the slope segments beyond the critical slope length mentioned above would develop due to dry fragment flows. If the talus slope, on the other hand, takes a wide range of grain size of rock fragments, the talus slope may develop by rockfall process to show grain size grading. Under such a slope condition the dry fragment flows would play a significant role to transfer the fine materials down toward the lower slope portion where is covered by coarser materials deposited by rolling andor jumping of rock debris fallen onto the talus slope...|$|E
