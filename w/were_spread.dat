5|$|His pale, heavy-boned face {{showed signs}} of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging over {{the sides of the}} seat; his legs <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> wide over the pale, rose-colored velvet carpet.

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February24, a house caught fire and the flames <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> to other {{buildings}} by the wind. In two hours, most of Holmden Street, and parts of Brown and Second Streets, were reduced to smoldering ashes. The worst of multiple fires occurred on August 2, burning down several city blocks and destroying 27wells.|$|E

5|$|Not {{unlike the}} circuit riders in the Episcopal and Methodist traditions, the presbyteries often sent out licentiates to {{minister}} in multiple congregations that <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> {{out over a}} wide area. To meet the need for educated clergy, Princeton Theological Seminary and Union Presbyterian Seminary were founded in 1812, followed by Auburn Theological Seminary in 1821.|$|E
5|$|Students {{and alumni}} {{flocked to the}} Polo Fields, working around the clock, to rebuild the Bonfire {{in time for the}} game. It was {{completed}} only hours before it was scheduled to burn. After the 1994 Bonfire was burned, two tons of lime <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> on the Polo Fields to stabilize the ground. This layer hardened to a consistency similar to concrete.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{became the}} subject of rumours and myths, {{including}} a widespread belief that he was a cannibal. Some of the rumours, such as the mutilation of one of his wives, <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> and popularised by the 1980 film Rise and Fall of Idi Amin and alluded to in the film The Last King of Scotland in 2006, a movie which earned actor Forest Whitaker an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Amin.|$|E

5|$|As Roman troops <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> {{increasingly}} thin {{over its}} long border, the Empire's territory continued to dwindle in {{size as the}} population of the empire declined. Barbarian war bands increasingly began to penetrate the Empire's vulnerable borders, both as settlers and invaders. In 451, the Romans defeated Attila the Hun, but only with assistance from a confederation of foederatii troops, which included Visigoths, Franks and Alans. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces swiftly finding themselves cut off deep in the enemy's rear.|$|E
5|$|At the Beijing games, 15 {{athletes were}} awarded medals for their {{performance}} in events. Three of those athletes (Kerron Stewart, Shericka Williams, and Usain Bolt) were awarded multiple medals. Usain Bolt won the most medals of any Jamaican at Beijing after achieving three gold medals. Of the 50 athletes, which <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> across four sports (swimming, track and field, cycling, and equestrianism) and 29 distinct events, Natasha Moodie {{was the youngest}} member of the delegation (17 years old), while Samantha Albert was the oldest member of the team (37 years old). Gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown was the nation's flag bearer at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E

5|$|Basset's lands did {{not form}} a compact estate, as they <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> over 11 counties. In 1135, Basset's lands totalled 184.25 carucates of land, and were later {{considered}} 15 knight's fees. In Leicestershire, Basset held {{most of the}} lands held by Robert de Buci {{at the time of}} the Domesday Survey of 1086. The lands were held by Basset of the king by right of his wife, but how the lands had passed into her family is unclear. In addition, Basset held land in Leicestershire from both King David I of Scotland and from Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|By early 1862, {{a single}} general, Albert Sidney Johnston, {{commanded}} all the Confederate forces from Arkansas to the Cumberland Gap, but his forces <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> too thinly {{over a wide}} defensive line. Johnston's left flank was Polk, in Columbus with 12,000 men; his right flank was Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 4,000 men; the center consisted of two forts, Forts Henry and Donelson, {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, also with 4,000 men. Forts Henry and Donelson were the sole positions defending the important Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively. If these rivers were opened to Union military traffic, two direct invasion paths would lead into Tennessee and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E

5|$|Lumber {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons. The PhiladelphiaErie Pike (present day Pennsylvania Route 504) opened the Black Moshannon area to settlers by 1821. The first settlers opened the Antes Tavern along the Pike, trapped fur-bearing animals, and cleared land for farming.|$|E

5|$|Preservation of {{the outer}} {{parts of the body}} was {{normally}} achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings.

Finally, the deceased was wrapped in animal skins and laid to rest. The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins.|$|E

5|$|The Operations Research Section (ORS) {{was also}} set up {{in light of the}} success of such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. Many scientists were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to Air Marshal Bowhill. Four sections were set up; planned flying and maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and a certain degree of ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|The church survived {{until the}} 11th century, {{when it was}} abandoned. Thereafter it was liberally plundered for sculptures and other {{architectural}} elements (spolia) by both the Byzantines and, after the sack {{of the city in}} 1204, by the Crusaders. Several pieces from St. Polyeuctus were reused in the Monastery of Christ Pantokrator (the modern Zeyrek Mosque), and various pieces such as capitals <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> to places as far as Venice, Barcelona and Vienna, including the so-called Pilastri Acritani ("Pillars of Acre") in St Mark's Basilica, Venice.|$|E
5|$|The {{consortium}} took {{possession of}} the mill in November 1979. The first priority {{was to make the}} mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E
