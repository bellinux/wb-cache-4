5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of Han merchants: those <b>who</b> <b>sold</b> goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale itinerant traders who traveled between cities and to foreign countries. The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes. Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who {{had to resort to}} peddling were to be exempted from taxation.|$|E

5|$|A sale of 1,000 coins {{was made}} to an {{executive}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they {{were placed in the}} Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound {{up in the hands of}} a coin dealer, <b>who</b> <b>sold</b> them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} that, in early May 1944, an {{uncontrolled}} agent based in Spain (<b>who</b> <b>sold</b> fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on {{details of a}} meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts {{it does not appear}} that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint. The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs <b>who</b> <b>sold</b> their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E

This Edmund Clerke was the Sheriff of Hampshire and clerk to the Signet in 1671. Clerke the younger married the daughter of Giles Frampton, who took control of the manor after Clerke's death and sold it to Edmund Dummer, a former Surveyor of the Navy, in 1705.|$|E
5|$|George Trice {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, <b>who</b> <b>sold</b> Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced {{for the first time}} to the three routes then operated. The company made an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E

His eventual descendant William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1652-1671) died aged 19 without progeny when his title passed by law to his heir male but his unentailed estates including Netley and Hound, passed top his sister Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury (1656-1741), <b>who</b> <b>sold</b> Netley in 1676 to Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester (1629-1700), later Duke of Beaufort.|$|E
