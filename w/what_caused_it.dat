5|$|Suzuki was {{inspired}} to write a biography of a tree when he noticed a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic {{with the help of}} a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the Maclean's and the National Post non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 it was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language, others found it too technical.|$|E
500|$|The Legendary Axe has {{not been}} {{released}} for the Wii's Virtual Console service, and IGN's Lucas Thomas rated the game as the 3rd best in a list of [...] "Top10 unreleased TurboGrafx Titles" [...] for the system. He {{said that he was}} shocked to find that this game was not on the Virtual Console, given {{that it was one of}} the TurboGrafx-16's flagship titles that were heavily advertised when it was released. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer, in a look back to video gaming in January1989, made a similar comparison of the game to Rastan, [...] "with a lot of sword slashing and platform jumping". The reviewer said that the popularity of The Legendary Axe in Japan was <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> to be released as a TurboGrafx-16 launch title in North America.|$|E
500|$|Beebe {{remained}} {{active well}} into his old age. In 1957, {{at the age of}} eighty, he was still capable of climbing slippery tree trunks in order to study bird nests. However, by 1959 his strength had lessened enough that long hikes and tree climbing were no longer practical for him, and he contented himself with work that could be conducted in the laboratory, such as dissecting birds' nests to analyze their method of construction. Beebe also began to be afflicted with a throat ailment which may have been Sjögren's syndrome, although lacking a complete understanding of <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>it,</b> Beebe and his doctors referred to it as [...] "mango mouth". Beebe was reluctant to accept speaking engagements because of the effect this had on his voice, although he continued to give lectures on occasion with Jocelyn's help.|$|E

[...] The soldiers made a long line and fired into out tepees among our women and children. [...] That was the first we knew of any trouble.

2500|$|In the 1970s, {{one of the}} Shiden fighters was {{recovered}} from Bungo Channel in shallow water some [...] from shore. Among the fishermen who helped bring the aircraft to the surface were ones who had witnessed it falling into the water on 24 July 1945. The wrecked aircraft showed no bullet holes and provided no other clue as to <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> to ditch. It was restored for display and placed in an exhibit at a nearby museum in Shikoku. No evidence is available to identify which 343rd Air Group pilot flew the fighter, so the museum honors all six of the Shiden pilots {{who lost their lives}} that day, including Muto and Oshibuchi.|$|E
2500|$|The Vigili del Fuoco di Genova ("Genovese Fire Service") ashore fired a {{breeches}} buoy from the mole to the midships accommodation block. This was made fast on the ship, and the firemen hauled three Indian crewmen to safety. Captain Muir persuaded his wife Dorothy to go next, but the buoy jammed and flung Mrs Muir from the harness {{to her death}} on the rocks below. Some sources suggest that {{the breaking of the}} ship into two coincided with the fire service's attempt to winch Mrs Muir to safety, that this caused the {{breeches buoy}}'s [...] nylon rope to flex and this was <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> first to jam and then to fling Mrs Muir onto the rocks. A fireman, Giuliano Macchi, tried several times to reach her but without success. Captain Muir leapt after his wife into the sea. He was later seen in the water with one leg seriously injured, and then was not seen again.|$|E

2500|$|In India, Stilwell {{soon became}} {{well-known}} for his no-nonsense demeanor and disregard for military pomp and ceremony. His trademarks were a battered Army campaign hat, GI shoes, and a plain service uniform with no insignia of rank; he frequently carried a Model 1903, [...]30-06 Caliber, Springfield rifle in preference to a sidearm. His hazardous march out of Burma and his bluntly honest {{assessment of the}} disaster {{captured the imagination of}} the American public: [...] "I claim we got a hell of a beating. We got run out of Burma and it is humiliating as hell. I think we ought to find out <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>it,</b> go back and retake it.". Stilwell's derogatory remarks castigating the ineffectiveness of what he termed Limey forces, a viewpoint often repeated by Stilwell's staff, did not sit well with British and Commonwealth commanders. It was well known among the troops that Stilwell's disdain for the British was aimed toward those high command officers that he saw as overly stuffy and pompous.|$|E
2500|$|He however was applauded when {{he spoke}} about the Palestinian peoples' right to self-determination.

[...] He also stated [...] "the most liberated women in the world are the women in Iran". Despite having previously called the Holocaust a [...] "myth", Ahmadinejad stated [...] "granted this happened, what does this have to do with the Palestinian people?" [...] He used Koranic quotes to criticize the Bush administration and the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. [...] He also described Iran's nuclear ambitions as peaceful measures aimed at increasing Iran's energy production.
