So the fundamental field equations are Weyl equations including gauge vectors. We deduced these Weyl equations without gauge vector from quadric surface in three dimensional oriented projective geometry. It showed that Weyl equations were equations of <b>generating</b> <b>lines</b> in the quadric surface. In other word, the geometric correspondence of spinor is <b>generating</b> <b>lines</b> of quadric surface in momentum space. It also showed that two spinors would generate a gauge vector.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for reconstructing {{the shape of}} a cylindrical object from contour and shading without knowing the surface albedo of the object or the lighting conditions of the scene. The input image is segmented into spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces by analyzing local shading. The cylindrical surface is characterized by the direction of the <b>generating</b> <b>lines,</b> determined from spatial derivatives in the image. The brightest <b>generating</b> <b>line</b> has strong constraints on the shading analysis on the cylindrical surface and leads to a simplification of the equation which represents the relation between the contour shape and the shading. Although there remains one degree of freedom between the surface normal of the base plane and the slant angle of the <b>generating</b> <b>line,</b> we can uniquely recover the cylindrical shape from this solution (up to reflection). Experimental results for synthetic image are shown. 1...|$|R

As a consequence, the cone defined by a complete linear system over M or over a closed G-stable subvariety of M is normal.

A power ray tracing model {{is used for}} calculating and optimizing refractive profile parameters and obtaining optical-power characteristics (OPCs) of Fresnel lenses.

Analysis of characteristics of circular Fresnel lenses with conical (the facet <b>generating</b> <b>lines</b> are straight ones) and curvilinear (the facet <b>generating</b> <b>lines</b> are curved ones) refracting surfaces has been carried out.
