5|$|According to De ponderibus et mensuris, {{a famous}} 13th century text {{that exists in}} {{numerous}} variations and is often ascribed to Dino di Garbo, the system of weights used in Salerno <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> systems used in Padua and Bologna. As {{can be seen from}} the table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9drachms, rather than 8drachms.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E
5|$|Gaiman {{described}} {{writing the}} series as odd, {{since he had}} not written comics in half a decade; the story was trimmed down significantly as the size went from six 36-page chapters to eight 22-page segments. He also {{wanted to write a}} comic that <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Sandman, his most recognized work. The profits of the series went to help fund his Marvels and Miracles LLC company, which is fighting for the rights to Marvelman.|$|E

50|$|Black {{proposed}} a theory {{where there is}} a zero-beta return which <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risk-free return. This fits the data better since <b>the</b> zero-beta return <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risk-free return. It still presumes, on principle, that there is higher return for higher beta.|$|R

She starred {{in the title role}} in a touring company {{production}} in 1951, succeeding Jean Arthur. The play was not a musical, and <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> subsequent version starring Mary Martin a few years later, but had five songs by Leonard Bernstein. Captain Hook was played by Boris Karloff. Her performance in Peter Pan was praised by critics, and it was her favorite acting role.|$|E
5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{encourages}} {{everyone to}} fulfill the Islamic requirement of dawah even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other Islamic movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote dawah as a mechanism of self-reform.|$|E
5|$|Through the 2015–16 season, each {{individual}} award, {{with the exception}} of the Finals MVP, was awarded at the end of the regular season while the NBA Playoffs were ongoing. This procedure <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other major professional sports leagues, which have long handed out individual awards after their postseasons have concluded. The 2016–17 season was the first in which the NBA held an awards show after the completion of the Finals, during which the winners of all season-long individual awards are announced except for the winner of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, which continues to be announced during the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|A {{weekly radio}} drama of Shakugan no Shana aired four episodes between November 29 and December 20, 2003 on Dengeki Taishō. The {{scenario}} was an original side-story written by Yashichiro Takahashi, and takes {{place between the}} first and second light novel volumes. The cast for the radio drama <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> anime adaptations. A CD compilation of the radio drama titled Shakugan no Shana Drama Disc, including an additional audio drama, was eligible for mail orders up to March 31, 2004. Another drama CD was released with the April 2008 issue of Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine; the cast is the same as with the anime versions.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> en-route frequency {{being used by}} the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was {{a departure from the}} usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} a {{concentric}} fortress, which von Haschenperg had hoped would combine the best of Italian military architecture, able to carry heavy guns but with a low profile to protect against any incoming artillery fire. Various flaws rapidly became apparent. The castle's design had focused on defence, {{with the result that}} the guns could not easily be brought to bear on enemy vessels, which had been the original intent of building the fortification by the Camber; some of the angles of fire from the defences were blocked by the entrance and the high water table may have caused serious damp problems on the ground floor. Furthermore, the design <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other Device Forts constructed across the region and would have stood out as unusual and not in keeping with the King's general intent for the chain of forts.|$|E
5|$|There were a {{total of}} twelvetropical storms during the season, fiveof which were unnamed. Of all the storms, fourwere hurricanes. Compared to the average {{activity}} from the previous two decades, the season's activity was below normal despite average sea surface temperatures and a normal number of tropical waves. Instead, the inactivity {{was the result of}} the subtropical ridge being located further south than normal, which decreased the atmospheric instability across much of the basin. Such a pattern <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> more active 1954 and 1955 seasons. Several tropical depressions formed that did not attain tropical storm status, many of which formed beneath an unfavorable upper-level trough.|$|E
5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's {{right to}} erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied {{to erect a}} cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until {{a few weeks after}} Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice Department.|$|E
