5|$|Inmates {{are allowed}} to receive their families, partners, or friends privately twice a week for two hours. Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, towels, and condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room <b>with</b> <b>toys</b> and baby-changing facilities is available. Inmates are checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay with them for 24 hours. The house has a small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room with a dining table, a sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area <b>with</b> <b>toys.</b> Foreigners are not allowed and inmates have to complete a child-development education program to have 24-hour-long visits. During visits, staff make regular checks on the prisoners and their families.|$|E

5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played <b>with</b> <b>toys</b> such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the close}} {{similarity}} between play and hunting, cats prefer {{to play with}} objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before. Cats also tend to play <b>with</b> <b>toys</b> more when they are hungry. String is often used as a toy, {{but if it is}} eaten, it can become caught {{at the base of the}} cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.|$|E

5|$|With his {{positive}} attitude and quirkiness, Pee-wee became an instant cult figure, earning {{a star on}} the Hollywood Walk of Fame by 1989, and successfully building a Pee-wee franchise, <b>with</b> <b>toys,</b> clothes and other items generating more than $25 million at its peak in 1988. Reubens also published a book as Pee-wee in 1989 called Travels with Pee-Wee. CBS aired reruns of Playhouse until July 1991, when Reubens was arrested, pulling from their schedule the last two remaining reruns. Fox Family Channel briefly aired reruns of the Playhouse in 1998. In early July 2006, Cartoon Network began running a teaser promo during its Adult Swim lineup. A later press release and many other promos confirmed that the show's 45 original episodes would nightly air from Monday to Thursday starting on that date. Playhouse attracted 1.5 million viewers nightly. In 2007, TV Guide named Playhouse {{one of the top}} 10 TV cult classics of all time. Several children's television personas cite Pee-wee Herman as an inspiration, including Blue's Clues's Steve Burns and SpongeBob SquarePants's Stephen Hillenburg.|$|E

25|$|Toys {{for infants}} often {{make use of}} {{distinctive}} sounds, bright colors, and unique s. Through play <b>with</b> <b>toys</b> infants begin to recognize shapes and colors. Repetition reinforces memory. Play-Doh, Silly Putty and other hands-on materials allow the child to make toys of their own.|$|E
25|$|The act of children's play <b>with</b> <b>toys</b> {{embodies the}} values {{set forth by}} the adults of their {{specific}} community, but {{through the lens of}} the child's perspective.

25|$|<b>With</b> <b>toys</b> {{comprising}} such a {{large and}} important part of human existence, {{it makes sense that}} the toy industry would have a substantial economic impact.

25|$|As with Roverandom, Tolkien's initial {{inspiration}} {{came from}} an incident with his children playing <b>with</b> <b>toys.</b> Tolkien invented Tom Bombadil in memory of a Dutch doll which had been flushed down a lavatory. These original poems far pre-date the writing of The Lord of the Rings, into which Tolkien introduced Tom Bombadil from the earliest drafts.|$|E
25|$|Playing <b>with</b> <b>toys</b> is {{considered}} to be important when it comes to growing up and learning about the world around us. Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help their bodies grow strong, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, and practice skills they will need as adults. Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth.|$|E
25|$|Brian McCarty (1974) is a {{contemporary}} artist and photographer {{known for his}} work <b>with</b> <b>toys.</b> McCarty's approach is based upon integrating toy characters into real-life situations {{through the use of}} forced perspective in carefully crafted scenes. Preferring to work in-camera and without compositing, McCarty creates his photographs by sometimes traveling to exotic locations, including active war zones. Although grounded in reality, because of his use of wit and whimsy, McCarty's work is often associated with the Art-Toy, Lowbrow, and Pop Surrealist movements.|$|E

Each November thousands of churches, groups and individual donors prepare and collect shoeboxes filled <b>with</b> <b>toys,</b> school supplies, personal items, and other small gifts. A booklet of bible stories is often distributed alongside the shoebox gifts which are given to children based on need alone, regardless of their faith. These boxes are then distributed overseas by volunteers. , over 124 million boxes have been delivered.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not unusual}} for some animals to play <b>with</b> <b>toys.</b> An example of this is a dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young {{chimpanzees}} use sticks as dolls – the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees. They carry their chosen stick and put it in their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.|$|E
25|$|Each year, for the {{remaining}} two decades of her life, Bianco produced numerous books and short stories. Most of them continued her preoccupation <b>with</b> <b>toys</b> coming to life {{and the ability of}} inanimate objects and animals to express human emotions and feelings. There was always melancholy, but in the end the reader emerged spiritually uplifted. 1926's The Apple Tree and The Adventures of Andy, 1927's The Skin Horse, also illustrated by Pamela, 1929's The Candlestick, 1930's Other People's Houses and 1931's The House that Grew Smaller are among some of her works from that period.|$|E
