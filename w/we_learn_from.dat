5|$|Such {{publications}} {{were followed}} by multilingual collections, of which the most ambitious was Alessandro Torri’s L'elegia di Tommaso Gray sopra un cimitero di campagna tradotta dall'inglese in più lingue con varie cose finora inedite (Verona 1819). This included four translations into Latin, of which one was Christopher Anstey’s and another was Costa’s; eight into Italian, where versions in prose and terza rima accompanied those already mentioned by Torelli and Cesarotti; two in French, two in German and one each in Greek and Hebrew. Even more translations were eventually added in the new edition of 1843. By that time, too, John Martin’s illustrated edition of 1839 had appeared with translations into Latin, Greek, German, Italian and French, of which only the Torelli version had appeared in previous collections. What <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> all this activity is that, as the centenary of its first publication approached, interest in Gray’s Elegy continued unabated in Europe and new translations of it continued to be made.|$|E
25|$|According to the theory, {{accommodation}} is {{the process}} of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> the experience of failure, or others' failure.|$|E
25|$|In the Nineties, the Romancière {{had created}} a new hero, Venetian Prince, Aldo Morosini a kind of Simon Templar, his “Highness Aldo Morosini” expert on {{historic}} precious stones. The origination of the Aldo Morosini Novels is unique, as <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> the author herself in her foreword in the Novel Les Treize Vents (English: The thirteen Winds). She was asked by a famous French actor to write a script for an adventure story for a television series, {{with him in the}} leading role. The only condition he made: it should play in modern times and in Venice.|$|E

25|$|It was presumably at Lerins that Salvian {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of Honoratus (died 429), Hilary of Arles (died 449), and Eucherius of Lyons (died 449). That {{he was a}} friend of the former and wrote an account of his life <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> Hilary. To Eucherius's two sons, Salonius and Veranus, he acted as tutor in consort with Vincent of Lérins. As he succeeded Honoratus and Hilary in this office, this date cannot well be later than the year 426 or 427, when the former was called to Arles, whither he seems to have summoned Hilary before his death in 429.|$|E
25|$|In {{primitive}} Christian centuries, the popes {{carried on}} ecclesiastical government {{by means of}} an active and extensive correspondence. <b>We</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> a synod of the year 370, under Pope Damasus, that the minutes of their letters or decretals were kept in the papal archives; these Vatican Archives have perished up to the time of pope John VIII (died 882). In {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} attempts were made to reconstruct them. During the period under discussion (i. e. to the middle of the eleventh century) there was a constant use of the papal decretals by the compilers of canonical collections from the sixth century on.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of Beneventum under the Roman Empire was of very considerable extent. Towards the west it included that of Caudium, {{with the exception}} of the town itself; to the north it extended as far as the river Tamarus (modern Tammaro), including the village of Pago Veiano, which, as <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> an inscription, was anciently called Pagus Veianus; on the northeast it comprised the town of Aequum Tuticum (modern Sant'Eleuterio, near Castelfranco in Miscano), and on the east and south bordered on the territories of Aeclanum and Abellinum. An inscription has preserved to us the names of several of the pagi or villages dependent upon Beneventum, but their sites cannot be identified.|$|E

25|$|We hear {{little of}} Tyndaris under Roman government, {{but it appears}} to have been a flourishing and {{considerable}} city. Cicero calls it nobilissima civitas and <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> him that the inhabitants had displayed their zeal and fidelity towards the Romans upon many occasions. Among others they supplied naval forces for the armament of Scipio Africanus the Younger, a service for which he repaid them by restoring to them a statue of Mercury which had been carried off by the Carthaginians and which continued as an object of great veneration in the city, until it was stolen by the rapacious Verres. Tyndaris was also one of seventeen cities selected by the Roman senate, apparently as an honorary distinction, to contribute to certain offerings to the temple of Venus at Eryx. In other respects it had no peculiar privileges, and was in the condition of an ordinary municipal town, with its own magistrates, local senate, etc., but was certainly in the time of Cicero one of the most considerable places in the island. It, however, suffered severely from the exactions of Verres and the inhabitants, to revenge themselves on their oppressor, publicly demolished his statue as soon as he had quit the island.|$|E

The author regards Ahalya as an independent woman who makes her own decisions, takes risks and is driven by curiosity to experiment with the extraordinary and then accept the curse imposed on her by patriarchal society. It is this undaunted acceptance of the curse that makes the Ramayana praise and venerate her. V. R.

500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is {{what it feels like to}} believe that religion." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of {{the phrase}} as a {{reference}} to demagoguery and hypocrisy is traced to a Russian political joke about a dispute between an American and a Soviet man. After receiving criticism of his country beca{{use of the}} deaths caused by the 1905 anti-Jewish Kishinev pogrom, the Russian Ambassador to the United States pointed out [...] "Americans had recently lynched blacks". The Russian Ambassador said locals engaged in violence when drunk, [...] "just like Americans." [...] Soviet artist Dmitri Moor produced the lithograph Freedom to the Prisoners of Scottsboro!, after the 1931 trial of the Scottsboro Boys of Alabama. The treatment of the Scottsboro Boys popularized the phrase in usage by the Soviet Union against the U.S. {{as a form of}} criticism against those who themselves criticized human rights abuses. In his 1934 book Russia Today: What Can <b>We</b> <b>Learn</b> <b>from</b> It?, Sherwood Eddy wrote: [...] "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked {{what they are going to}} do to the Scottsboro Negro boys and why they lynch Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|For Satisfied, DecembeRadio made {{a concerted}} effort to write lyrics that were more {{uplifting}} than those featured on their previous album.

[...] We like to have fun onstage and in our lives, so we didn't want this album to be as dark as the last one." [...] To that end, the band wrote and included on Satisfied songs like [...] "Better Man", which Reedy says imparts that [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> our mistakes and follow Jesus Christ it will make us a better man", and the [...] "vertical worship song" [...] "For Your Glory". [...] The band was inspired to write [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] following the death of a friend of producer Scotty Wilbanks. [...] At the funeral, the man's widow stood over the casket praising God with arms raised amidst her sorrow. [...] "It struck a chord in our hearts to write a song about how, no matter what current problem we might be facing, God's love and mercy is always waiting there for us", said Reedy.|$|E
