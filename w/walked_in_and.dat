5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E
25|$|The new batsman Ricky Ponting <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{was greeted}} by Ajit Agarkar's {{beautiful}} first over, but Agarkar was quickly removed from the attack after some poor bowling resulted in damage of his figures which read: 5–1–40–0. Then having no other options, Ganguly turned towards the only spinner in his team, Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan had dismissed Ponting five times in the 2000–01 series and had troubled the Australians with 32 wickets in three tests, but this time his first ball was savagely cut by Langer, and then Ponting dealt {{with him in the}} same manner.|$|E
25|$|While she {{was playing}} one night in the Gaslight South, a club in Coconut Grove, Florida, David Crosby <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> was {{immediately}} struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist. He took her back to Los Angeles, where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends. Soon she was being managed by Elliot Roberts, who had a close business association with David Geffen. Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career. Crosby convinced a record company to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at the time, and his clout earned him a producer's credit in March 1968, when Reprise Records released her debut album, alternatively known as Joni Mitchell or Song to a Seagull.|$|E

However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for charges of armed robbery. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. Jerry Ray said that he had assisted his brother on one such robbery. [...] "I never been with nobody as bold as he is," [...] Jerry said.

500|$|In Southeastern Asia, golden jackals {{have been}} known to hunt {{alongside}} dhole packs. They have been observed in the Blackbuck National Park, Velavadar, India, following Indian wolves (Canis lupus pallipes) when these are on a hunt, and they will scavenge off wolf kills without any hostility shown from these wolves. In India, lone jackals expelled from their pack {{have been known}} to form commensal relationships with tigers. These solitary jackals, known as kol-bahl, will associate themselves with a particular tiger, trailing it at a safe distance to feed on the big cat's kills. A kol-bahl will even alert a tiger to prey with a loud [...] "pheal". Tigers {{have been known to}} tolerate these jackals, with one report describing how a jackal confidently <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out between three tigers walking together. Golden jackals and wild boar can occupy the same territory.|$|E

500|$|The Hebrew Bible {{records that}} Amon {{continued}} his father Manasseh's practice of idolatry {{and set up}} pagan images as his father had done.

And he walked in all the way that his father <b>walked</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them." [...] Similarly, II Chronicles records that [...] "…he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them." [...] The Talmudic tradition recounts that [...] "Amon burnt the Torah, and allowed spider webs to cover the altar ... Amon sinned very much."

Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's [...] "I Disappear". Ulrich <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just [...] "sharing" [...] by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was [...] "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, [...] "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." [...] Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.|$|E
500|$|From the start, Wilson {{envisioned a}} theremin for the track. AllMusic {{reviewer}} John Bush pointed out: [...] "Radio listeners could easily {{pick up the}} link between the title and the obviously electronic riffs sounding in the background of the chorus, but Wilson's use of the theremin added another delicious parallel—between the single's theme and its use of an instrument the player never even touched." [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] does not technically feature a theremin, but rather an Electro-Theremin, which is physically controlled by a knob {{on the side of the}} instrument. It was dubbed a [...] "theremin" [...] simply for convenience. At that time, theremins were most often associated with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock film Spellbound, but its most common presence was in the theme music for the television sitcom My Favorite Martian, which ran from 1963 to 1966. Britz speculates: [...] "He just <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I have this new sound for you.' I think he must have heard the sound somewhere and loved it, and built a song around it." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{resulted}} in a three-part comedic battle between the three faux-pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows on February 4, 2008. It all began {{on the set of}} The Daily Show, when Colbert, to thunderous applause, interrupted the middle of a seemingly normal show to thank Stewart for settling the feud. [...] Stewart at first responded happily to this, but then grew visibly frightened once Colbert informed him of O'Brien's response from a few days before. Colbert then began taunting O'Brien, calling him [...] "cheap", [...] "stupid" [...] and [...] "lazy"—much to Stewart's chagrin, who begged Colbert to stop. It was too late, however, as O'Brien, accompanied by thunderous applause, quickly <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> furiously scolded the two for keeping the feud going. [...] A seething Colbert, nonetheless, refused to back down, and even snarled at O'Brien: [...] "You want to tangle, Red?" [...] O'Brien agreed, but as the two prepared to take the fight outside, Stewart reminded them that he had to finish his show. O'Brien and Colbert agreed to wait outside, where they engaged in idle chit chat.|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to cast the role of Jason, Ari Lehman, who had {{received}} a part in Sean Cunningham's Manny's Orphans, arrived to read for the character of Jack. Before he could get started, Cunningham <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> offered him a different part: Jason. Without having read a single word, Cunningham just looked at Ari and said, [...] "You're the right size, you've got it." [...] In the original Friday the 13th, Ari Lehman is seen only in a brief flashback as the surprise ending. Subsequent actors who portrayed a young Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in Jason Takes Manhattan and Spencer Stump in Freddy vs. Jason. The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in their parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the lack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been stuntmen. The most well-known among them is Kane Hodder, who is cited as the best to play the role.|$|E
500|$|Uncle David {{was filmed}} over {{five days in}} October 2009 on the Isle of Sheppey, a {{location}} chosen for its proximity to London. Hoyle commented that the profusion of barbed wire fences there made him wonder if they were [...] "keeping people out or keeping people in?". Reich {{said that he had}} been [...] "obsessed" [...] with Sheppey, a place he had considered [...] "a truly Godforsaken wasteland" [...] since working on a television show there ten years previously. He remarked that the [...] "trailer trash setting" [...] of the film was influenced by Harmony Korine's Gummo (1997) and John Waters' Female Trouble (1974). He also said that the filming budget of under £1000 was a homage to [...] "the spirit of John Waters." [...] All the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of Sheppey, and to film a scene in a local cafe, they <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> asked the proprietors if they could shoot there. Although they had planned to tell any enquirers who approached them that they were shooting a horror film, during the shoot none of the locals expressed any interest in the crew's activities.|$|E

500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I <b>walked</b> <b>in.</b> <b>And</b> I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'"

500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." ...|$|E

Setting up in his kitchen, Mullen was on drums, with Paul Hewson ("Bono") on lead vocals; David Evans ("the Edge") and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar; Adam Clayton, a friend of the Evans {{brothers}} on bass guitar; and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen. Mullen later described it as [...] "'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> blew any chance I had of being in charge." [...] Martin, who had brought his guitar and amplifier to the first practice but could not play, did not remain with the group, and McCormick was dropped within a few weeks. The group settled on the name [...] "Feedback" [...] because {{it was one of the}} few technical terms they knew. Most of their initial material consisted of cover songs, which the band admitted was not their forte. Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts, such as the Jam, the Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols. The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to success.|$|E
