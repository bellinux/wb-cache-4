2500|$|Crater's dinner companions gave differing {{accounts}} of Crater's {{departure from the}} restaurant.

2500|$|A {{criminal}} investigation also began {{weeks after the}} shooting, when the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) forwarded {{the case to the}} state's attorney's office and the FBI. The U.S. attorney's office confirmed on April 13, 2015, that they had been conducting a federal {{criminal investigation}} of the McDonald case in conjunction with the state attorney's office, after contradictions were found between the initial police report and the dash-cam video. The police report said that McDonald had lunged at an officer, but the video footage showed that McDonald made no lunges. [...] The video does show that McDonald was swinging the knife in his right hand in a wide, but aimless manner as he <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and also appears to show that McDonald turns slightly to look briefly at Van Dyke and another officer who are pointing guns at him, but that he continues to walk away from both officers at the moment Van Dyke opens fire on him.|$|E

2500|$|For many decades, Brixton {{has had a}} {{reputation}} for cannabis use and the BBC has quoted a local resident as saying [...] "People have always smoked cannabis in Brixton – everyone knows that, people have <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> smoking spliffs for years." [...] This reputation was amplified by the [...] "softly softly" [...] police approach to cannabis that was piloted in Brixton in 2001 to 2005. Concerns were raised about [...] "drug tourism" [...] to the area. The [...] "softly-softly" [...] pilot occurred {{in the context of a}} wider debate in Britain about the classification of cannabis. Despite the pilot being stopped and replaced by a [...] "no deal" [...] policy, the Metropolitan Police was in favour of a reclassification of cannabis from class B to class C. Cannabis was officially reclassified in Britain from a class B down to a class C drug in early 2004. In January 2009 the UK government reclassified cannabis back to a class B drug.|$|E
