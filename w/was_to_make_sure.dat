5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E
5|$|After the shipwreck, Grill {{remained}} in Canton as resident supercargo for seven years. As such {{he was the}} company's representative in Canton, contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships. He was supercargo {{for the arrival of}} three more ships of the SIOC: the Stockholms Slott (outward journey) in 1762, the Stockholms Slott (resident supercargo in Canton) in 1765 and the Cron Prins Gustaf (journey home) 1768. One of his tasks in Canton <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained. The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well, but the one on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building. Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight into life in Canton at that time.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E

That <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that requirements truly correspond to stakeholders' intentions before resources <b>are</b> committed <b>to</b> development. The second task of the validation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an assessment whether the requirements are feasible. Traditional techniques for validation include reviews of requirements documents and building early system models and prototypes.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Toshiyuki Itahana. In common with his typical drawing style for characters, Itahana created Wol to be a heroic fantasy character that both fitted within and did not conform to earlier Final Fantasy titles. He and other designers created the multiple job outfits to further convey the fantasy setting. After its reveal, some changes {{were made to the}} character's initial costume: due to negative player feedback about the amount of skin shown, the Onion Swordsman outfit was adjusted to be more covering. The game's environments were designed by Takako Miyake, who had previously worked on console Final Fantasy titles. She did not change her working style for Mobius Final Fantasy: all the assets were designed in high definition, and only adjusted slightly when they were brought into the mobile environment. The visual effects were handled by company veteran Shintaro Takai, whose main preoccupation <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the game did not slow down during the flashier visual combat effects due to hardware constraints. The cutscenes were not affected by these issues.|$|E

Hillel director Robert Fishman and several Jewish students conspiring to control the Q session. According to Hennessey, a handout was distributed with negative questions and then the students strategically grabbed the seats closest to the microphones. Hennessey said that he overheard people in the group saying that the point of their strategy <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that Carter, whose book, Palestine Peace Not Apartheid, faced only tough questions.|$|E

25|$|González {{explained}} in detail how Roxana Baldetti's front companies worked, a version that remained unaltered across the lengthy questioning {{of lawyers and}} procesutors: González was hired to manage seven companies. Other companies controlled by Víctor Hugo Hernández, Juan Carlos Monzón's trusted employee. González explained that his job <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that all these front companies had offices that reflected the capital that they allegedly had and the services that {{they were supposed to}} offer; he also looked for mock stockholders and board members that fit the profile for the supposed type of companies.|$|E
25|$|The initial DMK {{movies were}} not victims of {{censorship}} since {{the party was}} little known to the censors, but as the party gained popularity in mid-1950s censorship became stronger. According to Murasoli Maran one of the techniques followed by the censors <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the coherence of the movie was lost {{so that it was}} a box office failure. At one point DMK, having had been a target of high censorship, had to move back to stage dramas. But the Dramatic Licensing Act brought censorship to stage plays as well, and two of Karunanidhi's plays were banned.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> no agreements were ever reached.|$|E

500|$|During filming, {{artificial}} snow {{had to be}} continuously shoveled on the sets because {{the cast and crew}} kept trampling through it. Steve Oben, the costume set supervisor for the series, jokingly called the Fortress of Solitude the [...] "Fortress of Styrofoam" [...] and explained that a huge hurdle for the scenes in the fortress <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the synthetic snow would not stick to the actors during filming.|$|E
500|$|Castellon {{said that}} he did not want the SSL's {{internal}} automation to interfere with his blending of the music, instead used Pro Tools, with automatic levels. According to him, he [...] "then ran everything through the SSL, on which [...] did EQ, compression and panning." [...] The mixing of the track was made at The Hit Factory studio, in Miami on a 96-channel SSL J-series desk. Considering the quantity of recorded backing tracks, Castellon's challenge <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the music did not overpower the vocals. He accomplished this by first mixing the vocals, then adding the music and the drums, which was an unusual method for him. Minimal digital plug-ins were employed for the mix as Castellon preferred the sound of outboard gear.|$|E
500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we wanted to do <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight.

Spoken For is filled with songs that I pray the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There. Millard said [...] of the origin of the album title: [...] "Over the last year I’ve been consumed with the idea that God is so crazy in love with us—just knowing that we are part of something bigger and we worship a God who’s in complete control no matter how good or bad things get.

500|$|The crew {{spent a long}} {{amount of}} time {{plotting}} out the episode in a room, using sticky notes, {{in order to make}} sure it played out sensibly and was clearly understandable to viewers. The production staff based a lot of the usage of time travel in [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" [...] on those from the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990) and H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1960). The goal of the crew <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> everything stayed strong to a certain logical standpoint, which led to several surreal conversations, including several paradoxes involving time travel. The crew members sought to venture into elements that seemed complicated, as their children viewers were deemed intelligent enough to understand such elements.

500|$|Proponents of the Bricker Amendment {{said this}} {{language}} made it essential {{to add to}} the Constitution explicit limitations on the treaty-making power. Raymond Moley wrote in 1953 that Holland meant [...] "the protection of an international duck takes precedence over the constitutional protections of American citizens". In response, legal scholars such as Professor Edward Samuel Corwin of Princeton University said the language of the Constitution regarding treaties—"under the authority of the United States"—was misunderstood by Holmes, and was written to protect the 1783 peace treaty with Britain; this became [...] "in part the source of Senator Bricker's agitation". Professor Zechariah Chafee of Harvard Law School wrote, [...] "the Framers never talked about having treaties on the same level as the Constitution. What they did want <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> a state could no longer flout any lawful action taken by the nation". Chafee claimed that the word [...] "Supreme", as used in ArticleVI, simply meant [...] "supreme over the states".|$|E

You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{cancellation}} of the PC version {{at the same time}} as the Xbox 360 release as a result of Microsoft's decision, Remedy's Oskari Häkkinen stated that [...] "PC gaming is part of Remedy's heritage" [...] and that the developers still wanted to release a PC version of the game. Remedy continued pressing Microsoft to allow the creation of a PC version, eventually gaining it in mid-2011; Häkkinen attributed Microsoft's agreement partially to their repeated requests, but as well as Remedy's good standing with Microsoft, and the time factor, having the PC version be available ahead of American Nightmare. Development of the PC version began in earnest, with a small team from Remedy working with Finnish independent developer Nitro Games. Instead of starting from the scrapped PC version, the team worked from the Xbox 360 code and added in new features to take advantage of more powerful elements on modern PC machines. Core to the PC version <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the game played well using typical keyboard and mouse controls in addition to a controller, and to assure the graphics exceeded the limitations of the Xbox 360; Matias Myllyrinne, Remedy's CEO, stated that these elements were important, as [...] "If this is not tuned to perfection, all the visuals are lost and the emotional touchstones are missed". The PC version was completed in about five months, and the game formally announced to the public in December 2011.|$|E
