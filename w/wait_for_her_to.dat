500|$|The {{ship was}} moved to Wilhelmshaven over the summer under British control while the {{division}} of the surviving warships was decided among the victorious Allies. While this was being argued the ships were [...] with a small maintenance crew aboard to preserve their value. The Allied Tripartite Commission allocated Ihn to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945. By this time she had developed some problems with her boilers and the British proposed to swap her for Theodor Reidel to avoid forcing the Soviets to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be repaired. They refused and Ihn was repaired more quickly than had been estimated with additional spare boiler parts loaded aboard for the voyage.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez met Mercedes Barcha {{while she}} was at school; they decided to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> finish before getting married. [...] When {{he was sent to}} Europe as a foreign correspondent, Mercedes waited for him to return to Barranquilla. Finally they married in 1958. The {{following}} year, their first son, Rodrigo García, now a television and film director, was born. In 1961, the family traveled by Greyhound bus throughout the southern United States and eventually settled in Mexico City. García Márquez had always wanted to see the Southern United States because it inspired the writings of William Faulkner. Three years later the couple's second son, Gonzalo, was born in Mexico. Gonzalo is currently a graphic designer in Mexico City.|$|E
500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his arm around her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.|$|E
60|$|He <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> continue. She {{seemed to}} be in some difficulty.|$|R
60|$|She hesitated. He bent the slipper slowly back, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> proceed.|$|R
6000|$|He merely said, [...] "Well, well!" [...] and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak further. But her impulse had {{exhausted}} itself, as if {{her spirit}} were {{like one of those}} weak forms of life which spend their strength in a quick run or flight, and then rest to gather force for another. [...] "Where's Boyne?" [...] he asked, after <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|R
2500|$|... "The boat I was in {{was picked}} up by the Carpathia at 7 a.m. on Monday, we having rowed three miles to her, as we could not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come up on account of our boat taking in so much water that we would not have stayed afloat much longer." ...|$|E
60|$|Julian did not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> answer him. He considerately went on.|$|E
60|$|Angela {{shook her}} head with a gesture of doubt, {{but he did not}} <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> answer.|$|E
60|$|She {{was aware}} of Will's eyes shining {{steadily}} upon <b>her,</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|R
60|$|Mose {{took the}} chair {{opposite}} {{and looked at}} <b>her</b> smilelessly. He <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> move.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her almost in fear. In silence, not daring <b>to</b> speak, he <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> continue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite identically and {{absolutely}} the very----" [...] began the fatter sister, {{but she was}} constructing her sentence on too large a scale, and the little one would not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> finish it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> tell me. She is {{an honest}} child, {{and the truth}} will soon come out," [...] thought Mrs. Minot, as she took a clean sheet, and Jill tried to study.|$|E
60|$|Evidently she had {{not found}} it {{when they reached the}} {{dividing}} of the ways that led to her quarters and to his. Still swinging his hand, still buoyantly chattering fun, she continued with him into his workroom. Here he surrendered. He had neither heart nor energy to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> develop whatever she contemplated.|$|E
60|$|Frona {{lay back}} in her chair and lazily {{regarded}} <b>her</b> visitor, Lucile <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak. It was very quiet.|$|R
60|$|I <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{remark that}} the late Count Scarabelli {{was also a}} saint in paradise, but I waited in vain.|$|R
60|$|Ellie, Hector, and Lady Utterword are left. Hector {{is close}} to Lady Utterword. They look at Ellie, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he answered. [...] "It {{shall be}} as you say." [...] He did not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> ring, {{nor did he}} attempt any sort of farewell. He simply took up his hat, and before she could realise his {{intention}} {{he had left the}} room. Lucille sat quite still, looking into the fire.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be more explicit. Knowing what I knew now, {{the memory of}} Miss Fairlie's look and manner at the breakfast-table {{told me that the}} {{expected}} visitor at Limmeridge House was her future husband. I tried to force it back; but something rose within me at that moment stronger than my own will, and I interrupted Miss Halcombe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] he echoed bitterly. [...] "Ay, {{wait until}} the poor girl shall hear--perhaps from her brother's lips--the story of my {{marriage}} as bandied about by others; <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> know {{that the man who}} would have made her love him was another's, and unworthy of her respect? No! it is I who must leave this place, and at once." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Brice remonstrated mildly, to {{the effect}} that he had done his share of {{political}} work. He scarcely <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> finish.|$|R
6000|$|... "She gained time, as you see. While I <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{interfere}} {{you were}} marching away, {{and she was}} really beating the drum." ...|$|R

60|$|On the morrow {{he was up}} {{bright and}} early, glad {{that he had a}} {{surprise}} for Bess. He could hardly <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come out. Presently she appeared and walked under the spruce. Then she approached the camp-fire. There was a tinge of healthy red in the bronze of her cheeks, and her slender form had begun to round out in graceful lines.|$|E
60|$|Long {{before the}} sun had begun to slant westward toward the mid-afternoon Jean Isbel had set as a meeting time Ellen {{directed}} her steps through the forest to the Rim. She felt ashamed of her eagerness. She had a guilty conscience that no strange thrills could silence. It {{would be fun to}} see him, to watch him, to let him <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> fool him.|$|E
6000|$|With sudden {{resolution}} he {{ran down}} the stairway and over to the telephone booth on the corner. He got the butler at once, and was deeply relieved to find {{that his mother was}} out with Mrs. Joyce. [...] "He can't see her before I do," [...] he concluded, as he hung up the receiver. [...] "I'll go over there and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> return." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{sat with}} their arms twined around each other, and in the pause her mother patted <b>her</b> hand and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go on.|$|R
60|$|The {{man made}} no reply but stood, a strong, dark figure, a yard {{or two from}} the well, as though <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> join him.|$|R
60|$|And, without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak, he {{commanded}} {{that his daughter}} should be walled up in the summer-house and starved <b>to</b> death with <b>her</b> lover.|$|R
60|$|When {{the little}} model came {{walking up the}} garden on her usual visit, he fancied her face looked scared. Quieting the {{growling}} of Miranda, who from the first had stubbornly refused to know this girl, he sat down with a book to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go away. After sitting an hour or more, turning over pages, and knowing little of their sense, he saw a man peer over his garden gate. He was there for half a minute, then lounged across the road, and stood hidden by some railings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Bolton!" [...] Annie called out, {{when she}} entered her house, and she pushed on into the kitchen; she had not the {{patience}} to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> bring in the dinner before speaking about the exciting event at church. But Mrs. Bolton would not be {{led up to the}} subject by a tacit invitation, and after a suspense in which her zeal for Mr. Peck began to take a colour of resentment toward Mrs. Bolton, Annie demanded, [...] "What do you think of Mr. Gerrish's scandalous behaviour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She'll be a beauty," [...] {{reflected}} Miss Rosetta complacently. [...] "Jane was {{a handsome}} girl. She shall always be dressed as nice as I can manage it, and I'll get her an organ, and have her take painting and music lessons. Parties, too! I'll give her a real coming-out party when she's eighteen and the very prettiest dress that's to be had. Dear me, I can hardly <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> grow up, though she's sweet enough now to make one wish she could stay a baby forever." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{paused for}} so long that Poppy Tyrell looked up from her work, said [...] "Yes," [...] in an expressionless manner, and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> continue.|$|R
60|$|For some {{minutes more}} they paced the walks {{at the end}} of the garden in silence, he <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak, she unable to say anything.|$|R
