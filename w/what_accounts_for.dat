En mängd olika begrepp används om vartannat och några klara definitioner finns inte fastlagda. Syftet med denna studie är därför att göra en kartläggning av de olika begrepp som används inom den globala, akademiska hållbarhetsredovisningslitteraturen för att utreda innebörden av dessa begrepp samt för att utreda hur dessa begrepp förhåller sig till varandra. Studien genomförs med hjälp av en litteraturstudie där 12 artiklar väljs ut genom ett intensitetsurval och sedan analyseras och jämförs med varandra. Resultatet av detta blir en kartläggning där de olika begreppens betydelse och inbördes relationer utrönas.

The study is conducted by performing a study of literature where 12 articles are chosen with the help of an intensity sample. Thereafter the articles are analyzed and compared. This results in a clarification of the meaning of the terms and concepts, and of the internal relations in between them.  The study leads to the establishment of five main terms and concepts within the area; sustainability reporting/accounting, TBL reporting/accounting, CSR reporting, FCA and environmental accounting that together can be seen to form a foundation of <b>what</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> sustainability really is...|$|R
