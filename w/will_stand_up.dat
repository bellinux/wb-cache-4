25|$|When the Eisenhower Administration {{took office}} {{one of its}} first {{objectives}} was to riddle the tax code with favors for big business and it did so {{with the help of}} the Senator from Massachusetts.

We need a courageous candidate who <b>will</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> and fight the necessary political battle for the welfare of the average American. Kennedy has never been willing to do that.|$|E
25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates.

When Elphaba arrives at class the next day, Fiyero sees Galinda's influence, and tells Elphaba that she doesn't need to change.

Elphaba's outrage cannot be contained, and in the ensuing chaos, she and Fiyero grab the Lion cub ("Cowardly Lion") in the cage and escape.|$|E

During a presidential primary debate in 2011, he said that efforts to reduce classroom size were a ploy by teachers unions to promote the hiring of more teachers; and he vowed, “as president, I <b>will</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> to the National Teachers Unions.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Bud Bundy (David Faustino)—the younger Bundy offspring, and {{the most}} {{intelligent}} family member; the first Bundy to attend college. His awkwardness and preoccupation with sex leads to inevitable failures with women. To improve his success with girls, Bud often uses his alternate persona, [...] "Grandmaster B," [...] a bad-boy rapper from New York City. When using the [...] "Grandmaster B" [...] persona, Bud usually wears dark sunglasses and a backward Los Angeles Raiders hat. His mistreatment {{at the hands of}} Kelly is returned in kind, making jokes at her expense regarding her promiscuity and stupidity, and tricking her into mixing up TV shows with novels; but when she is in a legitimate bind, Bud <b>will</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> for her, much like Kelly does for him under similar circumstances.|$|E

It was stated that at least 24 of the aircraft would be available by 2023 for use on board one of the navy's aircraft carriers, thus leaving more time for testing and training before it becomes operational.
