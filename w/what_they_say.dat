5|$|In 1975, {{after working}} in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow {{returned}} to the US with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair {{of male and female}} kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.|$|E

Chai had written, among other things, the words [...] "Anti Stuckism" [...] on his bare back. Fiachra Gibbons of The Guardian wrote (in 1999) that the event [...] "will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement."

500|$|Carte {{was deeply}} {{affected}} {{by the death of}} his son Michael in 1932, discussed below. [...] The actor Martyn Green said, [...] "The heart dropped right out of him. [...] His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away." [...] Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Henry Lytton. [...] Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures, but his only new stage production after 1932 was of The Yeomen of the Guard designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, [...] "I don't care <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> about the production.

500|$|Smith {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 1986 on the [...] "semi-promise" [...] {{of a part}} in a TV film. After the audition, the role was given to another actress.

In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of Living on Salvation Street, for which she was paid $14 for each performance, Boys and Girls/Men and Women, and How the Other Half Loves, and played the recurring role of Louella Waters on the Showtime series Brothers. She appeared in the films The Legend of Billie Jean and Ginger Ale Afternoon (1989) as [...] "trailer-park girls".

500|$|Although Jack had tattoos {{on his arm}} {{the entire}} series, their origin had never been explained. Matthew Fox {{received}} the tattoos before Lost was even created. The producers considered putting make-up over them, but instead, decided just to keep them and fit it in with the plot. According to Assistant Professor Xinping Zhu of Northeastern University, the tattoo {{is made up of}} four Chinese characters from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1925. Fox's tattoo translates to [...] "Eagles high up, cleaving the space". (In this episode however, one of [...] "the Others" [...] tells Jack that his tattoo translates as: [...] "He walks among us, but he is not one of us." [...] Jack replies, [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> that's not what they mean.") [...] The number 5 can also be seen on Fox's forearm; he got that tattoo while working on Party of Five, along with another cast member. In an interview, Fox said that for him, getting a tattoo was a [...] "pretty intense experience", and something he would not do in the [...] "spur of the moment". He thought Jack having tattoos was a [...] "really cool idea". Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos.|$|E
500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E
500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I always {{like to work with}} {{different}} people on each project I do, just so you get a different sound and angle. I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, you know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E
