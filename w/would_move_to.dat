5|$|In 2003 reports emerged that, {{as part of}} {{the plans}} for the renewal of its Royal Charter, the BBC was {{considering}} moving whole channels or strands of production from London to Manchester. Early discussions involved a plan where the BBC <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> a new media village proposed by Granada Television at its Bonded Warehouse site at Granada Studios in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan to take}} Bapaume {{involved}} the 1st Infantry Brigade, positioned at Grévillers, moving {{to the south of}} Bapaume with the 63rd Division moving forward to protect the right flank of the New Zealanders. Meanwhile, the 2nd Infantry Brigade <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> the north of the town. Its left flank would be protected by the 37th Division. Their aim was to envelop Bapaume and force the Germans to abandon the town and thus avoid costly street to street fighting.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} {{what would become the}} {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown. In Manitoba, he would take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which he would establish prominence in. After doing work for the railway, he <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Winnipeg where he would join a contracting firm and become involved in the construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, Manitoba, May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E

5|$|After {{agreement}} {{from the}} Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold {{of the south}} ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968. Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Sophia Gardens and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would {{move out of the}} south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|As the US X Corps {{was pushing}} towards the reservoir, the Chinese {{formulated}} their strategy, {{based on their}} experiences in the Chinese Civil War. Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence {{would be at the}} reservoir, the Chinese 9th Corps Army was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, then push towards Hagaru-ri. Believing the bulk of the US X Corps <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Army would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for the battle, with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{remained}} a Senator while {{each of his}} appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> expel him if he appeared in the Senate. However, Burton did appear in the Senate after his conviction. On April 6, 1904, Burton appeared to push for appropriations for the acquisition {{of land in the}} Adirondacks and Catskills. On January 22, 1906, Burton appeared in the Senate chamber again, for 30 seconds, in order to be eligible for $1,000 in travel reimbursements from the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Dahl {{announced}} on October 29, 2007 that he <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> mornings at WJMK on November 5, 2007 as WCKG changed formats. He {{was the only}} live personality at the Jack FM outlet {{as the rest of}} the station was pre-programmed and run by computer. Dahl's son Matt was part of the regular WCKG lineup and hosted the show immediately following his father's. However, the WCKG format change, from an FM talk station to an adult contemporary station meant the end of Matt's show on WCKG.|$|E
5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, {{in spite of his}} conservative militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of his}} ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> liberalize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the Victoria Skating Club {{sold the}} rink, {{dissolving}} the Club. Ice skating continued {{under the new}} ownership, and on December 19, 1908, the Earl Grey Skating Club was founded at the Victoria Rink. In a ceremony at the rink, the club's patron, Governor-General Albert Grey formally initiated the club. Club honorary president Sir H. Montagu Allan and Lady Evelyn Grey {{were the first to}} appear on the ice. Mrs. Helen Joseph became the president of the Club. The Earl Grey Club <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> the Montreal Arena by 1911.|$|E

50|$|In {{hopes of}} getting a better signal, WSUN-TV tried to swap {{frequencies}} with Tampa Bay's new educational television station, WEDU, in the late 1950s. Under the proposed deal, WSUN-TV <b>would</b> have <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> channel 3, while WEDU <b>would</b> have <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> channel 38 and kept WSUN-TV's old equipment. However, WEDU turned down this proposal.|$|R
5|$|In late 1903, a {{baseball}} column {{suggested that the}} Detroit Tigers were interested in Shay, but he {{was said to be}} happy playing in California. During Shay's tenure in San Francisco, he got married. Shay went to spring training with the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1904 season. He impressed the team, prompting speculation that shortstop Dave Brain <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> third base and third baseman Jimmy Burke would serve as a utility infielder. Shay played 99 games for the Cardinals in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Morris Casriel Katz, {{a native}} of Felosveresmart, Czechoslovakia (now Velika Kopana, Ukraine) was rabbi from 1923 to 1926, his first pulpit before moving to Agudath Achim of Shreveport, Louisiana. Alexander Sandor Wiesel, a Chicago native, was rabbi in 1934. He had {{previously}} served at Brith Achim Synagogue in Petersburg, Virginia, and <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> House of Israel Synagogue in Calgary, Alberta. Benjamin G. Eisenberg served as rabbi from 1938 until at least 1942. By then membership had dropped to around 60 member families.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} was delivered on 1 August 1998. While {{the new airport}} at Gardermoen would not officially open until 8 October, when also SAS and Braathens <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> the airport, Color Air started flights from Gardermoen to Ålesund Airport, Vigra on 6 August. Flights to Trondheim Airport, Værnes commenced on 8 August, while the Bergen Airport, Flesland-route started 15 August. After a week, very few passengers were traveling with Color Air, with two at the least and twenty-four at the most per departure. Color Air was losing NOK650,000 per week of operation.|$|E

5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
5|$|Having {{completed}} his pre-flight training in March 1943, Glenn was commissioned {{as a second}} lieutenant. After advanced training at Camp Kearny, California, {{he was assigned to}} Marine Squadron VMJ-353 and flew R4D transport planes. Glenn was posted to the Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California in July 1943 and joined VMO-155, which flew the F4F Wildcat fighter. The Wildcat was obsolete by this time, and VMO-155 re-equipped with the F4U Corsair in September 1943. He was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1943, and shipped out to Hawaii in January 1944. It was intended that VMO-155 <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> the Marshall Islands but this was delayed, and on February 21 it moved to Midway Atoll and became part of the garrison. This had been the site of the Battle of Midway in 1942, but was a backwater by this time. VMO-155 moved to the Marshall Islands in June 1944, and flew 57 combat missions in the area. He received two Distinguished Flying Crosses and ten Air Medals.|$|E
5|$|Holby City and Casualty {{are both}} set in Holby City Hospital, in the fictional county of Wyvern, in the {{southwest}} of England close to the Welsh border. The city exterior is represented by Bristol, though Holby City is filmed at BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough to encompass the surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, and as a result, some crossover scenes in the first episode had to be shot twice, first on the Casualty set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. In October 2007, BBC cutbacks led The Daily Telegraph to report that the Elstree site would be sold, and Holby City relocated to share a set with Casualty, possibly in Cardiff. In March 2009, the BBC confirmed that Casualty <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> a new set in Cardiff, however in the following month, The Guardian announced that the BBC would retain Elstree Studios {{for at least another}} four years.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor, {{a position he}} held until his appointment as the school's second president in 1896. Hall had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. As president, Hall was noted for his aggressive fundraising and improvements to the school, including his special project, the A. French Textile School. In February 1899, Georgia Tech opened the first textile engineering school in the Southern United States, with $10,000 from the Georgia General Assembly, $20,000 of donated machinery, and $13,500 from supporters. It named the A. French Textile School after its chief donor and supporter, Aaron S. French. The textile engineering program <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> the Harrison Hightower Textile Engineering Building in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Arsenal {{suffered}} their heaviest league {{defeat in}} 84 years as they lost 8–2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal had not lost a league game {{by such a}} margin since 1927 when they lost 7–0 to West Ham United in the old Football League First Division. This {{was also the first}} time they had conceded eight goals in a game since 1896, when they lost 8–0 to the now defunct Loughborough in the old Football League Second Division. A year later, striker Robin van Persie joined United, having stated that he would not renew his contract with Arsenal. It was speculated that he <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> a club overseas, but signed for the Manchester club, the first Arsenal player to do so since Viv Anderson in 1987. Ferguson called Wenger to push through a deal when he learnt of the contract situation. Van Persie was instrumental in United's league win of 2012–13 – Ferguson's last, and coincidentally received a guard of honour by his former teammates before United faced Arsenal at the Emirates in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it <b>would</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E

5000|$|Mary and her {{children}} lived in New York City until 1820. Then, after a four-month visit back to England, they <b>would</b> then <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Sing Sing, NY on the Hudson River for [...] "four years of congenial repose". In 1824, they <b>would</b> <b>move</b> back <b>to</b> New York City for a season of [...] "special revival" [...] where brothers Octavius, Isaac, and George would become converted and later convinced of God’s calling to ministry.|$|R
