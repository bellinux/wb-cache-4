50|$|Baxter accuses Beach {{in front}} of Emsworth, {{and the three of}} them head to the cottage, Emsworth growing ever <b>warier</b> <b>of</b> Baxter's sanity. They find no pig, Carmody having moved it to Baxter's caravan, where Pilbeam, also caught in the rain, saw him stow it. While Emsworth, Lady Constance, Gally and Millicent go to dinner with Parsloe-Parsloe (lured away to leave the memoirs unguarded), Ronnie Fish confronts Pilbeam, and learns that Sue was indeed out in London with Carmody, and that she has come to Blandings to be near Ronnie.|$|R

5|$|The thinly {{stretched}} 2nd Panzer Army {{stood in}} the way of this Soviet force. The German commanders had been <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> such an attack and forces were quickly withdrawn from the Kursk offensive to meet the Soviet offensive.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brezhnev's {{failures}} in domestic reforms, his {{foreign affairs and}} defense policies turned the Soviet Union into a superpower. His popularity among citizens lessened during his last years, {{and support for the}} ideals of communism and Marxism-Leninism waned, even if the majority of Soviet citizens remained <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> liberal democracy and multi-party systems in general.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its role}} in {{establishing}} the General Synod, the Pennsylvania Ministerium withdrew from the inter-Lutheran organization in 1823. Within the Ministerium, there was a close relationship between Lutheran and Reformed congregations, and many felt that the General Synod might jeopardize that relationship. In addition, many in the Ministerium were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> a centralized organization, and the control that it might exert over individual congregations.|$|E
50|$|Having four {{reproductive}} females, A4 pod can {{be recognized}} by its large proportion of young calves and juveniles. They are much <b>warier</b> <b>of</b> boats than other pods and often prefer to stay far away from them despite being more tolerant than in the 1980s. They {{are one of the}} most commonly encountered groups of orcas, mostly due to their preference for the Johnstone Strait region during the summer and fall and are often seen with other Northern Resident pods, especially A1 and A5 pods which appear to be very closely related to one another. A4 pod is the only resident pod to frequently feed on pink salmon; other residents prefer the larger, fatter Chinook salmon.|$|R
60|$|The colts were a fuzzy, ungraceful lot at this season. Even {{the best}} of them had big bellies and carried dirty and tangled manes, but as the grazing improved, as the warmth and plenty of May filled their veins with new blood, they {{sloughed}} off their mangy coats and lifted their wide-blown nostrils to the western wind in exultant return to freedom. Many of them had never felt the weight of a man's hand, and even those that had wintered in and around the barn-yard soon lost all trace of domesticity. It was not unusual to find that the wildest and <b>wariest</b> <b>of</b> all the leaders bore a collar mark or some other ineffaceable badge of previous servitude.|$|R
50|$|As the baby's birth approaches, nerves {{among the}} parents and {{grandparents}} become frayed. The eventual birth of a baby boy delights everyone, except Stanley, a distant and <b>wary</b> observer <b>of</b> the as-yet-unnamed baby, who starts to cry whenever Stanley comes near him.|$|R
5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position. He was <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled this charge against such films as The Night Porter.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm, <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> a British counterattack, and {{concerned}} about the fatigue of his troops {{after a long day}} of battle, had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines. The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses in anticipation of a renewed attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} one of the first large {{properties}} acquired by the National Trust; it was not anticipated just how expensive repairs and maintenance would be, and even thirty years later it was still used as an example of why the Trust should be <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> taking on other country houses.|$|E
60|$|When {{we reached}} the poorer parts of the city, I {{observed}} that the free-and-easy swagger, and the jaunty hopping of each hind-leg alternately, gave place to a sedate walk and a <b>wary</b> turn <b>of</b> the head, which suggested keen suspicious glances of the unseen eyes.|$|R

5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter necked and more <b>wary.</b> Members <b>of</b> Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.|$|R
5|$|The red-capped robin {{typically}} perches in {{a prominent}} location {{low to the}} ground, often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> human contact.|$|E
5|$|They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott {{had sent}} Zelda his mother's ring, {{and the two}} had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and {{members of her family}} were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's {{excessive}} drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like {{the fact that he was}} a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the FROLINAT, Gaddafi {{had come}} to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding. On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president Fran√ßois Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians.|$|E
50|$|Following the Spellplague in 1385 DR, Evermeet changed dramatically. Most of Evermeet's {{population}} was {{transported to the}} Feywild's version of the isle, leaving the original island deserted yet pristine. Numerous fey crossings facilitated transportation between the prime and fey isles, but the increased isolation made the eladrin (as most sun and many moon elves took to calling themselves) even <b>warier</b> <b>of</b> visitors, {{and more and more}} of the mainland elven peoples chose to remain amongst the other races in Faerun proper. Queen Amlaruil disappeared at some point following the Spellplague, and Leuthilspar was governed by a council of the prominent houses. A sect of warlocks dedicated to preserving the isle as a refuge for elves and eladrin also emerged. By 1479 DR, Evermeet had all but passed into legend, visited only by adventurers seeking power or knowledge.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 two {{national}} programs Woods' worked on at NIGMS, the Minority Access to Research Careers Program (MARC) and the Minority Biomedical Research Support Program (MBRS), were finally initiated, {{though she had}} trouble persuading administrators at Black colleges to get involved. At that point many were <b>wary</b> because <b>of</b> the long years they'd {{been out of the}} spotlight.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{always had}} liked Taug. Since {{childhood}} they had romped together. Side by side they had squatted near the water, their quick, strong fingers ready to leap forth and seize Pisah, the fish, should that <b>wary</b> denizen <b>of</b> the cool depths dart surfaceward to {{the lure of}} the insects Tarzan tossed upon the face of the pool.|$|R

5|$|With {{the draft}} screenplay, Doran pitched {{the idea to}} various studios in order to finance the film, but found that many were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the {{beginner}} Thompson as the screenwriter. She was considered a risk, as her experience was as an actress who had never written a film script. Columbia Pictures executive Amy Pascal supported Thompson's work, and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
60|$|The dresser-drawer in {{the pantry}} {{contained}} a choice selection of miscellaneous objects--a pack of cards being among them. In searching for the cards, the <b>wary</b> hand <b>of</b> the head-waiter {{came in contact with}} a morsel of crumpled-up paper. He drew it out, and recognized the letter which he had picked up in the sitting-room some hours since.|$|R
60|$|Detecting {{the gleam}} of Governor Bellingham's lamp, the old lady quickly {{extinguished}} her own, and vanished. Possibly, she went up among the clouds. The minister saw nothing further of her motions. The magistrate, after a <b>wary</b> observation <b>of</b> the darkness--into which, nevertheless, he could see but little further than he might into a mill-stone--retired from the window.|$|R
50|$|External shocks also {{affected}} the Argentine currency board. The {{first was the}} Mexican crisis of 1994-1995, resulting in a liquidity crunch that drove interest rates sharply higher, stalling growth and spurring unemployment. In quick succession, the ensuing 1997 Asian and 1998 Russian financial crises pounded at the economy by further increasing interest rates as foreign investors became much <b>warier</b> <b>of</b> where they invested their assets, continuing to keep the cost of borrowing high for Argentina. The Brazilian crisis of 1999 probably had the most severe effect, because Brazil is Argentina's largest trading partner, and the crisis was coupled with an appreciating U.S. dollar and a slump in the world prices of primary products. Argentina's competitiveness in world markets was severely hit, given the peso's link to the appreciating U.S. dollar and weakening demand in its northern trading partner. As a result, the economy stalled and subsequently contracted.|$|R
5|$|After Plunder the II Canadian Corps, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Guy Simonds, struck west and seized Emmerich, approaching the IJssel from the east. Crerar {{saw an opportunity}} to take Arnhem and open a route between the city and Zutphen to the north, and ordered his two Corps commanders to coordinate their advances accordingly. However, he was <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> trying to seize Arnhem before the IJssel had been bridged further north.|$|E
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de B√©xar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> trying to defend a fixed position ‚Äì the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his junior}} college career, two {{universities}} offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{public opinion}} in order to explore the politics of immigration in South Korea. It argues that there are divergent views about immigration and the obligations of the host society to accommodate migrants. Younger, better-educated citizens are representative of a majority that has a generally positive view of immigrants and immigration. A sizeable minority of older and less well-educated citizens, however, is <b>warier</b> <b>of</b> immigration {{and its effects on}} South Korean society. Men were more likely than women to have a positive view of immigration, but the differences along gender lines were small. The article also finds that attitudes towards immigration depend to a significant degree on how migrants are described. It thereby highlights the possibility that South Korea‚Äôs leaders could use immigration for political gain while also seeking to attract new migrants in order to resolve the country‚Äôs economic and demographic problems...|$|R
