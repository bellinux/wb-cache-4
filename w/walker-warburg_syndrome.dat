5000|$|BFPP is a cobblestone-like {{cortical}} malformation of the brain. Disruptions of cerebral cortical development due to abnormal neuronal {{migration and}} positioning usually lead to cortical disorders, which includes cobblestone lissencephaly. Cobblestone lissencephaly is typically seen {{in three different}} human congenital muscular dystrophy syndromes: Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, <b>Walker-Warburg</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and muscle-eye-brain disease. [...] In cobblestone lissencephaly, the brain surface actually has a bumpy contour caused {{by the presence of}} collections of misplaced neurons and glial cells that have migrated beyond the normal surface boundaries of the brain. Sometimes regions populated by these misplaced cells have caused a radiologic misdiagnosis of polymicrogyria. However, the presence of other abnormalities in these cobblestone lissencephaly syndromes, including ocular anomalies, congenital muscular dystrophy, ventriculomegaly, and cerebellar dysplasia, usually distinguishes these disorders from polymicrogyria. There are no anatomopathologic studies that have characterized the pattern of cortical laminar alterations in patients with GPR56 gene mutations, but {{it has been suggested that}} the imaging characteristics of BFPP, including myelination defects and cerebellar cortical dysplasia, are reminiscent of those of the so-called cobblestone malformations (muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy) that are also associated with N-glycosylation defects in the developing brain.|$|E

40|$|Dystroglycanopathies are a {{clinically}} and genetically {{diverse group}} of recessively inherited conditions ranging from the most severe of the congenital muscular dystrophies, <b>Walker-Warburg</b> <b>syndrome,</b> to mild forms of adult-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Their hallmark is {{a reduction in the}} functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which can be detected in muscle biopsies. An important part of this glycosylation is a unique O-mannosylation, essential for the interaction of α-dystroglycan with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin-α 2. Mutations in eight genes coding for proteins in the glycosylation pathway are responsible for ∼ 50 % of dystroglycanopathy cases. Despite multiple efforts using traditional positional cloning, the causative genes for unsolved dystroglycanopathy cases have escaped discovery for several years. In a recent collaborative study, we discovered that loss-of-function recessive mutations in a novel gene, called isoprenoid synthase domain containing (ISPD), are a relatively common cause of <b>Walker-Warburg</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In this article, we report the involvement of the ISPD gene in milder dystroglycanopathy phenotypes ranging from congenital muscular dystrophy to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and identified allelic ISPD variants in nine cases belonging to seven families.

All MRI examinations were performed using a 1. 5 Tesla magnet without maternal sedation. RESULTS: MRI diagnosed 15 / 31 cases of Dandy-Walker Malformation, 6 / 31 cases of vermian partial caudal agenesis, 2 / 31 of vermian hypoplasia, 4 / 31 of vermian malrotation, 2 / 31 of <b>Walker-Warburg</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> 1 / 31 of Blake pouch cyst, 1 / 31 of rhombencephalosynapsis.

Retinal malformations {{are common in}} WWS; however, bilateral retinal detachment is a rare occurrence. We present {{a case of a}} newborn baby delivered at 36 + 3 weeks, who was the first living child of consanguineous parents of Turkish origin. On antenatal anomaly scans, the fetus had hydrocephalus that had increased throughout pregnancy, and a diagnosis of hydrancephaly was made at 36 weeks of gestation. Hypotonia, cleft lip and palate, poor suck and absent gag reflex were noted at birth. Ophthalmic examination at the age of 2 days revealed bilateral funnel retinal detachment. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed these findings, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed at the age of 13 days to establish a diagnosis. The MRI showed lissencephaly, hydrocephalus and thin rim of brain parenchyma, with a cobblestone appearance of the cortex and pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia, consistent with the diagnosis of WWS. The infant deteriorated and died at 39 days of age from complications associated with the brain anomalies. In summary, bilateral retinal detachment is extremely rare and in association with hydrocephalus and posterior fossa anomalies strongly suggests the diagnosis of WWS.

Bacterial IspD is a nucleotidyl transferase belonging to a large glycosyltransferase family, but the role of the orthologous protein in chordates is obscure to date, as this phylum does not have the corresponding non-mevalonate isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway.

40|$|Forward genetic screens {{represent}} powerful, unbiased {{approaches to}} uncover novel components in any biological process. Such screens {{suffer from a}} major bottleneck, however, namely the cloning of corresponding genes causing the phenotypic variation. Reverse genetic screens have been employed {{as a way to}} circumvent this issue, but can often be limited in scope. Here we demonstrate an innovative approach to gene discovery. Using C. elegans as a model system, we used a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation library, from the Million Mutation Project, together with the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT), to rapidly screen for and identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest, namely defects in dye-filling of ciliated sensory neurons. Such anomalies in dye-filling are often associated with the disruption of cilia, organelles which in humans are implicated in sensory physiology (including vision, smell and hearing), development and disease. Beyond identifying several well characterised dye-filling genes, our approach uncovered three genes not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function. From these putative novel dye-filling genes, we confirmed the involvement of BGNT- 1. 1 in ciliated sensory neuron function and morphogenesis. BGNT- 1. 1 functions at the trans-Golgi network of sheath cells (glia) to influence dye-filling and cilium length, in a cell non-autonomous manner. Notably, BGNT- 1. 1 is the orthologue of human B 3 GNT 1 /B 4 GAT 1, a glycosyltransferase associated with <b>Walker-Warburg</b> <b>syndrome</b> (WWS). WWS is a multigenic disorder characterised by muscular dystrophy as well as brain and eye anomalies.

40|$|Background: <b>Walker-Warburg</b> <b>syndrome</b> (WWS) is an {{autosomal}} recessive condition characterised by congenital muscular dystrophy, structural brain defects, and eye malformations. Typical brain abnormalities are hydrocephalus, lissencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, fusion of the hemispheres, cerebellar hypoplasia, and neuronal overmigration, which causes a cobblestone cortex. Ocular abnormalities include cataract, microphthalmia, buphthalmos, and Peters anomaly. WWS patients show defective O-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), which {{plays a key}} role in bridging the cytoskeleton of muscle and CNS cells with extracellular matrix proteins, important for muscle integrity and neuronal migration. In 20 % of the WWS patients, hypoglycosylation results from mutations in either the protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT 1), fukutin, or fukutin related protein (FKRP) genes.
