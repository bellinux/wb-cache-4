5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out.

25|$|A {{route from}} Seathwaite not {{designed}} for the ascent of Great Gable can be found by climbing up Styhead pass and then branching off into Mitchell Cove, following the beck almost to the summit. Aaron Slack can also be used. If starting from Ennerdale a long <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> valley can culminate in either a climb up Stone Cove to Windy Gap, or a slightly easier ascent of the Tongue to reach Gillercomb Head. Indirect climbs via Brandreth or Base Brown are also possible.|$|E
25|$|Under his leadership, the Rough Riders {{became famous}} for the charge up Kettle Hill on July 1, 1898, while {{supporting}} the regulars. Roosevelt had the only horse, and rode {{back and forth between}} rifle pits {{at the forefront of the}} advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged despite the absence of any orders from superiors. He was forced to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> last part of Kettle Hill, because his horse had been entangled in barbed wire. The victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1,000 wounded.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Ios is at {{the head}} of the Ormos harbor in the northwest. From there the bus or a 15-minute <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steep donkey path takes you to the village, known as Chora. Chora is a white and very picturesque cycladic village, full of stairs and narrow paths that make it {{inaccessible}} for cars of any kind. Today, the main path through this village is completely taken over by tourism in terms of restaurants, boutiques, bars and discothèques. Apart from the port and the village of Chora, Ios has only a few small settlements, just a group of spread out houses in the background of major beaches (Theodoti, Kalamos, Manganari). Since the 1990s, the island mayor Pousseos has worked on Ios' development towards attracting different types of tourists. With the help of European Community funds some roads have been built, all of them paved, and a scenic amphitheater has been created by the German architect Peter Haupt (who died in 2003) at the top of the village hill. Unfortunately, cultural events rarely take place up there.|$|E

25|$|Blue Panther Jr. was {{scheduled}} {{to compete in the}} third match of the night, an En Busca de un Ídolo match, but was replaced by Hechicero with the only explanation was that Blue Panther Jr. was not able to be at the show due to Force majeure. Delta won the match with less than a minute left on the clock, pinning Hechicero after a missed dive off the top rope. After the match on Delta stood before the judging panel for their feedback. Guest judge Diamante Azul gave Delta a 6 for his efforts, Hijo del Gladiador gave him a 6, Shocker 5 and finally El Titantes gave Delta a 6 for a total of 23 points.

500|$|Sera Utsé Hermitage (se ra dbu rtse ri khrod), meaning “Sera Peak” {{is located}} on the {{mountain}} directly behind Sera Monastery itself, which is about [...] north of the Jokhang, about a 1½-hour <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill from the main complex of Sera. It is reputedly older than Sera Gompa. According to tradition, the site contained one of Tsongkhapa’s (1357–1419) meditation huts and Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho (1641–1713) was reputed to have meditated here at end of the seventeenth or early eighteenth century. He was a distinguished meditator, who brought his knowledge of the philosophical tradition to Sera Utsé and attracted many students, amongst them included Phur lcog ngag dbang byams pa (1682–1762), and Mkhar rdo bzod pa rgya mtsho (1672–1749).|$|E
500|$|The <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Tor to the {{distinctive}} tower {{at the summit}} (the partially restored remains of an old church) is rewarded by vistas of the mid-Somerset area, including the Levels which are drained marshland. From there, on a dry point, [...] above sea level, {{it is easy to}} appreciate how Glastonbury was once an island and, in the winter, the surrounding moors are often flooded, giving that appearance once more. It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass, surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to the moors and Levels is by [...] "droves", i.e., green lanes. The Levels and inland moors can be [...] below peak tides and have large areas of peat. The low-lying areas are underlain by much older Triassic age formations of Upper Lias sand that protrude to form what would once have been islands and include Glastonbury Tor. The lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, following {{the end of the last}} ice age.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at two in the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E

500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E
