5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast {{that there would be}} a time jump in the episode. After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Robbins alive on the screen.

25|$|Malise is {{believed}} to have died in 1271, while in France. His body was brought back to Scotland, and he was buried at Dunblane Cathedral, the religious centre of Strathearn. In 1817, during reconstruction of Dunblane Cathedral, two sarcophagi were discovered with life-size effigies of a warrior and his lady. Since the fourteenth-century chronicler John of Fordun had recorded Dunblane as the burial site of Malise, these were determined to be the tombs of Malise and his countess, though which one is uncertain. It was marked with the date 1271. In addition, Sir Robert Sibbald once mentioned that in the late 17th century, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> in the church which represented the Countess of Strathearn and her children kneeling for a blessing to St. Blane, though its whereabouts today are unknown.|$|E

After finding plantation work difficult, they opened a bathhouse on River Street in Honolulu in 1928 and saved their money. The couple had a daughter, Sato Laura Chie, in 1924 and a son, Akira.

25|$|Barr easily {{turned back}} token {{opposition}} in the Republican primary and again received financial support from the National Republican Campaign Committee in his general election campaign. When Chandler decided not to attend the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Barr charged {{that he was trying}} to avoid association with President Barack Obama, who was seeking a second term but who was unpopular with many voters in Kentucky. A spokesperson for Chandler maintained that Chandler had previous engagements in his home district that week, but that he supported Obama's reelection. Barr was chosen to give a brief address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, during which he decried Obama's perceived hostility toward the coal industry. Chandler campaign staffers criticized Barr's decision to attend the convention, stating that he should spend the time in his district, getting to know the people there better. They also mocked the fact that the backdrop for Barr's speech <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the city of Louisville, which is not in the 6th district; Barr's campaign countered that they had no part in choosing the backdrop.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Cecilia Dribelle (Carol MacReady) - The extravagantly dressed businesswoman {{from whom}} Bodger rents his flat in Series 6 and 7. She has a {{distinct}} dislike for animals (apart from cats) and forbids her tenants from keeping pets, resulting in Bodger having to constantly hide Badger whenever she visits. She dislikes Bodger intensely and tries everything she can think of to evict him, she also expressed a dislike for pop music in one episode. She is fond of cakes and biscuits, and likes to make lots of money from silly ideas. She is nicknamed 'Mrs Dribble' and 'Dribbly Bibbly' by Badger. She drives around {{in a car with}} the registration plate 'DRIB 1' and has a cat called Fluffykins. In her early episodes she is made aware of Badger's presence by her sidekick, Elton, but never actually sees him as Elton's plans to catch Badger always fail. She eventually decides that Elton is imagining Badger. However, she has spotted Badger herself on several occasions - in one episode she saw Badger when she got knocked out, mistakenly thinking that Badger was her pet cat Fluffykins. Another was when Fluffykins had disappeared and Badger was inside the cat box pretending to be Fluffykins. Another time was when Badger was hiding behind a picture frame which Mrs Dribelle thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a Badger. After spending the majority of Series 6 trying to find ways to evict Bodger, Mrs Dribelle later employs him as her handyman in Series 7. Later on she allowed her niece, Vicky, to stay in the first floor flat above Bodger's after she evicted Alec Smart. After Vicky left to go touring with a band, Mrs Dribelle temporarily moved into the vacant flat while her house was being decorated.|$|E

500|$|There {{was in any}} case, as art {{historian}} Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, [...] "no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s". Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits, while her approach to her subject matter became [...] "more and more didactic". Women were frequently portrayed, both as rural workers (as in The Fair Musterer) and in domestic or family scenes (as in On The Hilltop). Several images, such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon, Knockalong portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting. Her most [...] "stereotypically feminine" [...] work was The Summer House, which shows two of Rix Nicholas's friends with some freshly cut flowers, in a setting that, unlike most of her works of the period, screened out the surrounding landscape. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed. Yet it {{has become one of}} her best known works, its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon-holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles.|$|E
