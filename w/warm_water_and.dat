The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E

Virgil was upgraded to a hurricane the next day; an eye formed an hour later. During the period of strengthening, Virgil turned more towards the north. Continued strengthening occurred, and it attained major hurricane status on September 2. At this time, the system was anticipated to make landfall in Mexico as a Category 4 hurricane. The storm had maximum winds of 130mph (215km/h), but shortly thereafter the storm began to weaken.|$|E
500|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{can produce}} extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, {{as well as}} high waves and damaging storm surge.

There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.|$|E

500|$|After {{intensification}} {{stopped on}} September 20 {{due to the}} eyewall cycle and slightly increased wind shear, Karl quickly restrengthened that evening over very <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> early on September 21 reached its peak intensity as a powerful Category4 hurricane with 145mph (230km/h) winds and a minimum central pressure of 938mbar. That morning, as Karl was moving northward, another eyewall replacement cycle began to take place and vertical shear increased, again weakening the storm temporarily. The trend continued into the evening, and the storm weakened to a Category2 hurricane by early on September 22. The weakening trend slowed down and eventually leveled off that afternoon with Karl remaining a Category2 hurricane as the storm turned towards the north-northeast. Late that evening, Karl began to restrengthen once again as wind shear diminished. The intensification continued into the morning of September 23, as Karl became a major hurricane a second time, reaching a final peak of 125mph (205km/h) winds. [...] Cooler waters and increased shear soon prevailed, however, and the storm quickly weakened, dropping to a Category1 hurricane by late that evening as the low-level circulation became detached from the mid-level circulation due to the strong southwesterly vertical wind shear.|$|E
500|$|Severe Cyclonic Storm Onil {{was first}} {{identified}} as an area of convection early on September30, 2004 situated roughly 465km (290mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. Satellite imagery depicted a poorly organized system with deep convection partially surrounding a low-level circulation. Situated over <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> within an area of moderate wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system's chances of developing into a tropical cyclone as [...] "fair". Within several hours of being identified, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring the system as Depression ARB 03. Despite a decrease in convection later on September30, the IMD upgraded the cyclone to a deep depression, stating that three-minute sustained winds had reached 55km/h (35mph). Early the next day, organization substantially improved, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Around 0900UTC on October1, the IMD upgraded the deep depression to Cyclonic Storm Onil. Upon being named, the storm became the first tropical cyclone on record to be named in the northern Indian Ocean. The WMO/ESCAP Panel agreed in May 2004 that in September, tropical cyclones in the Northern Indian Ocean attaining gale-force winds would be given names.|$|E
500|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{can produce}} extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, {{they are also}} able to produce high waves and a damaging storm surge.

This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from strong winds.

Workers would milk into a fine wire strainer placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a [...] "perceptible effect upon their milk". The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow. Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows. The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking.
