40|$|It is very {{important}} for a cable puller to grasp a wire rope tightly without any slippage and with no damage on both of the rope surface and cable gripper. The friction mechanism of a wire rope under a large deformation due to high grasp force, however, has not been sufficiently clarified. The present paper will report some results on friction of the wire rope under high compressive load on some cases such as under lubricated condition and under different contact conditions using three types of wire rope <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> <b>core,</b> fiber core and a galvanized rope with fiber core. As the results, the difference of contact area between the wire rope and gripper greatly affects the friction behavior; that is, the gripper with a curved surface can bring large friction force comparing with the gripper with a flat surface owing to its large real contact area, which is dominated by a restriction of the escape of wire between gripper surfaces and the deformation of a rope and a core...|$|E
40|$|Buckling {{restrained}} braces (BRBs) {{can develop}} axial yielding in compression {{in addition to}} axial yielding in tension, permitting an hysteretic behaviour of the BRB {{similar to that of}} its core material. As a result, BRBs <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> could be modelled using cyclic models already available for structural steel. However, commonly adopted available models do not address completely some highly desired requirements: description of significant isotropic hardening and non symmetric tension-compression response as observed experimentally, explicit computation of the plastic component of the deformation as required in BRB capacity models, smoothness of the transition from the elastic to the plastic range to improve convergence rate, limited number of input data parameters to facilitate its implementation and use. In this paper an elastoplastic constitutive model for steel BRBs is presented following a simple and consistent approach based on a rheological scheme that requires the use of only one internal variable. The adopted formulation allows a straightforward interpretation and identification of its constitutive properties as well as the explicit computation of response quantities related to failure and dissipated energy.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforcing bars for concrete structure has been extensively investigated {{and a number of}} FRP bars are commercially available. However, major shortcomings of the existing FRP bars are its high initial cost and low elastic modulus compared to conventional steel bars. The main objective of this study using the concept of material hybridization is to develop a viable hybrid FRP bar for concrete structures, especially for marine and waterfront concrete structures. The purposes of hybridization are to increase the elastic modulus of GFRP bar which have function of protecting corrosion and to reduce the initial cost of the FRP bar. Two types of hybrid FRP bar were considered in the development: GFRP crust <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> and GFRP bar with steel wires dispersed over the cross-section. Using E-glass fibers and unsaturated polyester resins, the hybrid GFRP bar samples of 13 mm in diameter were pultruded and tested for tensile strength. The effect of hybridization on tensile properties of FRP bars were obtained by comparing the results of tensile test with those of non-hybrid GFRP bars. The results of this study indicated that the elastic modulus of the hybrid FRP bar was increased by up to 160 percent compare to non-hybrid GFRP bars. The results of the test program and the future recommendations are summarized in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{buckling}} restrained braces (BRBs) {{is gaining}} popularity both for new construction and rehabilitation projects in seismic areas {{due to their}} large and stable energy dissipation. As buckling is prevented, {{the core of the}} BRB can develop axial yielding in compression in addition to axial yielding in tension, permitting an hysteretic behaviour of the BRB {{similar to that of the}} material of the core. As a result, BRBs <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> could be modelled using cyclic models already available and commonly used in the literature for structural steel. However available models do not address completely some highly desired requirements: appropriate isotropic hardening that has an important role in BRB behaviour, non symmetric tension-compression response as observed experimentally, explicit computation of the plastic component of the deformation as required in BRB capacity models, smoothness of the elastic-plastic transition, simple implementation and limited number of input data parameters to facilitate its implementation and use. Therefore, a cyclic elastoplastic model for steel BRBs is presented following a simple and consistent approach based on a rheological scheme that requires the use of only one internal variable. The formulation adopted allows a straightforward interpretation and identification of the constitutive properties of the model as well as the explicit computation of response quantities related to failure and dissipated energy. Specific BRB behavioural aspects are addresses with an appropriate isotropic hardening rule as well as non symmetric tension-compression response. Response results obtained using the proposed model are discussed and compared to various experimental test results available in the literature, showing an easy identification of the constitutive parameters required and accurate predictions of the BRBs experimental response...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a development case of robotic machine for {{the dismantling of}} steel-concrete structures using diamond wire technology. The {{focus is on the}} application of the so called soft-wire with core made of superelastic alloy in place of the steel rope traditionally used. Remote-controlled machinery operating in risky areas must be the simplest possible for reliability and to shorten the development time as generally these machines are tailored to the task. In the case of dismantling of nuclear equipment there are two additional reasons to prefer simple designs: The need to decommission the cutting machinery together with the nuclear wastes and the limit to the use of electronics onboard due to radiation. With steel-cored cutting wires an active tensioner is needed to compensate for tension shocks occurring during cutting. This is the most complex component of the cutting system and it requires a control system with actuation and some electronics. A significant benefit comes from the removal of the active tensioner. The current direction is the use of soft wires in place of the ones <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> <b>core.</b> The steel rope is replaced by a core wire made of superelastic alloy. The tension of the wire is an independent cutting parameter. The selection of the core wire architecture and diameter, the point along the stress-strain curve where the wire superelastic alloy is in nominal conditions and the use of stress-strain plafond in the curve are critical. The paper discusses first the principles of cutting with soft wire. Then the design of the cutting system is addressed and the requirements of robotized cutting machinery is discusses. Different simulation schemes and approaches are proposed to model cutting forces and system dynamics. In a multibody model with the wire treated as a discontinuous flexible winded along a system of pulleys. The data from the multibody analysis is used in the Finite elements to characterize the static and dynamic response of Pseudo-elastic wire segment between the two diamond beads...|$|E

40|$|First, {{we present}} two offline {{position}} verification methods {{which can be}} used in radiotherapy for detecting the position of the bony anatomy of a patient automatically with portal imaging, even if every single portal image of each segment of an (IMRT) treatment beam contains insufficient matching information. Additional position verification fields will no longer be necessary, which speeds up the treatment and reduces the total dose to the patient. Second, a tool is described which enhances the way tumors can be delineated by using multiple imaging modalities. This tool is especially useful when multiple MRI sequences are available as well as the standard planning CT. We also developed a marker which is visible on MRI and on EPID. A separate CT for detecting the markers is no longer needed. The gold marker <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> can be detected on various MRI sequences, reducing the overall systematic radiotherapy treatment error. The MRI linear accelerator (MRL) facilitates continuous patient anatomy updates regarding translations, rotations and deformations of targets and OAR during a course of radiotherapy. Accounting for this information demands high speed, online IMRT re-optimization. Therefore, we developed a fast IMRT optimization system which combines a GPU based Monte-Carlo dose calculation engine for online beamlet generation (GPUMCD) and a fast inverse dose optimization algorithm (FIDO). We show that for the presented cases the beamlets generation and optimization routines are fast enough for online IMRT planning. Furthermore, there is no influence of the magnetic field on plan quality and complexity, and equal optimization constraints at 0 T and 1. 5 T lead to almost identical dose distributions. One of the most significant effects of the transverse magnetic field on the dose distribution occur around air cavities: the electron return effect (ERE). We investigated the effects of non-stationary spherical air cavities on IMRT dose delivery in 0. 35 T and 1. 5 T transverse magnetic fields by using Monte Carlo simulations. Our observations show the intrinsic ERE compensation by equidistant and opposing beam configurations for moving spherical air cavities within the target area. IMRT gives some additional compensation, but only in the case of correct positioning of the air cavity according to the IMRT compensation. For air cavities appearing or disappearing during a fraction this correct positioning is absent and gating or plan re-optimization should be used. Finally, we introduce an online 'virtual couch shift' (VCS) : we translate and/or rotate the pre-treatment dose distribution to compensate for the changes in patient anatomy and generate a new plan which delivers the transformed dose distribution automatically. The VCS is the first step towards compensating all anatomical changes (translation, rotations, and deformations) by online re-optimization of the IMRT dose distribution...|$|E
