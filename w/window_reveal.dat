5000|$|The Series 62 {{included}} a lower sleeker body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets {{were incorporated into}} the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An Eldorado style wraparound windshield was seen on all models. Sedans used a distinctive style of <b>window</b> <b>reveal</b> molding, which created a built in sun visor effect. For coupes a smoothly curved wraparound backlight {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Florentine" [...] style rear window. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield on all body styles and the chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. The Series 62 could be distinguished by the lack of rear fender louvers. V-shaped ornaments and crests were used in the hood and deck and there were full length body underscores in bright metal. Coupe de Ville script was seen on rear corner pillars of the luxury hardtop, which also had wider sill moldings. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear body sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupe built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Automatic windshield washers, power steering, 12-Volt electrical system, and aluminum alloy pistons made the long list of standard equipment {{for the first time this}} year. Power steering, windows, seats, and auto headlight dimming were optional. [...] A parking brake release reminder light was new. Popular Mechanics rated to 0-60 mph time as 17.3 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Femtosecond {{fluorescence}} upconversion {{experiments were}} performed on the naturally occurring medicinal pigment, curcumin, in anionic, cationic, and neutral micelles. In our studies, the micelles are composed of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB), and triton X- 100 (TX- 100). We demonstrate that the excited-state kinetics of curcumin in micelles have a fast (3 − 8 ps) and slow (50 − 80 ps) component. While deuteration of curcumin has a negligible effect on the fast component, the slow component exhibits a pronounced isotope effect of ∼ 1. 6, indicating that micelle-captured curcumin undergoes excited-state intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer. Studies of solvation dynamics of curcumin in a 10 ps time <b>window</b> <b>reveal</b> a fast component (≤ 300 fs) followed by a 8, 6, and 3 ps component in the solvation correlation function for the TX- 100, DTAB, and SDS micelles, respectively...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that non-normality plays an {{important}} role in asset and risk management. However, handling a large number of assets has long been a challenge. In this paper, we present a statistical technique that extends Principal Component Analysis to higher moments such as skewness and kurtosis. This method allows us to identify factors that drive the co-skewness and co-kurtosis across assets. These factors have interesting interpretations, for instance as hedges against increases in volatility among certain assets. We illustrate this approach using 37 international stock indices sampled at weekly frequency, for a total of 763 observations. We assert that both the co-skewness and co-kurtosis structures can be summarized with a small number of factors. This method is both fast and able to handle large portfolios under non-normality.

40|$|The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} SZE surveys will shed fresh light onto {{the study of}} clusters. What will this new observational <b>window</b> <b>reveal</b> about cluster properties? What can we learn from combining X-ray, SZE, and optical observations? How do variations in the gas entropy profile, dark matter concentration, accretion pressure, and bound baryon fraction affect SZE observables? We investigate the signature of these important cluster parameters with an analytic model of the intracluster medium (ICM). Given the current uncertainties in ICM physics, our approach is to span the range of plausible models motivated by observations and a small set of assumptions. We find a tight relation between the central Compton parameter and the X-ray luminosity outside the cluster core, suggesting that these observables carry the same information about the ICM. The total SZE luminosity {{is proportional to the}} thermal energy of the gas, and is a surprisingly robust indicator of cluster mass: L_SZ∝ f_b M^ 5 / 3. We show that a combination of L_SZ and the half-luminosity radius r_SZ provides a measure of the potential energy of the cluster gas, and thus we can deduce the total energy content of the bound ICM. We caution that any systematic variation of the baryon fraction will distort the expected L_SZ - M calibration to be used to study the evolution of cluster number density...|$|E
40|$|Halpha and Hbeta {{spectroscopy}} {{with the}} Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) reveals a strong concentration of high velocity emission in a 5 by 5 deg area centered near (l. b) = (27,- 3), {{known as the}} Scutum Cloud. The high velocities imply that we are detecting optical emission from near {{the plane of the}} Galaxy out to the tangent point at heliocentric distances of D ≳ 6 kpc, assuming the gas participates in circular Galactic rotation. The ratio of the Halpha to Hbeta emission as a function of velocity suggests that dust along these lines of sight produces a total visual extinction of A_v 3 at D 6 kpc. This makes it possible to use optical emission lines to explore the physical conditions of ionized gas in the inner Galaxy. At a Galactocentric distance R_G 4 kpc, for example, we find that the H^+ has an rms midplane density of 1 cm^- 3 with a vertical scale height of 300 pc. We also find evidence for an increase in the flux of Lyman continuum photons and an increase in the ratio of ionized to neutral hydrogen toward the inner Galaxy. We have extended the measurements of E(B-V) in this direction to distances far beyond what has been accessible through stellar photometry and find E(B-V) /N_H to be near the local mean of 1. 7 x 10 ^- 22 cm^ 2 mag, with evidence for an increase in this ratio at R_G 4 kpc. Finally, our observations of [NII] 6583, [SII] 6716, and [OIII] 5007 toward the <b>window</b> <b>reveal</b> that in the inner Galaxy the temperature of the gas and the ionization state of oxygen increase with increasing height from the midplane.

40|$|We {{present the}} nowcast model for low‐energy (< 200 keV) {{electrons}} {{in the inner}} magnetosphere, which is the version of the Inner Magnetosphere Particle Transport and Acceleration Model (IMPTAM) for electrons. Low‐energy electron fluxes {{are very important to}} specify when hazardous satellite surface‐charging phenomena are considered. The presented model provides the low‐energy electron flux at all L shells and at all satellite orbits, when necessary. The model is driven by the real‐time solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) parameters with 1 h time shift for propagation to the Earth's magnetopause and by the real time Dst index. Real‐time geostationary GOES 13 or GOES 15 (whenever each is available) data on electron fluxes in three energies, such as 40 keV, 75 keV, and 150 keV, are used for comparison and validation of IMPTAM running online. On average, the model provides quite reasonable agreement with the data; the basic level of the observed fluxes is reproduced. The best agreement between the modeled and the observed fluxes are found for < 100 keV electrons. At the same time, not all the peaks and dropouts in the observed electron fluxes are reproduced. For 150 keV electrons, the modeled fluxes are often smaller than the observed ones by an order of magnitude. The normalized root‐mean‐square deviation is found to range from 0. 015 to 0. 0324. Though these metrics are buoyed by large standard deviations, owing to the dynamic nature of the fluxes, they demonstrate that IMPTAM, on average, predicts the observed fluxes satisfactorily. The computed binary event tables for predicting high flux values within each 1 h <b>window</b> <b>reveal</b> reasonable hit rates being 0. 660 – 0. 318 for flux thresholds of 5 · 104 – 2 · 105 cm− 2 s− 1 sr− 1 keV− 1 for 40 keV electrons, 0. 739 – 0. 367 for flux thresholds of 3 · 104 – 1 · 105 cm− 2 s− 1 sr− 1 keV− 1 for 75 keV electrons, and 0. 485 – 0. 438 for flux thresholds of 3 · 103 – 3. 5 · 103 cm− 2 s− 1 sr− 1 keV− 1 for 150 keV electrons but rather small Heidke Skill Scores (0. 17 and below). This is the first attempt to model low‐energy electrons in real time at 10 min resolution. The output of this model can serve as an input of electron seed population for real‐time higher‐energy radiation belt modeling.
