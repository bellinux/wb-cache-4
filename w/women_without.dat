5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left <b>women</b> <b>without</b> a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more {{in the way of}} education without a real way to use it.|$|E
5|$|The {{article was}} {{published}} {{during a period}} of intense public debate. Freedom of press had been established in 1766 and encouraged people to give their suggestions on how to improve Swedish society. Economy, emigration, agriculture and education were hotly debated issues, as well as the problematic situation for unmarried middle class <b>women.</b> <b>Without</b> a spouse a woman in 18th century Sweden could have great difficulty supporting herself, especially as lower ranking servants were often promoted to maids and thereby lowering the number of employment opportunities for unmarried women.|$|E
5|$|The main {{benefit of}} breast {{brachytherapy}} compared to whole breast irradiation {{is that a}} high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs. APBI can typically be completed {{over the course of}} a week. The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or <b>women</b> <b>without</b> easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Xperiment came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 {{the deal with}} Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company {{produced}} just one feature film that year, <b>Women</b> <b>Without</b> Men. Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling {{in the face of}} competition from television and faced closure. The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists. From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert. This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married <b>women</b> <b>without</b> their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E

25|$|Levonorgestrel intrauterine {{devices are}} {{effective}} in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms.
