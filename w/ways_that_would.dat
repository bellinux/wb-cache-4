He taught musicians irrespective of their instrument and structured lessons to meet the needs of each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow them to find and express their own musical feelings, or style.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper {{to include a}} proof of the continuum hypothesis, but {{had to settle for}} expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, EastEnders {{producers}} {{decided to}} reintroduce {{the character of}} Sam Mitchell. Although they initially considered recasting the role to another actress, and despite all her past problems, they decided to give Danniella another chance and she was asked back for a third time. During her time away, Danniella's excessive use of cocaine had completely eroded away her nasal septum. To hide this from the audience, Danniella was only filmed in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> keep her septum hidden from view. However, Danniella's drug taking continued and in 2000, {{she was asked to}} leave EastEnders again. In 2001, the character of Sam Mitchell was reintroduced again, but due to Danniella's continuing problems, producers decided to recast. Kim Medcalf became the second actress to play Sam Mitchell, appearing from 29 January 2002 until 17 November 2005.|$|E

To accomplish this feat, several plot devices were used to increase Lonnie's abilities.

[...] A second front organization, The Anarkist Foundation, was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports. A Biofeedback Learning Enhancer was employed to increase Lonnie's abilities. The cybernetic device was described as being capable of amplifying brain functions by a multiple of ten. Anarky was also described as having begun to train in martial arts, following the character's time in juvenile hall.|$|E

500|$|Fielding uses Luckless and The Author's Farce {{to portray}} {{aspects of his}} life, {{including}} his experience with the London theatre community. The plot serves as revenge for the Theatre Royal's rejection of Fielding's earlier plays. However, this and his being forced into minor theatres proved beneficial, because it allowed him more freedom to experiment with his plays in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been unacceptable at larger locations. This experimentation, beginning with The Author's Farce, is an attempt by Fielding to try writing in formats beyond the standard five-act comedy play. Though he returned to writing five-act plays later, many of his plays contain plot structures that differ from those common to contemporary plays. To distinguish his satirical intent, Fielding claims that the work was written by [...] "Scriblerus Secundus," [...] which places his play within an earlier literary tradition. The name refers to the Scriblerus Club, a satirical group whose members included Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot. Fielding's use of the pseudonym connects his play to the satirical writings of the Scriblerus Club's members, and reveals their influence on his new style, such as incorporating in their work the styles of the entertainments that they were ridiculing. Fielding thus allows the audience {{to believe that he}} is poking fun at others, less discriminating than themselves, and less able to distinguish good art from bad. Fielding also borrowed characters from the work of the Club's members, such as the Goddess of Nonsense, influenced by Pope's character from The Dunciad, Dulness, who is at war with reason. Nonsense, like Dulness, is a force that promotes the corruption of literature and taste, to which Fielding adds a sexual element. This sexuality is complicated, yet also made comical, when Nonsense chooses a castrated man as her mate. Her choice emphasises a lack of morality, {{one of the problems that}} Fielding believed dominated 18th-century British society. Despite the link to Dulness, the general satire of the play more closely resembles Gay's Beggar's Opera than the other works produced by the Scriblerus Club.|$|E
500|$|The {{per capita}} iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, and by 1078 Song China was {{producing}} [...] in weight of iron per year. [...] The historian Donald B. Wagner {{points out that}} this estimate was based upon {{the total number of}} government tax receipts on iron from the various iron-producing prefectures in the empire. In the smelting process of using huge bellows driven by hydraulics (i.e. large waterwheels), massive amounts of charcoal were used in the production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land and prime timber in northern China were spared by the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources to coal. This massive increase in output of the iron and steel industry in China was the result of the Song dynasty's needs for military expansion, private commercial demands for metal products such as cooking utensils found in the market and a wide variety of agricultural tools, and by new canals linking major centers of iron and steel production to the capital city's bustling market. The many uses for manufactured iron products in the Song period included iron for weapons, implements, coins, architectural elements, musical bells, artistic statues, and components for machinery such as the hydraulic-powered trip hammer, which had been known since the 1st century BCE during the ancient Han dynasty, and used extensively during the Song. Due to the enormous amount of production, the economic historian Robert Hartwell noted that Chinese iron and coal production in the following 12th century was equal to if not greater than England's iron and coal production in the early phase of the Industrial Revolution during the late 18th century. However, the Chinese of the Song period did not harness the energy potential of coal in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> generate power mechanically, as in the later Industrial Revolution that would originate in the West. There were certain administrative prefectures during the Song era where the Chinese iron industry was mostly concentrated. For example, the poet and statesman Su Shi wrote a memorial to the throne in 1078 that specified 36 ironwork smelters, each employing a work force of several hundred people, in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture (under his governance while he administered Xuzhou).|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{provides}} {{all of her}} character's vocals {{for both}} the film and its soundtrack. Because she does not consider herself a professional singer, Pfeiffer's inhibitions about singing on camera initially contributed to her early reservations about accepting the role, having not done so since her performance in Grease 2; The Fabulous Baker Boys would mark Pfeiffer's first professional singing role in seven years. Despite Kloves' insistence that Pfeiffer's singing voice not be dubbed, composer Dave Grusin was initially skeptical about Pfeiffer's musical abilities until she ultimately convinced him with her rendition of [...] "My Funny Valentine". For four months (although sources differ, citing any period of time between two months to an entire year), the actress took extensive singing lessons {{under the tutelage of}} voice coach Sally Stevens in preparation for the role, at the suggestion of Grusin. In addition to performing vocal exercises to strengthen her vocal chords, Pfeiffer would often work 10-hour days in the recording studio before finally returning home to listen to and study her own recordings. Already impressed with Pfeiffer's rhythm and phrasing, Stevens trained the actress to avoid pronouncing words in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make the film's jazz standards sound too much like rock songs; Stevens jokenly linkened Pfeiffer's original pronunciation to musician Bob Dylan, and recording the songs for Pfieffer to use as reference for enunciation, teaching the actress about using her teeth and mouth to pronounce words and smiling to [...] "lift" [...] her pitch. Admitting that the film's songs were much more difficult than the ones she had performed in Grease 2, Pfeiffer worked especially hard on improving her phrasing because the material for The Fabulous Baker Boys were different than the pop music she had grown more accustomed to singing, explaining, [...] "Those older songs were written for singers; they weren't written for synthesizers and drums... It was an entirely new way of listening to songs." [...] Additionally, the actress drew inspiration from real-life lounge singers performing at The Hollyood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, while listening to jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Rickie Lee Jones, Billie Holiday and Helen Merrill for inspiration, maintaining, [...] "I didn't copy anybody, but I heard a lot. For me, it helps to act the song out." [...] Pfeiffer incorporated the [...] "undercurrent of anger" [...] in the lounge singer's performances, drawn from the fact that [...] "a lot of club singers... haven't had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for" [...] into her own interpretation of Susie. Stevens encouraged Pfeiffer to envision herself as Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in the film Casablanca (1942) while recording [...] "More Than You Know" [...] for the film's soundtrack, which the actress identified as one of her favorite songs. Stevens also suggested that Pfeiffer research jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald because Fitzgerald possesses [...] "a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character Susie might have listened to", describing the end result as [...] "an airy alto, a nice breathy quality, and intelligence in delivery". Despite her extensive training, the vocal coach felt it was important that Susie's voice sound [...] "pleasant" [...] but still untrained. Kloves maintains that he did not hire Pfeiffer based on her singing abilities, but rather because {{of the way in which}} she uses her acting abilities to interpret lyrics.|$|E
