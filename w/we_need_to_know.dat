To figure out the distance of the landmark from the ship's position in the morning (C) is a matter of treating the distance BC as the calculated ritorno. Since <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the alargar to calculate the ritorno, this is a two-step procedure.|$|E

If a small addition of x, equal to ∆x, results in increasing y by ∆y, so that y = f(x) becomes y + ∆y = f(x+∆x), the value of dy/dx = 2x is f(x) = x² (proven after simplifying to y + ∆y), which means that a small a addition of x, ∆x, has reduced dy/dx.|$|E
25|$|Having {{established}} that the sources of natural variation are mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, Dobzhansky considers what shapes and preserves this variation. In {{the first edition of}} this book, he considers genetic drift as important as natural selection. As an example, he argued that drift was the reason for racial variations that were observed in Partula, a land snail, so these variations had no adaptive advantage. He argued that most such variations, which he called microgeographic race, was nonadaptive. Because variation is not always controlled by selection, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the size of a population before we can predict its evolutionary dynamics.|$|E

500|$|One {{negative}} {{review was}} written by Margaret McFadden-Gerber in Magill's Literary Annual, who found the book disappointing and felt that it lacked the power and introspection of Angelou's previous books. At least one reviewer expresses disappointment that Angelou did not use her status to effect any political change in Singin' and Swingin'. Critic Lyman B. Hagen responds to this criticism by stating that Angelou's status during the events she describes in this autobiography did not lend itself {{to that kind of}} advocacy, and that as a person, Angelou had not evolved into the advocate that she would become later in her life. Reviewer John McWhorter finds many of the events Angelou describes throughout all of her autobiographies incoherent and confusing, and in need of further explanation as to her motives and reasons for her behavior. For example, McWhorter suggests that Angelou does a poor job of explaining her reasons for her marriage to Tosh Angelos, as well as their divorce. [...] "In an autobiography in which a black woman marries outside of her race in the 1950s, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more".|$|E

[...] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: [...] "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying." [...] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of [...] "D", noting that [...] "Wolverine was the lead character of [...] films, and we've already learned everything <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> from the films in said franchise," [...] adding that [...] "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting."
