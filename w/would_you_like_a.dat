500|$|Bruce Campbell, {{a long-time}} {{colleague}} of director Sam Raimi, has a cameo as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in. Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, {{who worked on}} the storyboards for the cancelled Spider-Man 4 movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio. Ted Raimi, Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant [...] "Hoffman". Sam Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Peter as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, in which he asks Peter, [...] "Hey kid, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pair of these glasses? They're the kind they wore in X-Men." [...] The scene was cut, and Lee only briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin in Times Square. R/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself. One of the stunt performers in the film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen. Robert Kerman, best known for his performances in pornographic and exploitation films, has a bit part as a tugboat captain. Lucy Lawless makes a cameo as a punk rock girl. It was also intended for Hugh Jackman to make an appearance in the film as Logan / Wolverine, reprising the role from 2000's X-Men, but a dispute between Sony and 20th Century Fox over the characters' film rights prevented it from happening. The novelization of Spider-Man identifies Liz Allan as the character portrayed by Sally Livingstone.|$|E
