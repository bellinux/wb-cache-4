Unequal sharing of parental transfers is, for example, a necessary condition for theories of altruistic (dynastic) behavior to hold. I use a new data set based on the estate reports for 230 <b>widows,</b> <b>widowers,</b> and divorcees from the city of Stockholm, Sweden deceased in 2004. Unequal sharing is unusual, depending on definitions only 7 – 25 percent of the estates are unequally divided. The data set is also used to estimate probit models for the likelihood of unequal sharing. A first main result is that the probability of unequal sharing is increasing in the size of the estate. Second, the older the children are on average the more likely is unequal sharing. Finally, unequal sharing is more common among deceased from some neighborhoods of the city compared to deceased from other neighborhoods. bequests; inheritances; equal division; altruism...|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined In nineteenth-century Europe, the {{foundling}} hospital grew {{beyond its}} traditional purpose of mitigating {{the shame of}} unwed mothers by also permitting <b>widows,</b> <b>widowers,</b> and poor married couples to abandon their children there temporarily. In the Foundling Hospital of Madrid (fhm), this new short-term abandonment could be completely anonymous due {{to the implementation of}} a wheel—a device on the outside wall of the institution that could be turned to place a child inside—which remained open until 1929. The use of survival-analysis techniques to disentangle the determinants of retrieval in a discrete framework reveals important differences in the situations of the women who abandoned their children at the fhm, partly depending on whether they accessed it through the Maternity Hospital after giving birth or they accessed it directly. The evidence suggests that those who abandoned their children through the Maternity Hospital retrieved them only when they had attained a certain degree of economic stability, whereas those who abandoned otherwise did so just as soon as the immediate condition prompting the abandonment had improved...|$|E
40|$|Mutual {{funds have}} enjoyed phenomenal growth with their numbers {{exceeding}} {{the number of}} public companies and their assets aggregating in excess of 9 trillion.

This paper examines from a behavioral perspective how regulation can best disclose information related to two key factors for investors to compare competing mutual funds: fund returns and fund expenses. Our analysis reflects that the current disclosure process is deficient because it fails to reflect the insights of research on judgment and decision making, and particularly the need to distinguish between the availability of information and its processability by its user. The message of our article is straightforward: if regulators adhered to the insights provided by our paper, not only investors, but also the fund 2 ̆ 7 s directors, would be greatly empowered so that better returns and lower costs could be expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this essay is to study to what extent parents divide their estates unequally between their children and the determinants of this decision. We use a new dataset based on the estate reports for almost 70, 000 Swedish <b>widows,</b> <b>widowers,</b> divorcees and unmarried individuals who died with positive estates {{and at least two}} children. Unequal sharing is unusual; depending on definitions only 2 – 12 percent of the estates are unequally divided. Previous studies for other countries, particularly from the US, find that around 20 – 40 percent of parents divide their estates unequally. We argue that the relatively low frequency of unequal sharing in Sweden might be explained by contextual factors such as the inheritance law, the transfer tax system, the income distribution, and the welfare state. We also estimate models with family fixed effects to study how the characteristics of children to parents who choose unequal division affect the size of the transfer. The empirical estimates show that bequests are not used to compensate for income differences between children, suggesting that bequests are not guided by altruistic motives. Children who are likely to have provided services to the parent receive more than their siblings however. This suggests that, at least some bequests are guided by exchange motives.

40|$|Approach of {{tapping into}} {{religion}} rekindles debate on nexus {{of religion and}} poverty. Plucking from social capital theory, this paper argues that ordered church membership is providing solace for {{a vast majority of}} older people; barely surviving due to volatile family support. Religious organisations are not only a means of escape from poverty but provide an existentialist function to life - ward off isolation, marginalisation, building strong sense of social and community justice. Using empirical data, this paper engages with faith approaches that act as buffer intermingled with local realities. Mainstream churches set aside designated days in church calendar for collection of alms to cater for <b>widows,</b> <b>widowers,</b> orphans, whilst with Muslim faithful, they pool donations (cash, food, other provisions) as a means of looking after disadvantaged Muslims. Though offerings remain insignificant, funds sourced engender a spirit of compassion and psychological support for deprived followers. Islam projects basic principles as spelled out in the Koran through internal mechanisms of voluntary endowment (zakat/sadaqa) to cater for its vulnerable populations. With little in way of resources, denominations are devising safeguards to cushion pain during troubling times whilst sharing good times in fellowship. Schemes include funeral arrangements, bereavement visits and support with hospitalisation costs; social events like births, marriages and entrepreneurial activities based on token contributions from members. Focusing on Christian Women‘s Fellowship(CWF), this study underscores the centrality of faith based groups as safety nets. It concludes that Christianity and Islam go beyond ethos and vortex of spirituality, as entrenched groups wrestle to provide for many trapped in poverty. With sporadic funding from charitable organizations and churches overseas, provided directly or indirectly, religious organizations are battling with an existentialist agenda...|$|E

Using the case study design, the study investigated the spread and prevention of HIV/AIDS, strategies in educating and raising awareness and examining the hardships of day to day livelihood of people living with HIV/AIDS in Levolosi ward within Arusha Municipality. HIV/AIDS is a deadly disease with no cure nor medicine. The disease, is a community based, on social, cultural and economic problem. HIV/AIDS is a national problem and indeed a threat to community development. HIV/AIDS {{is the leading cause of}} death for economically active segment of the population. Arusha Municipal Council reported its first AIDS patient in 1986 and since then the number of cases has been increasing steadily and for the year 2002 only, the Municipality reported 354 new cases, with a prevalence rate of 17 - 19 %. For 2004 [Jan. - June] the Council reported 224 cases with a prevalence rate of 21 %. Levolosi ward alone carried 10. 7 %.

40|$|Estudo, do tipo descritivo, guiado por princípios etnográficos, que objetivaram analisar o idoso no contexto familiar, em seu processo de saúde e envelhecimento, no bairro de Felipe Camarão, localizado na região administrativa Oeste do município de Natal/RN, cidade do Nordeste do Brasil. Os participantes do estudo são idosos com idades entre 61 e 84 anos, residentes nesse bairro, cuja maioria, é constituída por migrantes da região rural do Estado, aposentados, incluindo viúvos e casados, com baixa escolaridade. Para a coleta das informações, utilizou-se a entrevista semi-estruturada, a observação participante e o diário de campo, efetivando-se, na sua maioria, nos domicílios e na Unidade de Saúde da Família, no período de março a outubro de 2006. Para a discussão dos resultados, utilizou-se a análise de conteúdo temática e o programa ALCESTE (Análise Léxica por Contexto de um Conjunto de Segmentos de Texto), através do qual emergiram dois corpus: o corpus I: Família e os idosos, e o corpus II, O idoso e a velhice na sociedade. A análise dos resultados permitiu concluir que a família, também utilizada pelas políticas públicas, como estratégia das suas práticas em saúde, é um suporte de apoio necessário para o cidadão idoso em seu processo de envelhecimento e de saúde. Os contextos familiares dos idosos permitiram identificar a existência de condições sociais mínimas de vida, e de novos re-arranjos das famílias atuais, através da convivência plurigeracional e da presença atuante da mulher idosa, como mantenedora dessa família; das relações de conflitos entre seus membros, num nível suportável de convivência. Diferentes concepções sobre a velhice e a pessoa idosa, originam desencontros e divergências, contudo, o apoio e a ajuda para resolução dos problemas e a atenção à saúde são provenientes dos familiares. Porém, nota-se que a solidão é algo presente no cotidiano desses idosos. Sobre a atenção à saúde, em nível de atenção básica, percebe-se haver ainda várias lacunas, principalmente no tocante às ações de promoção e prevenção, merecendo maior sensibilização e empenho por parte das instituições locais de saúdeStudy, a descriptive-like one, {{is guided}} by ethnographic {{principles}} which have analyzed the elderly within the familiar context in his/her process of health and aging, in the neighborhood called Felipe Camarão, located in the western administrative region of Natal, RN, a Northeastern city of Brazil. The participants are elders aging 61 to 84 years old, living in this referring neighborhood, whose majority is constituted of migrants from the rural region {{of the state of}} the RN, retired, including <b>widows,</b> <b>widowers</b> and married couples, with low school-educational degree. For the information gathering it was utilized a semi-structured interview, the participant observation and the field diary, being put into effect, in majority, in the houses and in the Family Health Unit, in a period between March and October of 2006. For the results discussion it was utilized an analysis of thematic content and the program ALCESTE (In Portuguese, Análise Léxica por Contexto de um Conjunto de Segmentos de Texto or Lexical Analysis by Context of a Set of Text Segments), which through have emerged two corpus: the corpus I, Family and the elderly, and corpus II, The elderly and the aging within society. The analysis of the results has permitted to conclude that the family, also used by the public policies as a strategy of their practices in health, it is a necessary base support for the elderly citizen in his/her process of aging and of health. The elders familiar contexts have allowed this study to identify the existence of minimal social conditions of life, of new rearrangements of the current families by means of the plurigenerational acquaintanceship and the active presence of the elderly woman as a maintainer of this family; also by means of conflicted relationships among one another but in a bearable level of acquaintanceship. Different conceptions about the aging and the elderly generate disagreement and divergency however the family support and help for the solving of these problems and the attention to health are proceeding from the family components. However, it is noticed that loneliness is something present in these elder s everyday lives. About the attention to health, in a basic level of it, it was noticed that there are still a lot of gaps, mainly concerning promotional and preventing actions, deserving a higher sensitization and effort by the local health institution...|$|E
