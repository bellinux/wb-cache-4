5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> to base {{the changes to}} the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E

It was a power and privilege that he enjoyed, although he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> not to flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.|$|E

500|$|Previously, {{leadership}} of the 261st Battalion alternated between Hoang, a South Vietnamese revolutionary who had returned from North Vietnam after 1954, and Tu Khue, who {{was a native of}} North Vietnam. Khue was unpopular among the battalion's soldiers because he was known to be very strict and demanding. However, he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> about details. In contrast, Hoang was far more relaxed and commanded a high degree of confidence from the soldiers of the 261st Battalion. Thus, due to his strong leadership skills and popularity, Hoang was selected to take command of Viet Cong forces for operations in Ap Bac. Most of the soldiers under Hoang's command were equipped with captured US weaponry, such as the M1 carbine, BAR light machine guns, [...]30 caliber machine guns, and a single 60mm mortar.|$|E

Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939, Pope Pius XII, in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his {{election}} to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the [...] "most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments". His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: [...] "Pius XII <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> not to close any doors (to science) prematurely.

Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be a}} sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl.

500|$|He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> not {{to present}} his own views {{of the meaning of}} his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

2500|$|To Pius XII, {{science and}} {{religion}} were heavenly sisters, different manifestations of divine exactness, who could not possibly contradict {{each other over the}} long term.

2500|$|Unlike Houphouët-Boigny, who <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> in {{avoiding}} any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedié emphasized {{the concept of}} [...] "Ivority" [...] (Ivoirité) to exclude his rival Alassane Ouattara, who had two northern Ivorian parents, from running for future presidential election. As people originating from foreign countries are {{a large part of}} the Ivoirian population, this policy excluded many people from Ivoirian nationality, and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained, which resulted in two civil wars in the following decades.|$|E

This communication occurred around 2006. Gorman wrote several articles about waste, fraud, and abuse at the NSA, including articles on Trailblazer. She received an award from the Society of Professional Journalists for her series exposing government wrongdoing.

2500|$|Censorship {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} element of Portuguese national culture throughout the country's history. [...] From its earliest history Portugal was subject to laws limiting freedom of expression. This was mainly due {{to the influence of}} the Church since the time of Ferdinand I, who requested that Pope Gregory XI institute episcopal censorship. Later, the censorship would also apply to the publication of other written works. Portuguese citizens still remember the Estado Novo's censorship policy, institutionalizing strict control over the media, resorting to measures used previously against newspapers and systematic sequestering of books. In fact, every political regime <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> with the legislation related to the area of press freedomin most cases restricting it. In the five centuries of the history of Portuguese press, four were marked by censorship.|$|E
2500|$|Paget <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> to {{keep his}} {{congregation}} distinct from other English-speaking congregations, both in Amsterdam and in the Netherlands more generally. Within a year of his taking up his post, possibly earlier, there was an English Baptist group, centred on John Smyth, in Amsterdam alongside his own and Johnson's congregations. Paget's aloofness can only have been reinforced by the internal divisions and the later confusions as the remnants of this group fused with the Dutch Mennonites known as Waterlanders after Smyth's death. He resolutely opposed what he regarded as schismatics of every kind. This included the more radical Calvinists. Key issues included formal prayer and an ordained ministry, which were rejected by Henry Ainsworth, Thomas Baker and other Brownist-influenced leaders, as Paget noted in his 1618 riposte, An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes, the occasion for which he claimed was: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bountys log {{shows that}} Bligh resorted to punishments {{relatively}} sparingly. He scolded when other captains would have whipped, and whipped when other captains would have hanged.

He tried (unsuccessfully) to check the spread of venereal disease among the men. The modern historian John Beaglehole has described the major flaw in this otherwise enlightened naval officer: [...] " [...] dogmatic judgements which he felt himself entitled to make; he saw fools about him too easily ... thin-skinned vanity was his curse through life ... never learnt that you do not make friends of men by insulting them." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Khrushchev was not {{hesitant}} {{to point out}} the flaws in Stalinist practice in regard to the purges of the army and Party and the management of the Great Patriotic War, he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> to avoid any criticism of Stalin's industrialization policy or Communist Party ideology. When discussing mass repressions, the absence of any commentary on the haphazard arrests of ordinary citizens is notable and, it must be assumed, purposeful, since occurrences like the brutality of collectivization served the interests of the party and the state. Khrushchev was a staunch party man, and he lauded Leninism and Communist ideology in his speech as often as he condemned Stalin's actions. Stalin, Khrushchev argued, was the primary victim of the deleterious effect of the cult of personality, which had, through his existing flaws, transformed him from a crucial part of the victories of Lenin into a paranoiac, easily influenced by the [...] "rabid enemy of our party", Lavrentiy Beria.|$|E
2500|$|Stokowski <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> in the {{placement}} of musicians during the recording sessions and consulted with the recording staff to achieve the best possible results. Some of the sessions {{took place in the}} ballroom of the Riverside Plaza Hotel in New York City in January and February 1957; these were produced by Richard C. Jones and engineered by Frank Abbey with Stokowski's own orchestra, which was typically drawn from New York musicians (primarily members of the Symphony of the Air). The CD reissue by EMI included selections originally released on two LPs [...] -- The Orchestra and Landmarks of a Distinguished Career—and featured music of Dukas, Barber, Richard Strauss, Harold Farberman, Vincent Persichetti, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Debussy, Bach (as arranged by Stokowski), and Sibelius. [...] Although he officially used the Ravel orchestration of the finale to Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition in his 1957 Capitol recording, he did add a few additional percussion instruments to the score. His Capitol recording of Holst's The Planets was made with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. EMI, which acquired Capitol and Angel Records in the 1950s, has reissued many of Stokowski's Capitol recordings on CD. All of the music that Stokowski conducted in Fantasia was released on a 3-LP set by Disneyland Records, in the 1957 soundtrack album made from the film. After stereo became possible on phonograph records, the album was released in stereo on Buena Vista Records. With the advent of compact discs, it appeared on a 2-CD Walt Disney Records set, in conjunction with the film's 50th anniversary.|$|E

In April, he met another success at the Critérium International, winning the overall classification and stage 2, a short, undulating stage of 98.5 kilometers finishing in Monthermé. Voigt attacked near the Côte du Mont Malgré Tout, with almost 25 kilometers to go, and crossed the finish line solo, 48 seconds in front of the chasers. The last stage of the race was a short individual time trial of 8.3 kilometers which was raced in the afternoon of the same day, and Voigt stated he gave everything he had but <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> while negotiating the turns.
