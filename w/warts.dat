5|$|Although genital <b>warts</b> {{are caused}} by a type of HPV, there is no {{statistically}} significant relationship between being circumcised {{and the presence of}} genital <b>warts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface. A.cinereoconia is distinguished from A.onusta {{by the absence of}} clamps, its powdery-wooly to powdery-warty cap, as well as the absence of <b>warts</b> or scales {{at the base of the}} stipe. A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter <b>warts</b> that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the <b>warts</b> on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E
5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect <b>warts</b> (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the <b>warts</b> are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the <b>warts,</b> and the flesh are white. The <b>warts</b> can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E

5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital <b>warts,</b> and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. Genital <b>warts</b> and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
5|$|The spores of R.virescens are {{elliptical}} or ellipsoid with <b>warts,</b> translucent (hyaline), {{and produce}} a white, pale or pale yellow spore print; the spore dimensions are 6–9 by 5–7µm. A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the <b>warts.</b> The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24–33 by 6–7.5µm; they are colorless, and each hold from two to four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 40–85 by 6–8µm and end abruptly in a sharp point.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, <b>warts,</b> tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The <b>warts</b> may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E

5|$|Its spores are spherical, {{measuring}} 8–13µm, {{and have}} a surface of irregular, coarse <b>warts.</b> The capillitium refers to late-maturing, thick-walled cells in the gleba. The main axes of these branched cells are 20–30µm thick, and they are covered with numerous spines.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has cream {{spore print}} {{with a slight}} salmon tinge. The spores are oval, with largish <b>warts</b> of around 1 {{micrometre}} (μm) which are joined by a well-developed network of mostly thin ridges. The spores measure 7.5–11μm by 6.5–9μm, and are amyloid or ellipsoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 8–12 by 6.5–9µm, broadly {{ellipsoid}} to ellipsoid, ornamented with <b>warts</b> and ridges that do {{not form}} a , prominences up to 0.8µm high, hyaline, and amyloid. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis—with the hyphae embedded in a slimy or gelatinized layer.|$|E

5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} {{that have}} lost their <b>warts</b> and have had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, A.nothofagi. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy—A.nothofagi does not have clamp connections {{at the base of}} the basidia, unlike A.australis.A.australis also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species A.abrupta, which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray <b>warts</b> and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E

5|$|Mycena adscendens {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are broadly , amyloid, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6.5µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14–17 by 7–9µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) {{may be present}} or absent. If present, they {{are similar to the}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28–44 by 8–12µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a swollen center) or with 2–3 needle-like projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or <b>warts.</b> The flesh of the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small <b>warts),</b> and all but the verrucose cells are -brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is similar}} to the North American species M.umbrinovinosa, which is {{distinguished}} by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M.urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly spaced <b>warts,</b> and clamp connections. Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M.fonticola, a species described concurrently with M.mustea. Unlike that of M.fonticola, the cap of M.mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up of smooth hyphae. In contrast, the cap of M.fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble <b>warts</b> or fingers.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{described}} {{from the}} Sierra Nevada, C.sculpta {{is found in}} mountainous areas in western North America, and {{was found in a}} Brazilian dune in 2008. It may be easily confused with Calbovista subsculpta, a similar puffball that—in addition to differences observable only with a microscope—is larger, and has slightly raised <b>warts</b> with a felt-like texture. Other similar species include Calvatia arctica and immature specimens of Amanita magniverrucata.|$|E

5|$|Spores of R.brevipes are egg-shaped to {{more or less}} spherical, {{and measure}} 7.5–10 by 6.5–8.5µm; they have a {{partially}} reticulate (network-like) surface dotted with <b>warts</b> measuring up to 1µm high. The cap cuticle is arranged {{in the form of}} a cutis (characterized by hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) comprising interwoven hyphae with rounded tips. There are no cystidia on the cap (pileocystidia).|$|E
5|$|The spores of L.echinatum, roughly spherical with <b>warts</b> on the surface, have diameters between 4 and 6µm. The capillitia (coarse {{thick-walled}} hyphae in the gleba) are elastic, {{brown in}} color, contain small pores, and are 5–8µm thick. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) may {{be attached to}} two to four spores, and the sterigmata (tapered spine-like projections from the basidia that attach the spores) are up to 5µm long.|$|E
5|$|Although the puffball was {{originally}} described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, {{it was not}} published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, from which it can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent pyramidal <b>warts,</b> and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E

40|$|Relaxation mental imagery (RMI), {{standard}} topical treatment (TopTx), {{and equal}} time-control interventions were compared {{on measures of}} <b>wart</b> regression in sixty one, 6 – 12 -year-old children. Subjects chose one common (“index”) <b>wart</b> and attended 4 visits over 8 weeks. At each visit, total and “index” extremity <b>wart</b> number were counted and a photo was taken of the “index wart” for later measurement. On average, total <b>wart</b> number decreased by 10 % and “index wart” area decreased by 20 % with no significant group differences during the first eight weeks. Phone follow was conducted 6 to 18 months from study entry. At phone follow up, there was a trend for more RMI and TopTx subjects to report complete <b>wart</b> resolution (p = 0. 07) with a majority of RMI children reporting use of RMI or no specific treatment pursuit.
