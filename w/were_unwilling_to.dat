5|$|Although many {{leaders of}} the Congress sought a strong central {{government}} for an Indian state, some Muslim politicians, including Jinnah, <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> accept this without powerful protections for their community. Other Muslims supported the Congress, which advocated a secular state upon independence. Nevertheless, the Congress enjoyed considerable Muslim support up to about 1937.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping {{to persuade the}} Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the king was {{ultimately}} unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Tom Tureen (the tribes' lawyer) {{tried to}} {{negotiate}} a cash settlement. At first Maine's governor, James B. Longley, Maine's attorney general, Joseph Brennan, and the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation, the largest landowner in the state, <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> discuss a settlement. With no one to negotiate with, Tureen devoted his energy to assisting the Solicitors Office in researching the legal and historical basis of the claim.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of India is an Asian {{leader in}} its own right and has <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> {{subordinate}} itself to anyone else. While India aspires to achieve geopolitical and commercial parity with China, it has at the same time <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> align its national interests to serve global or regional powers.|$|R
5000|$|His trusted spies were Johannes de Silentio, and Constantin Constantius. Johannes {{handed him}} a note and said nothing more. The note said, “in modern philosophy, every {{assistant}} professor, tutor, and student, every rural outsider and tenant incumbent in philosophy <b>is</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> stop with doubting everything but goes further. … people <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> stop with faith.” ...|$|R

5|$|Having already {{released}} precious destroyers for convoy duty, they <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> further {{weaken the}} ability of the U.S. to defend itself through the scattering of the all-important battle fleet. Furthermore, Admiral Benson was uneasy about the prospect, ever-present in the early 20th century, of a second war breaking out with Japan. For the moment, the U.S. Navy would send destroyers to Europe, but no battleships.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, Belcourt {{travelled}} to Rainy Lake {{to examine}} sites for a mission. He abandoned the plan after discovering that the First Nations people <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> {{give up their}} Hudson's Bay Company-supplied liquor, as he required for conversion to Christianity. In August 1838, the priest arranged to have a dictionary published in the Chippewa language, {{and returned to his}} mission at Baie-Saint-Paul. In the winter of 1839, Belcourt carved 280 oak balusters and candlesticks for his log chapel.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, Neill {{left the}} Alamo, {{determined}} to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. He transferred command to Travis, the highest-ranking regular army {{officer in the}} garrison. Volunteers comprised much of the garrison, and they <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> accept Travis as their leader. The men instead elected Bowie, who {{had a reputation as}} a fierce fighter, as their commander. Bowie celebrated by getting very intoxicated and creating havoc in Béxar. To mitigate the resulting ill feelings, Bowie agreed to share command with Travis.|$|E

50|$|Ultimately, Cormacke O'Murphy {{was assassinated}} by disgruntled associate. Father Murphy, however, <b>was</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> give up.|$|R
5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|The {{aforementioned}} Cardinals plus Borja's own vote numbered 14, {{one short}} of the required two-third majority. However, Cardinals Carafa, Costa, Piccolomini, Cibò, and Zeno, followed by Medici, <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> be bribed. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, followed by Basso, was intractably opposed to Borja's election. Thus, the eighty-six-year-old Gherardo, the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, who was paid only 5,000 ducats, constituted the deciding vote.|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board Gothenburg tried {{to cling to}} the rigging, but {{throughout}} the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept overboard by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> let go of their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned very quickly.|$|E
50|$|Marirrosi, {{the oldest}} of the three women, has a grown up son and is tired of her job in Bilbao. She finds love with Alfonso, a gentle soft-spoken gardener. However, she <b>is</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> give up city life for fields and cows, while he <b>is</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> even {{consider}} living in a city. Unable to resolve their differences, she eventually breaks up with him.|$|R
50|$|Jack and Amanda face an {{unplanned}} pregnancy {{that nearly}} destroys their relationship. Jack and Amanda both have grown {{children and the}} prospect of having another child is unacceptable to Jack, he refuses to even consider the idea. Amanda while shocked, <b>is</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> terminate the pregnancy. The pregnancy drives a wedge between Jack and Amanda. Neither <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> compromise on their beliefs about the pregnancy.|$|R

5|$|While {{incurring}} significant casualties {{fighting the}} Black Legion, the Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia {{benefited from the}} mass desertion of Partisans and the many pro-Chetnik coups in Partisan and volunteer detachments. Despite their lack of unity, the Chetnik movement thrived in eastern Bosnia for the reminder of 1942 because some Chetnik leaders made accommodations with the Ustaše regime and as many Chetniks and Partisans <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> kill fellow Bosnian Serbs of the opposing faction.|$|E
5|$|With various {{plans for}} using {{the route of the}} canal for {{landfill}} and for a bypass, some local interest was aroused regarding its future. The Tiverton Canal Preservation Committee was formed in 1962. This committee was stirred to action by plans in 1966 to infill parts of the canal so that housing could be built over it. Tiverton Borough Council gave the committee the power to negotiate with the British Waterways Board in March 1967, but the Board <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> offer financial assistance.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{replaced}} {{his agent}} Arn Tellem with Scott Boras in July 2006. Zito was {{a focal point}} of the 2006 trade deadline, and was widely rumored to be headed to the Mets in a potential deal for prospect Lastings Milledge. Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that if the Mets <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> trade Milledge, the Athletics might be interested in Aaron Heilman and John Maine. However, Athletics' general manager Billy Beane decided to keep Zito {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> {{launch a}} full-scale campaign in Northern Ireland {{due to the}} possibility of civilians being killed. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups. The bridge had been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by Indigenous communities who <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial was}} delayed due to legal issues, as many Indian lawyers <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} him. A Mumbai Bar Association {{passed a resolution}} proclaiming that none of its members would represent Kasab. However, the Chief Justice of India stated that Kasab needed a lawyer for a fair trial. A lawyer for Kasab was eventually found, but was replaced due to a conflict of interest. On 25 February 2009, Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page chargesheet, formally charging Kasab with murder, conspiracy, and waging war against India among other charges.|$|E

5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of {{one aspect of the}} treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E
