25|$|In the finals, Ginebra met San Miguel {{and fell}} behind 0–2 {{in the series}} similar to their 2001 showdown. But unlike in 2001, this time the outcome was different. The Kings would win the next four games, with games 3 and 4 being blowouts, to win the 2006-07 PBA Philippine Cup, {{becoming}} only the fifth PBA team to win the title after losing the first two games. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sweet</b> revenge for the Kings as Helterbrand, who sank two crucial free throws in Game 6, was named Finals MVP.

25|$|The Grand Final {{against the}} Sydney Roosters {{was always going}} to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16-13. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much {{punishment}} and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sweet</b> result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons on and off the field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs.

500|$|Another American star {{provided}} by Robert L. Lippert was Margia Dean, who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen, Dean was allegedly cast {{on account of}} her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras. According to executive producer Michael Carreras, [...] "Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures, but he didn't want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so he set it up though his friend Bob Lippert". Val Guest recalled of her, [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sweet</b> girl, but she couldn't act". Her American accent was considered {{out of place in}} the film and so her lines were dubbed in post production.|$|E

[...] Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot’s always going to forgive him.

500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{rated the}} episode with an [...] "A" [...] grade. He felt the episode was the [...] "highlight" [...] of the season. McNutt applauded that Michael was portrayed {{in a way}} that was neither [...] "too dumb or too ignorant" [...] and that he was able to have the final moment where he showed that he was a skilled salesman. Despite noting that the sting was not realistic, he further enjoyed that Michael, Dwight, and Jim were allowed to react to the {{situation}} rather than becoming part of it. Jason Hughes of AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review and praised the use of Meredith, calling her [...] "hilarious and so spot-on". Furthermore, he, like McNutt, enjoyed that Michael was portrayed as competent in the end. Hughes also enjoyed the B-story and wrote that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sweet</b> moment when Darryl told Andy he didn't have to pay him any more to jam with them".|$|E

[...] Carla Alcorn's post was subsequently deleted, and her Facebook account was made private. The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District. In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that [...] "Joshua Alcorn <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sweet,</b> talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident.

2500|$|Although her {{previous}} album {{was a huge}} success, Yener decided to improve and refine her music style once more. She would leave the Türk pop, paving the way to incorporate a more dance-friendly Europop sound, along with changing [...] her appearance as well. She cut and dyed her black from blonde. The result was [...] "Apayrı" [...] (Totally Different), which came out in early 2006. Some of the hit singles that came out from [...] "Apayrı" [...] included, [...] "Kelepçe" [...] (Handcuffs), [...] "Aşkın Ateşi" [...] (The Fire of Love) and [...] "Kim Bilebilir Aşkı" [...] (Who Can Guess What Love Is).

2500|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was believed}} that up to the mid-19th century, Barolo <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sweet</b> wine. This was attributed {{to the fact that the}} Nebbiolo grape ripens late in October meant that temperatures would be steadily dropping by harvest. By November and December, temperatures in the Piedmont region would be cold enough to halt fermentation, leaving a significant amount of residual sugar left in the wine. Another popular credence was that in the mid-19th century, Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, the mayor of Grinzane Cavour invited the French enologist Louis Oudart to the Barolo region to improve the winemaking techniques of the local producers. Using techniques focusing on improving the hygiene of the cellar, Oudart was able to ferment the Nebbiolo must completely dry, making the first modern Barolo. This new, [...] "dry" [...] red wine soon became a favorite among the nobility of Turin and the ruling House of Savoy, giving rise to the popular description of Barolo as [...] "the wine of kings, the king of wines".|$|E

To promote the tour, Hutchence and Barnes shared vocals on: The Easybeats cover [...] "Good Times" [...] and [...] "Laying Down the Law" [...] which Barnes cowrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly.

It peaked at No.2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film The Lost Boys and its soundtrack, allowing it to peak at No.47 in the U.S. on 1 August 1987.

2500|$|Jobs {{told his}} {{official}} biographer that after meeting Simpson, {{he wanted to}} become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When Jandali was found working in Sacramento, Jobs decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching to join the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that [...] "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." [...] (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs). Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that [...] "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sweet</b> guy, and a big tipper." [...] After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that [...] "it was amazing... I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands." [...] However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because [...] "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it... I asked Mona not to tell him about me." [...] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked [...] "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" [...] Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, [...] "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive... he never contacted Steve." [...] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father. She would also create a fictional portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, A Regular Guy.|$|E
2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot."
