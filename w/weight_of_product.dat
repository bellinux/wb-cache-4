It is necessary to reflect the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> for earliness and tardiness at decision epochs to decide on the optimal strategy. This research demonstrates the use of Stochastic Utility Evaluation (SUE) function approach to optimize system performance using multiple criteria. In addition, this research explores how SUE function using stochastic information can be derived and used to strategically improve existing approaches. SUE function for earliness and tardiness is used in an existing model to develop a triobjective problem. Typically, this problem is very complex to solve due to its trade-off relationship. However SUE function makes it relatively easy to solve the tri-objective problem since SUE function can be incorporated in an existing model. It is observed that SUE function can be effectively used for solving a tri-objective problem. ...|$|R

Based on these insights, implications for the design of food and beverages packaging are discussed...|$|E

30|$|Here, we used {{mortar and}} pestle to grind the product. As {{mentioned}} earlier, we conducted each experiment for 30  min and ground the sample after that. Grinding helps in scrubbing off the outer nonporous layer of MgCO 3. And we performed grinding until we noticed no change in product weight after subsequent experiments. In general, after 3 – 4 cycles, we observed {{no change in the}} <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>product.</b> It is certain that such intermittent grinding step is limited to the laboratory and cannot be seen as an industrial operation. Therefore, it is recommended to have an aggregative fluidization regime for a fluidized bed reactor while scaling up MgO–CO 2 reaction. Also, increasing the amount of water vapor cannot lead to the complete carbonate conversion of MgO. Thus, in addition to the amount of steam, surface properties of MgO (such as surface area, particle size, porosity) are also very crucial parameters for the carbonation process.|$|E

The goal of our project was to develop a product that stores the energy which is {{normally}} lost during braking, and reuses it to help propel the rider when starting. This was accomplished with a spring and cone system whose parameters were optimized based on engineering, consumer preference, and manufacturing models. The resulting product is one which is practical and potentially very profitable in the market place. A spring (of tension 22, 100 N/m) is stretched (at most 37 cm) by a wire which wraps around a cone (of 15 cm large diameter and 2 cm small diameter), while braking. A clutch is then released and the cone drives the bike’s gears to assist the rider while starting.

The problem arising is, although different techniques for processing online reviews are developed, the techniques are rarely seen on accelerating the design work flows.

The first stage is a supervised learning routine to identify product characteristics. This procedure calculates the surrounding words ’ posterior probability.

Distinct from existing classification and rank algorithms, this stage informs an ordinal classification algorithm to balance the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> characteristics. This algorithm depicts a pairwise approach to achieve ordinal classification. Furthermore, an integer none linear programming model is advised, which targets at recovering pairwise results to the original class for each object.

The results validate the feasibility of the two stage framework, and the possibility to explore targeted models from online reviews for product designers...|$|E

The final reaction mass contains {{greater than or equal to}} 80 % (by <b>weight)</b> <b>of</b> <b>product.</b> This article deals with acid-base effects in such reaction mixtures and the consequences for the enzyme. In the Thermoase-catalyzed synthesis of Z-Asp-Phe-OMe, the reaction rate is strongly dependent on the amount of basic salts added to the system. The rate increases 20 times, as the KHCO 3 or K 2 CO 3 added is raised 2. 25 -fold from an amount equimolar to the Phe-OMe. HCL starting material. With further increases in KHCO 3 addition, the initial rate remains at the maximum, but with K 2 CO 3 it drops sharply. Addition of NaHCO 3 is less effective, but rates are faster if more water is used. With > 1. 5 equivalents of basic salt, the final yield of the reaction decreases. Similar effects are observed when thermolysin catalyzes the same reaction, or Z-Gln-Leu-NH 2, synthesis. These effects can be rationalized using a model estimating the pH of these systems, taking into account the possible formation of up to ten different solid phases.
