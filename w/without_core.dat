50|$|The Kienle {{resonators}} can {{be manufactured}} both as simple tubes, with a circular cross-section (without labium), and traditional organ pipes as “pipe resonators” (with labium, but <b>without</b> <b>core).</b> Mostly, the resonators {{for the key}} tones of the lower frequencies (below 64 Hz) and the resonators for the higher frequencies (above 500 Hz) are built without a labium. In this case, not every resonator must be stimulated by its own loudspeaker. The resonators with a tube diameter of approximately 120 mm working at very low frequencies are often activated by a so-called collective stimulation which stimulates simultaneously five to ten resonators by means {{of one or two}} bass loudspeakers. In the case of high frequencies, several resonators with tube diameters of only approximately 5 - 25 mm, can be positioned above only one loudspeaker.|$|E

50|$|The crew glided {{for several}} minutes {{and then tried to}} restart engines using the APU at 13000 ft. This was again unsuccessful. They then {{declared}} to Air Traffic Control (ATC) that they had a single-engine flameout. At this point they had four diversion airports available to them. They lost considerable altitude while continuing unsuccessfully to attempt to restart both the left engine (two times) and the right engine (two times) for over 14 minutes, using the emergency restart procedure. Despite their four auxiliary power-unit-assisted engine restart attempts, the pilots were unable to restart the engines because their cores had locked. <b>Without</b> <b>core</b> rotation, recovery from the double engine failure was not possible.

5000|$|The Design Basis Accident (DBA) for {{a nuclear}} power plant is the most severe {{possible}} single accident that the designers of the plant and the regulatory authorities could reasonably expect. It is, also, by definition, the accident the safety systems of the reactor are designed to respond to successfully, even if it occurs when the reactor is in its most vulnerable state. The DBA for the BWR consists of the total rupture of a large coolant pipe in the location that is considered to place the reactor in the most danger of harm—specifically, for older BWRs (BWR/1-BWR/6), the DBA consists of a [...] "guillotine break" [...] in the coolant loop of one of the recirculation jet pumps, which is substantially below the core waterline (LBLOCA, large break loss of coolant accident) combined with loss of feedwater {{to make up for the}} water boiled in the reactor (LOFW, loss of proper feedwater), combined with a simultaneous collapse of the regional power grid, resulting in a loss of power to certain reactor emergency systems (LOOP, loss of offsite power). The BWR is designed to shrug this accident off <b>without</b> <b>core</b> damage.|$|E

40|$|Respiration rate at 4 oC {{and minimal}} {{processing}} of rambutan cv. ‘Rong-Rien’ were investigated. Rambutan was harvested from Amphur Ban Na San, Surat Thani Province, {{at the stage}} when its skin was turning into a combination of red, green and yellow. After harvesting, the fruits were size-graded to 27 - 30 fruits/kg, hydrocooled to 14 oC, packed with ice in Styrofoam boxes and transported to the laboratory at Prince of Songkla University within 6 h. The respiration rate of fresh rambutan fruits was monitored. For minimal processing, the fruits were soaked in warm solution (55 oC) of 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite for one min and immediately cooled in cold water until their internal temperature reached 14 oC. The minimal process included peeling, with and <b>without</b> <b>coring.</b> The peeled and peeled and cored rambutan samples were immersed in a solution of 0. 5 % citric acid + 0. 5 % CaCl 2 at 4 oC for 2 min. The average respiration rates (within 6 h) at 4 oC of whole fruit, peeled, and peeled and cored rambutan samples were measured and found to be 122, 134 and 143 mg CO 2 /kg/h, respectively. These findings indicated that a preparation style as peeled rambutan <b>without</b> <b>coring,</b> nylon/LLDPE bag, storage temperature of 4. 0 ± 1 oC, were suitably applied for processed rambutans.

40|$|We {{study the}} formal {{properties}} of correspondences of curves <b>without</b> a <b>core,</b> {{focusing on the}} case of étale correspondences. The motivating examples come from Hecke correspondences of Shimura curves. Given a correspondence <b>without</b> a <b>core,</b> we construct an infinite graph G_gen together with a large group of "algebraic" automorphisms A. The graph G_gen measures the "generic dynamics" of the correspondence. We construct specialization maps G_gen→G_phys to the "physical dynamics" of the correspondence. We also prove results on the number of bounded étale orbits, in particular generalizing a recent theorem of Hallouin and Perret. We use a variety of techniques: Galois theory, the theory of groups acting on infinite graphs, and finite group schemes. Comment: part of the author's thesis. Comments welcome...|$|R
