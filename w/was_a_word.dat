5|$|The name Malkin {{has several}} {{possible}} derivations: {{it was a}} familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman; the similar mawkin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> used to describe a lower-class woman or slut. Malkin was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin, and was an old northern English name for a hare, into which witches {{were said to be}} able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.|$|E
25|$|Insulae {{have been}} the subject of great debate for historians of Roman culture, {{defining}} the various meanings of the word. Insula <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> used to describe apartment buildings, or the apartments themselves, meaning apartment, or inhabitable room, demonstrating just how small apartments for Plebes were. Urban divisions were originally street blocks, and later began to divide into smaller divisions, the word insula referring to both blocks and smaller divisions. The insula contained cenacula, tabernae, storage rooms under the stairs, and lower floor shops. Another type of housing unit for Plebes was a cenaculum, an apartment, divided into three individual rooms: cubiculum, exedra, and medianum. Common Roman apartments were mainly masses of smaller and larger structures, many with narrow balconies that present mysteries as to their use, having no doors to access them, and they lacked the excessive decoration and display of wealth that aristocrats’ houses contained. Luxury in houses was not common, as the life of the average person did not consist of being in their houses, as they instead would go to public baths, and engage in other communal activities.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{initiation}} ceremony and induction into {{the society and}} the receiving of the word, the horseman who were not {{members of the society}} but potential candidates would have trouble with horses. This would often be caused by older ploughmen who were members of the society tampering with their horses. They would put things like tacks under the horse's collar to cause it to behave irrationally. This would be unknown to the potential candidate as the techniques for training and controlling the horses were not yet given to him. Most of these techniques were based on the horse's sharp sense of smell. Foul substances placed in front of the horse or on the animal itself would cause it to refuse to move forward. This technique is known as jading and is still used by horse trainers today. There were also pleasant smelling things that were used to make a horse move forward or calm down. If the substance was an oil it could be wiped on the trainer's forehead, they would then {{stand in front of the}} animal and the smell would draw it towards them. This practice was often used in taming unruly horses. There were also pleasant smelling and inviting materials, such as sweets, that the horseman could keep in their pocket in order to calm, attract, and subdue a crazed horse. Keeping these techniques secret, along with the myth that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> that only the horseman knew that gave them and them alone power over horses helped guarantee their reputation, prestige, job security, and pay. The same type of logic and protection of trade secrets can be seen among modern magicians who keep their tricks secret and only share them with other members of their trade.|$|E

500|$|A leading actor of {{a younger}} generation, Albert Finney, has said that Richardson was not really an actor at all, but a magician. Miller, who interviewed {{a large number of}} Richardson's colleagues for his 1995 biography, notes that when talking about Richardson's acting, [...] "magical" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> many of them used. The Guardian judged Richardson [...] "indisputably our most poetic actor". For The Times, he [...] "was ideally {{equipped}} to make an ordinary character seem extraordinary or an extraordinary one seem ordinary".

2500|$|When the Greeks {{adapted the}} Phoenician alphabet, they took over {{not only the}} letter shapes and sound values, but also the names by which the {{sequence}} of the alphabet could be recited and memorized.

Also, the name [...] "Iwate" [...] was a made-up name from a play titled Iwate, so there is no way a person named that could have really existed.

Historically, kare <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> in the demonstrative {{paradigm}} (i.e., a system involving demonstrative prefixes, ko-, so-, is-, and a-), used to point to an object that is physically far but psychologically near. The feminine counterpart kanojo, on the other hand, {{is a combination of}} kano (adjective version of ka-) and jo ("woman"), coined for the translation of its Western equivalents. It was not until the Meiji period that kare and kanojo were commonly used as the masculine and feminine pronoun {{in the same way as}} their Western equivalents.

2500|$|Science in its {{original}} sense <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge.

This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public works at national scale, such which those which harnessed the floodplain of the Yangtse with reservoirs, dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids. [...] However, no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems.|$|E
