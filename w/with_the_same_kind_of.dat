5|$|The Tranquebar Association, {{formed in}} 2001, {{with the help}} of the Tamil Nadu State Archaeological Department and the Danish Royal family, {{restored}} the South end of the fort <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> material like brick and black stone, used during the original construction. The renovation was completed in 2005, with contributions from local artisans, Danish volunteers, Danish and Indian experts. In 2001, chemists from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) restored the portrait of Raja Ragunatha Naik, Tranquebar site map, pottery, portrait of Christian IV, the Danish King. Metal Halide lamps, which provide a uniform green-coloured lighting, were used for illuminating the exteriors. The restored complex was opened by the Collector of the Nagapattinam District in 2002.|$|E

25|$|The Seri {{language}} is a head-final language. The verb typically occurs {{at the end of}} a clause (after the subject and direct object, in that order), and main clauses typically follow dependent clauses. The possessor precedes the possessum. The language does not have many true adjectives; adjective-like verbs follow the head noun in the same kind of construction and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> morphology as verbs in the language. The words that correspond to prepositions in languages like English are usually constrained to appear before the verb; in noun phrases they appear following their complement.|$|E

500|$|A {{certain degree}} of the {{eventual}} amount of white, and its [...] "design", is completely random. The development of an organism from single-celled to fully formed is a process with many, many steps. Even beginning with identical genomes, as in clones and identical twins, the process is unlikely to occur the same way twice. A process with this element of randomness is called a stochastic process, and cell differentiation is, in part, a stochastic process. The stochastic element of development is {{partly responsible for the}} eventual appearance of white on a horse, potentially accounting for nearly a quarter of the phenotype. The research team that studied dominant white cited [...] "subtle variations in the amount of residual KIT protein" [...] as a potential cause for the variability in phenotype of horses <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dominant white.|$|E

2500|$|The third grave {{strategic}} miscalculation made by {{the retreating}} nationalist regime {{was similar to the}} second one, but this one was about its own troops left behind during the Second Sino-Japanese War. [...] The resource strained nationalist government could not provide enough supports to these troops left behind the enemy lines, who were forced to turn to banditry for survival when they were left on their own, and this had alienated many of the troops left behind, and it was impossible to expect them to fight their communist enemy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dedication like those nationalist agents who believed in their political cause, or the American trained new forces. [...] The banditry also alienated the local populace and caused the nationalists to lose popular support. [...] Compounding the problem, due to the need of bandits’ knowledge of local area, {{and the fact that they}} were the only pro-nationalist force in the region, they were often rewarded with higher ranks than the highly trained regular nationalist troops sent to Northeast China. [...] As a result, the regular nationalist troops sent to Northeast China after World War II lacked any willingness to work together with the bandits, especially when many of the bandits were former warlords’s troops cooperated with Japanese invaders. [...] Many loyal nationalists were enraged by the fact that they had to serve under the former-enemy they once fought: in all, Chiang’s government awarded bandits with many high military ranks: 32 commander-in-chiefs, 33 army commanders, and 158 division commanders in all. [...] In contrast, the highly trained regular nationalist army sent to Northeast China after World War II had much fewer similar ranks, meaning that most highly qualified professional officers ranked below bandits. [...] Meanwhile, the bandits lacked the similar willingness and attempted to expend those nationalist troops whenever they could to save their own skin, and often used the superior ranks Chiang’s government given to them as their excuses to ignore correct strategies ordered by the nationalist regular army.|$|E

His sister Barbara, afflicted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> of drug problems as her brother, committed suicide in 1977, which also helped contribute to the perception that Ted could have been vulnerable to suicide as well.

Yet we have but few traces of the labour, by which he doubtless attained, and secured, his place in society. A short satire on the Dutch, written to animate the people of England against them, appeared in 1662.[46] It is somewhat in the hard style of invective, which Cleveland applied to the Scottish nation; yet Dryden thought it worth while to weave <b>the</b> <b>same</b> verses into <b>the</b> prologue and epilogue of the tragedy of [...] "Amboyna," [...] a piece written in 1673, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> intentions towards <b>the</b> states-general.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{we argue}} that the {{association}} between R&D spending and performance is different for SOEs in China. First, unlike non-SOEs that mainly focus on economic performance, SOEs have multiple goals including social and political contributions. Therefore, their choice of R&D projects is not purely based on whether an innovation would improve economic performance or not. Therefore, R&D spending may not be done <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> of economic benefits as for non-SOEs in mind, thus <b>the</b> relationship <b>with</b> future performance is less established. Second, with priority for resources and government support, the performance of SOEs in China is less sensitive to R&D spending than for non-SOEs. We state our fourth hypothesis as follows.|$|R

5000|$|Whitam's {{early work}} {{focused on the}} {{sociology}} of religion before he moved into researching commonalities in male homosexuality in different cultures. Whitam told Newsweek, [...] "If {{you look at all}} societies, homosexuality occurs at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> of behavior. That suggests something biological going on. The biological evidence has been growing for 20 or more years." [...] He also studied trans women, reporting that in many cultures [...] "these persons regard themselves as homosexuals and are regarded by more masculine homosexuals as a natural part of the homosexual world." [...] Whitam's published books included The Protestant Spanish Community in New York in 1960 and Male Homosexuality in Four Societies: Brazil, Guatemala, the Philippines, and the United States, co-authored with Robin Mathy in 1986.

40|$|As {{described}} in previous reports, {{the effects of}} moderate temperatures (up to 230 C) is to increase molecular/macromolecular mobility in coals, as determined by {sup 1 }H CRAMPS (Combined Rotation And Multiple Pulse Spectroscopy) measurements, especially dipolar-dephasing experiments. Pyridine-saturated coals have also been studied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> of NMR experiments. The author found that thermal activation and solvent saturation promote the molecular mobility of coals in quite different ways.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{possibility}} of using a combination of reputation and collaborative filtering systems to create a more robust and accurate system. The main target of such a system would be an e-commerce website or on-line auction setting. The main mechanism this proposal presents centers on using reputations to improve recommendations made in a collaborative filtering setting. We also briefly discuss an approach which uses collaborative filtering to improve reputation systems, as a suggestion for future work. In the case of the main mechanism we predict noticeable improvements in the accuracy of predictions, because of the additional weight provided by the extra information we take into account. We mention a number of problems with existing reputation and collaborative filtering systems, and discuss how the proposed system would deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> of issues...|$|R
50|$|L1 attriters, like L2 learners, may use {{language}} differently from native speakers. In particular, {{they can have}} variability on certain rules which native speakers apply deterministically. In the context of attrition, however, there is strong evidence that this optionality is not indicative of any underlying representational deficits: <b>the</b> <b>same</b> individuals {{do not appear to}} encounter recurring problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> of grammatical phenomena in different speech situations or on different tasks. This suggests that problems of L1 attriters are due to momentary conflicts between the two linguistic systems and not indicative of a structural change to underlying linguistic knowledge (that is, to an emerging representational deficit of any kind). This assumption is in line with a range of investigations of L1 attrition which argue that this process may affect interface phenomena (e.g. the distribution of overt and null subjects in pro-drop languages) but will not touch the narrow syntax.|$|R
