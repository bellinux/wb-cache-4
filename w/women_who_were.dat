5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E

Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback.

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> from poorer areas {{and could be}} easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E

50|$|Sperm {{competition}} risk also influences males' {{choice of}} female partners.

Following the above, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at an intermediate risk of sperm competition, that <b>is</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not in a long-term relationship but who do engage in short-term mating or have casual sexual partners, are considered intermediate in desirability for short-term sexual partners.|$|R
5|$|Feminist cinema, advocating or {{illustrating}} feminist perspectives, arose largely {{with the}} development of feminist film theory in the late '60s and early '70s. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, Women and Film. Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.|$|E

Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> easy to dominate and mould.
