5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} grilled, broiled or occasionally fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common {{characteristics of a}} rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked to suit the diner's preference. Steaks cooked <b>well-done</b> are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked <b>well-done</b> will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not <b>well-done,</b> as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E
5|$|Writing for American Humor, {{academic}} Robert G. Pielke {{observed that}} the sketch was a very <b>well-done,</b> and moving, reflection on NBC management's fealty to Nielsen ratings and profit. Pielke went on to analyze the sketch and characterized it {{as an example of}} Saturday Night Live resisting conformist authority. He commented that an injustice had been wrought by NBC the company, whereas the NBC executives who came to shut down Star Trek were simply pawns in the process. He posited that the U.S.S. Enterprise crew members were against cancelling the television program because their self-worth had become tied to it. Pielke noted that {{within the confines of the}} sketch's plot itself, as each crew member realized there was no option other than cancellation, they each showed their actual identity and humanity.|$|E

25|$|The freakish {{conditions}} spawned unique effects: a car {{was forced}} 90m along a road with its handbrake on, burning mattresses were seen hurtling through the air, steaks were cooked <b>well-done</b> in deep freezers, road surfaces bubbled and caught fire and sand liquefied to glass. CSIRO experts later reported that, from evidence of melted metal, {{the heat of}} the fires after the change rose to 2000°C, exceeding that recorded during the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II. In fact, the Ash Wednesday fires were measured at around 60,000 kilowatts of heat energy per metre, leading to similarities with the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game's graphics, {{specifically}} {{pointing out the}} character and background designs as being high-quality for PS2 games of the time. GameSpy called the graphics [...] "mind-blowing", and GameSpot praised the game's smooth frame rate. GameZone noted the animation of Ratchet, praising the details in his animation. Reviewers found that the game's voice overs and other audio elements were generally <b>well-done.</b> IGN commented on the game's artificial intelligence, {{saying that it was}} not as <b>well-done</b> as that of , but still [...] "purposefully comic and somewhat sophisticated" [...] in others. Gameplanet felt that the game's levels were well laid-out.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks reached #20 on the Japan Oricon charts. It {{received}} mixed reviews. Gann {{liked the}} newly orchestrated tracks, calling them [...] "incredibly <b>well-done</b> orchestrations", {{and said that}} [...] "depending on how willing you are to spend money" [...] they made the album worth purchasing on their own, although he felt the other tracks offered nothing new to owners of the original soundtrack. Chris of Square Enix Music Online, however, felt that while the orchestrated tracks were <b>well-done,</b> {{the selection of the}} other tracks was poor and that the album as a whole was [...] "a lousy purchase for most who enjoyed Final Fantasy VIIs score".|$|E
500|$|... "In [...] 3 {{slowness}} indicates care, prides in work <b>well-done.</b> Slowness in [...] 4 indicates sluggishness, poor motor coordinate, {{some physical}} retardation" [...] We perceive our overall impression by integrating {{the relationships of}} the different qualities of a person. Therefore, we form very different impressions when one of these qualities differ.|$|E
500|$|As a folk musician, Schmertz {{released}} four albums, {{with his}} third, Sing Oh! The City Oh!: Songs of Early Pittsburgh, in {{commemoration of the}} 200th anniversary of Pittsburgh's founding; a reviewer for Keystone Folklore Quarterly called it [...] "tuneful and <b>well-done</b> in the folk tradition". Before his death, Schmertz completed a book of his songs, but died before it published. Ten days after he suffered a stroke, Schmertz died on June 7, 1975.|$|E
500|$|... "Reaction" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with television}} critics singling out Dr. Octopus' portrayal. Octopus's character design was applauded {{by both the}} designers and Coyle; the latter noted that his design allowed her to direct them freely in different manners, and that the arms in particular were particularly <b>well-done.</b> Peter MacNicol voiced the character and used a voice inspired by that of late actor Laird Cregar. It is available on both the third volume DVD set for the series, {{as well as the}} complete season box set.|$|E
500|$|Going Commandos {{graphics}} were {{praised by}} reviewers, who specifically mentioned Ratchet's improved character design. Game Informer said that [...] "the graphical details {{will leave you}} speechless..." [...] GameSpot considered the reuse of graphics for the menus and mission screens to be [...] "a little lazy", but praised the graphics and sound effects of the game's weapons. GameSpy mentioned that [...] "Going Commando is easily the most graphically impressive platformer on the market". GameZone reported that the game's sound was <b>well-done,</b> including the music, weapon effects, and dialogue.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} environments were praised as detailed. According to Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot, [...] "The game looks its best in corroded, bloody, gritty environments, like the damp, steel halls of the water prison or the subterranean subway layers that, {{at one point in}} the game, are walled in living, moving flesh." [...] The character and monster designs received praise as <b>well-done.</b> Reviewers generally commended the audio as contributing to the horror {{of the game}}, although 1UP wrote that it was sub-par for the series.|$|E
500|$|Outside soundtrack reviews, {{opinions}} from {{reviews of}} the game itself have also been positive. IGNs Ed Lewis called the music [...] "appropriately dramatic", though stated it was often {{drowned out by the}} ambient noise and voice acting. GameSpots Greg Mueller called the music [...] "varied and interesting", while stating that the vocal theme was [...] "sappy, but it's used sparingly enough, so it doesn't get terribly annoying". The GameTrailers reviewer cited the score as [...] "top-notch", referring to it {{as one of the few}} <b>well-done</b> aspects of the game.|$|E
500|$|The album reached #59 on the Japan Oricon charts. Adam Corn of SoundtrackCentral.com claimed [...] "the {{superior}} instrumental quality, <b>well-done</b> arrangements, and tasteful {{selection of}} themes boost the [...] qualities while hiding its flaws", elaborating that [...] "even people such as myself who are not fans of the original will be impressed by its prowess, and fans will simply be enamored". Neal Chandran of RPGFan was similarly impressed, {{saying that it was}} [...] "a very good soundtrack" [...] and that its tracks sounded [...] "more beautiful than the original version". His primary complaint was that he would have liked for the album to include more pieces.|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} the manga was {{inspired}} by [...] "the darker, grislier side" [...] of the Victorian upper class and her admiration of films set in the Victorian time period. For Godchild, she traveled to London to do historical research and visited seven historical sites there. In the series, she refers to the Bible as well as real-life literary works, films and people. Reviewers have found a range of themes in the series. Critical reaction to The Cain Saga was mixed: some felt that the mysteries were <b>well-done</b> with detailed art, while others found the art crude and the short stories confusing and predictable. Reviewers praised Godchild as an overdone, entertaining series with detailed and distinct art.|$|E
500|$|Schmertz's third album, Sing Oh! the City Oh!: Songs of Early Pittsburgh, {{released}} on Folkways Records in 1959, featured folk songs, such as [...] "Celeron", named after Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville, and [...] "The Battle of Bushy Run", {{after the battle}} of the same name, in commemoration of the bicentennial of Pittsburgh's founding. A reviewer for Keystone Folklore Quarterly described the album, to which two of his children, Gretchen Schmertz Jacob and John Schmertz, contributed, as [...] "tuneful and <b>well-done</b> in the folk tradition". A reviewer for Billboard magazine called it a [...] "fascinating package of songs" [...] that [...] "will appeal to folklorists, educational groups, and, of course, residents of Pittsburgh particularly". Schmertz released his final album, Ladies Beware of an Architect: Songs for Architects and Their Girlfriends, in 1960.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{certainly}} think [...] references {{me a lot}} in her work," [...] Madonna said in the ABC interview. [...] "And sometimes I think it's amusing and flattering and <b>well-done.</b> When I heard [...] on the radio ... I said, 'that sounds very familiar." [...] Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, explaining that she had received an e-mail from Madonna's representatives, who had mentioned their support for [...] "Born This Way". CNN later reported that Madonna's representatives were not aware that the singer, or her team, had sent Gaga an e-mail regarding the situation. AllMusic also note a [...] "striking similarity" [...] between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and Kylie Minogue's 1991 single [...] "What Do I Have to Do", writing that [...] "Kylie Minogue has always displayed a strong Madonna influence—something she’s readily admitted to in interviews." ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{writing for}} Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme {{was worried about}} how much Kira's and Athrun's {{relationship}} would be focused in Gundam SEED, but liked that Lacus Clyne's introduction added tension to it. Ever Cheung from Animefringe who wondered {{about the future of}} Kira and Lacus because the two are about to embrace in the anime's opening sequence. He said, [...] "If that's real, this story may be more interesting than I thought..." [...] Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed Kira's and Athrun's rivalry which resulted in <b>well-done</b> fight scenes from each of their mobile suits. Liversidge praised the development from such rivalry as the two started hating each other and their battle. DVDTalk writer Don Houston considered Kira to be similar to other anime protagonists because he fights for peace and not glory, labeling him the [...] "reluctant hero".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club was very positive towards the episode, writing [...] "'I Am God' {{is probably the}} strangest episode since 'Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner', but unlike that one's somewhat random focus, 'I Am God' is intently pointed at one thing: the bus crash." [...] While wishing that it had come earlier in the season, the reviewer wrote that [...] "its intense style and emotional stakes {{put it on the}} shortlist of best Veronica Mars episodes." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com praised the dream sequences for their beauty, but criticized them for their complexity. [...] "Man, I just could not get enough of the dream-flashbacks in which Veronica talked to the dead students. So beautiful and <b>well-done.</b> On the other hand, my poor brain is starting {{to have a hard time}} keeping all the facts straight." ...|$|E
500|$|The second segment, [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet", {{was written}} by Oakley and Weinstein. It was {{inspired}} by an episode of The Twilight Zone called [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", in which William Shatner's character is inside an airplane watching a gremlin tear apart the wing. Silverman watched the episode to get inspiration for Bart's facial expressions. Oakley {{said there was a}} lot of work put into the design of the gremlin in [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet" [...] to make him scary [...] "within The Simpsons universe". Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was <b>well-done</b> because he looked scary and [...] "yet it looks like a completely organic Simpsons character". Üter, a character from Germany, makes his first appearance on the show in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was [...] "such a perfect stereotype".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{technical}} {{limitations of the}} Nintendo DS compared to other games in the series {{that have been developed}} for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable, Miyokawa described the movement of the idols during performances as [...] "better than expected," [...] and welcomed shots of the audience waving glow sticks. While another reviewer for 4Gamer could not deny the lower visual quality of the performances compared to previous Idolmaster games, the unexpectedly high sound quality of the songs in combination with <b>well-done</b> dance sequences, albeit on a small screen, was considered by this reviewer as [...] "thoroughly enjoyable." [...] Miyokawa also praised the additional gameplay that goes into minutely adjusting an idol's choreography, but described it as extremely difficult to do well. However, the game's overall degree of difficulty compared to previous Idolmaster games is described as having decreased. The songs introduced in Dearly Stars such as [...] "Hello!!" [...] have been called [...] "wonderful".|$|E
500|$|Empires Helen O'Hara defended Disney's claim [...] "that the {{new title}} {{reflects}} the fact that [...] is very much a two-hander, with Mandy Moore's innocent but (inevitably) feisty Rapunzel and Zachary Levi's street-wise yet clueless Flynn sharing the lead". O'Hara went on to argue that both characters [...] "get decent character development too, and base their growing love story on more than a single longing glance". Todd Hertz of Christianity Today observed that [...] "Disney changed the film's title and showcased the swashbuckling Aladdin-meets-Robin-Hood character who replaces the original story's prince", but felt that [...] "Luckily, these marketing moves don't compromise Tangleds phenomenal storytelling or considerable charm. Hertz concluded, [...] "Still, the movie wisely takes a page from Pixar's playbook to fill the movie with so much <b>well-done</b> slapstick humor, action, goofy characters, and genuine fun that boys won't feel like the ads gave them the old bait-and-switch to trick them into a 'girl' movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} moderate praise in some German gaming magazines {{after its}} European release. In Video Games magazine the reviewer praised {{the game as}} being a good action-adventure game in the same style of The Legend of Zelda; {{he notes that the}} need to find hidden items and areas and the top-down perspective closely resemble the Nintendo classic. He appreciated the variety and extras in the game, the various strategies needed to fight bosses, its difficulty, and the <b>well-done</b> graphics. The reviewers from Power Play compared The Guardian Legend to The Legend of Zelda and Life Force. They praised the diverse gameplay and weapons, difficulty, and the mixture of action-adventure and shoot 'em up elements. They criticized the game for lacking battery-backed RAM to save player progress—one of the reviewers said that [...] "the wretched fumbling with the password had long ended"—as well as its lack of challenging puzzles and a high difficulty level in some of the shoot 'em up sections.|$|E
500|$|New Yorks David Edelstein {{called it}} [...] "a shameless but exuberantly <b>well-done</b> caper comedy," [...] and praised the {{performances}} of Stiller, Murphy and Leoni, saying [...] "Ben Stiller...and Eddie Murphy... show off {{two of the best}} fastballs in comedy, and Téa Leoni's best scene as an FBI agent drunk, both sloppy and blunt makes you wish she had more." [...] Emanuel Levy called Tower Heist a [...] "formulaic, haphazardly plotted action comedy... whose best asset is its strong ensemble." [...] Levy said [...] "What makes the picture... work is not its plot, which is overly familiar and utterly implausible, but the socio-psychological dynamics that prevail among the [...]" [...] Levy singled out Stiller as [...] "well cast" [...] and Sidibe as having [...] "some of the picture's best lines," [...] but gave individual praise to Murphy, saying that he [...] "dominates {{the second half of the}} picture," [...] rendering [...] "a joyous performance that recalls his witty, charming, streetwise roles of the 1980s." ...|$|E
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly {{commented on}} the {{original}} news that several characters would be leaving the cast when they graduate, and said, [...] "Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on Friday Night Lights, which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, {{but it was a}} <b>well-done</b> transition. What I loved most was that the new blood didn't try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished: a seamless, realistic transition. The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been Glee strong points, {{which is not to say}} they couldn't be. But the question is: Is Glee looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of Friday Night Lights... or Saved By the Bell: The New Class?" ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{variously}} {{described his}} writing as [...] "forthright," [...] "chatty", and [...] "charming". In a review in The Globe and Mail Brian Brett admires [...] "Suzuki's disarming candour" [...] and labels it [...] "a strange, fascinating book". While Brett's review is positive, {{he calls it}} [...] "clunkily written" [...] and sometimes repetitive. The Edmonton Journal review notes that Suzuki could [...] "charm the socks off the most hardened soul", but {{that many of his}} stories fall flat. The review in the Quill & Quire notes Suzuki [...] "has not written an indulgent autobiography" [...] and that he [...] "is too polite to dish on his enemies". Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Robert Wiersema states that while [...] "his life is an open book... ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." [...] Wiersema calls him [...] "a natural storyteller". The New Zealand Listener review states, [...] "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to get a date... but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince". Several critics find Suzuki's writing on death to be particularly <b>well-done.</b>|$|E
500|$|Opinions on the game's visual style varied. Walton {{called the}} game's visuals [...] "some {{of the best}} ever seen on the Wii", which was echoed to a degree by MacDonald. Castle was {{generally}} positive about the game's aesthetics, citing the water effects as particularly good. Edge was fairly mixed, saying that <b>well-done</b> environmental effects or the world-building through character banter were spoiled by low-quality textures and stilted character animations. Juba praised the character models, but found environments to be [...] "ugly and muddy in comparison"; Fuller, while not actively criticizing them, said that players used to high-definition consoles would be disappointed. GameTrailers found the amount of detail put into environments [...] "remarkable" [...] for the Wii hardware {{despite a lack of}} scale, while Parkin found the visuals generally unimpressive despite a few stand-out moments. Nintendo Power said that the graphics gave the game's setting an [...] "authentic" [...] appearance despite some low-resolution textures, while Eurogamer praised them for their [...] "sepia tone". Frame rate drops during moments of high activity were generally noted by reviewers. Uematsu's incidental scoring also received praise from multiple critics.|$|E
500|$|Ramsey Isler of IGN {{thought there}} was not much {{original}} or <b>well-done</b> about the episode, and negatively compared it to previous episodes of The X-Files. He wrote the [...] "slow...story [...] the intrigue and excitement that other episodes in the series had," [...] but praised its conclusion as a [...] "pay off". John McCracken of TV Guide also compared it to The X-Files, and thought the episode was [...] "tedious" [...] and [...] "largely felt like a by-the-numbers B-movie affair". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad enjoyed the [...] "B-movie" [...] aspects of the plot however, calling them [...] "fun". She thought the episode felt like [...] "a thriller movie," [...] and praised Noble's acting as [...] "brilliantly". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, explaining that [...] "despite some good makeup effects and a few emotional moments, [...] "Johari Window" [...] distressingly average". Andrew Hanson of the LA Times enjoyed how the [...] "Edina hum" [...] remained in the background of every town scene, but missed the [...] "investigation exposition"-supplying presence of Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo). Television Without Pity graded the episode a B-.|$|E
500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first several}} episodes of season three, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine gave the show 3.5/4 stars, and praised it for making a [...] "huge, game-changing step forward". He continued that [...] "Hard science meets soft comedy, {{and the results are}} consistently surprising and rarely disappointing. The solid mythology and high stakes keep the series moving as forward as quickly as FlashForward and The Event, but the dual tones of the two worlds offer considerably more breadth in the stories it tells... captivating television". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised Torv, Noble, and Jackson's performances. He however disliked the new plotline of two Olivias, explaining [...] "It's hard to fault the execution of the first two episodes, which skillfully set up Fringe's two competing universes and two misplaced Olivias... Yet <b>well-done</b> isn't the same as welcome. I'm not giving up on the show, which was one of last year's best. But I don't want to spend weeks watching our Olivia suffer and their Olivia make Walter and Peter suffer. You have to give writers leeway to take you where they want to go — but at a certain point, commercial entertainment has to be entertaining, or there's no reason to watch".|$|E
500|$|Most {{publications}} {{agreed that}} the Wii counterpart of Mario & Sonic had clean textures and <b>well-done</b> animations; N-Europe's Iun Hockley thought that each character was pleasingly rendered, and Thomas added that the graphics were [...] "crisp and colorful". Mark Bozon preferred the remixed Nintendo and Sega music and thought the general Olympic-related music [...] " [...] be a bit generic". GameDaily's Robert Workman called the background music [...] "mostly forgettable". Echoing this sentiment for the DS version, Emily Balistrieri of GamePro thought [...] "most of the music [...] too interesting". Compared to the Wii version, the DS version's visuals are of the same style and its graphics are nearly on the same level. Due to the inability to compete against other players online, Harris regarded Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games limited use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the DS as a [...] "missed opportunity". Many reviewers, including Gibson and Pro-G's James Orry, found the uploading of best times and scores to be a cumbersome process. Although the home console version also has online rankings, it lacks direct competition between players. Disappointed with the aforementioned aspect, Bozon rationalized that the leaderboards [...] "certainly [...] sense for a game like this".|$|E
500|$|SaGa Frontier {{received}} mostly mixed or average {{reviews in}} North America. The game currently holds a 73% on GameRankings. [...] Although many publications disagreed on {{positive aspects of}} the game, much criticism arose from its Free Scenario System. GameSpot called the game a [...] "solid, if not exactly stellar, RPG that'll certainly keep you busy for a while—or at least until you tire of its occasional lack of focus". The website found the combat refreshing {{and many of its}} pre-rendered visuals to be <b>well-done,</b> but had many negative comments, specifically concerning the game's nonlinear nature and unfocused scenarios. IGN proclaimed SaGa Frontier to be [...] "the only bruised apple in Square's current collection of role-playing games", similarly stating that the game's Free Scenario System can become confusing and easily cause the player to become lost. However, it labelled the story and sprite-based graphics its strong points. Game Informer notably found that the plot of SaGa Frontier is more of an outline than a descriptive formula as seen in other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VII and Chrono Trigger: the publication also criticized the game's graphics, but praised its length and gameplay. Staff reviewers at RPGFan and RPGamer agreeably noted the game's battle system to be its highlight; both websites mention that discovering combinations attacks to be [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "exciting".|$|E
500|$|Doll has {{received}} several positive reviews from English-language critics. About.com's Deb Aoki {{placed it on}} her list of recommended horror manga. According to Aoki, Mihara's stories proved to be haunting, despite not following the traditional model of gory horror stories. While finding Mihara's art <b>well-done,</b> yet [...] "not especially memorable", Patrick King of Animefringe wrote that Mihara's focus on the social effects of the Dolls and their environments greatly contributed to {{the appeal of the}} series. Sequential Tarts Sheena McNeil wrote that Doll examines the relationships between androids and people on [...] "a much more serious and realistic level" [...] than Clamp's Chobits. In follow-up reviews, she wrote that the series conveyed [...] "a sense of reality that is unsettling and the stories are harsh reads—being violent and/or tragic." [...] According to her, Doll simultaneously examines the meaning of humanity and modern-day fears surrounding the possibility of such androids. She also wrote that Mihara's [...] "jaw-dropping beautiful" [...] artwork contrasted well with the characters' misery. Jason Thompson, in , wrote that childbirth and family served as the manga's themes. According to him, Mihara's character designs and artwork complemented the stories nicely. Conversely, Anime News Network's Liann Cooper reviewed the hardcover edition of Doll with mixed feelings: according to her, the stories mostly lacked entertainment value, and had artwork that failed to catch the reader's eye, but she praised the presentation. She concluded that the hardcover edition would only appeal to [...] "avid collectors".|$|E
500|$|Gameplay drew {{a variety}} of {{reactions}} from [...] "immersive" [...] and [...] "intriguing", to formulaic. The puzzles were generally considered by critics as challenging and <b>well-done.</b> The duration of the game was considered short, and reviewers criticized the spacing of the save points and absence of checkpoints. The game's adherence to the formula of the Silent Hill series also drew criticism; the opening comment of GameSpot's review remarked that [...] "this old fog needs to learn some new tricks", and further detailed that the game provided [...] "an entirely conventional adventure that relies on eight-year-old franchise hallmarks {{at the expense of}} anything truly new." [...] Some camera issues were noted, especially in tight corridors. Reviewers wrote that Origins had a greater emphasis on combat than previous installments, although reaction to the combat was generally negative. Some reviewers felt that the player was encouraged to avoid combat, due to {{a variety of}} gameplay factors, including the breakable melee weapons. On the other hand, GameSpy's David Chapman stated that the readily available weapons made Travis too powerful. The inclusion of quick time events was not well received by reviewers, who felt that it added nothing appealing to the game. Additionally, the soundtrack was frequently praised as frightening, and a part of the game's appeal. The PlayStation Official Magazine UK wrote: [...] "Despite its small-screen setting, Origins even manages a few genuine scares, mostly thanks to the first-rate sound: this should only be played through headphones." ...|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{scholars}} {{think the}} work is more complicated and important than a cursory read suggests. With the publication of True at First Light critics saw a more humane and empathetic Hemingway, and began to shift their emphasis away from {{the image of the}} [...] "white man with a gun." [...] Robert Fleming considers True at First Light [...] {{to be part of the}} Hemingway canon declaring, [...] "This is a more complicated book than it appears to be, and Hemingway deserves far more credit for it than the reviewers of the popular press have given it. Serious critics dealing with the late works would be advised not to ignore it". Gadjusek praises the prose style, which he says is a new direction in Hemingway's writing; he also believes, despite the editing, the book is cohesive and whole with well-ordered themes. [...] Burwell considers the edits to the manuscript generally <b>well-done,</b> though she laments losses that she thinks contribute to some of the subtexts in the book. Biographer Kenneth Lynn criticized Hemingway's sons for editing the manuscript but of Hemingway he says the [...] "memoirist is being totally, indeed helplessly honest," [...] and Gray concedes the publication of the book [...] "underscores Hemingway's courage as a writer". Despite what he considers poor workmanship in the book, Wood considers Hemingway even at his worst a compelling writer and he says the literary estate should be left alone to save the literary influence.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{although most}} reviewers found {{some of the}} storylines more effective than others. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that [...] "the main portion of this episode was quite funny, even if the ending lacked bite." [...] Similarly, Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly found that the episode was [...] "another strong showing for 30 Rock... although Jenna's plotline was pretty tired." [...] TV Squad's Bob Sassone was similarly positive about [...] "The Bubble", calling it [...] "another good episode." [...] James Poniewozik of Time, also responded favorably to the episode {{with the exception of}} the Jenna storyline, writing that it [...] "was the first one in a long time that I enjoyed almost completely without reservation (Jenna's subplot was off, but it was barely a blip)." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked the bubble concept, reporting, [...] "he idea that attractive people get away with things that the more average-looking can't is an old joke, even on 30 Rock (with Cerie)", but nonetheless enjoyed the [...] "variations" [...] of the joke saying they were [...] "well-conceived". Sepinwall concluded, [...] "this was one of the funniest 30 Rocks of the season. Zap2it's Rick Porter was also favorable to [...] "The Bubble" [...] in his recap, opining that 30 Rock [...] "gave us a very <b>well-done</b> episode". As with Lyons and Poniewozik, Porter felt Jenna's story [...] "didn't really click", but liked the scene with Jenna and her stylist team firing off words to describe Jenna's beauty as [...] "scathingly funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Adam Sessler of X-Play stated: [...] "Whether it's a decade-late {{answer to the}} Marvel vs. Capcom team up games or an off-the-cuff boardroom joke gone wildly too far, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is destined to make just about anyone's shortlist of bizarre video game team-ups. Still, sometimes two disparate things can merge to create a unique synergy that makes the melding work, however unlikely it may have seemed at the outset." [...] In GamePro, Sid Shuman called it [...] "surprisingly enjoyable." [...] Wired.com's preview stated {{that the concept of}} the game was [...] "nose-pokingly ludicrous", noting that Superman's powers could be used to easily defeat a character with the comment, [...] "from Sub-Zero to <b>Well-Done</b> in eight seconds flat." [...] ABC News praised the game's story because it did [...] "a great job of giving players a cohesive, if far-fetched, story line that's fun if not engaging," [...] as well as [...] "comic book-like" [...] dialogue. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universes Kombo Challenge mode was criticized as a thin and frustrating mode with combos that required very precise timing. The modes of Klose Kombat and Free-fall Kombat were praised as concepts but were criticized in their execution as they appeared to slow the gameplay down and took the player out of the fast gameplay experience. Critics noted that the change in the amount of gore was disappointing to longtime fans of the series who were used to the [...] "insane amounts of gore." ...|$|E
