A teaser {{was released by}} Dark Horse Comics for Free Comic Book Day 2015, with Fight Club 2 #1 following in late May of that year. The series explores Joseph Campbell's concept of the 'second father' as being vital to the hero's journey, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has always fascinated Palahniuk.|$|E
25|$|Discovery bay {{has only}} one current sport ground at the moment, the astroturf next to the {{community}} centre located in the north plaza (there is also a pitch located in-between the two Primary schools) <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> the Discovery Bay community feels that they need at the moment. With the amount of space in this area, residents feel that a sports ground is needed. Sport is very popular in Discovery Bay {{with a number of}} sport teams. Recently, there was a protest in the plaza to let Hong Kong Resorts know that everybody wants a sports ground. The government refuses to provide any assistance or land.|$|E
500|$|Critics warmly praised Passport to Pimlico on its release. Several critics {{identified}} that the script was excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that [...] "the chief credit for... joy {{of a film}} should go to T. E. B. Clarke". The unnamed reviewer for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "every line, every 'gag', is a little masterpiece of wit", while the critic C. A. Lejeune, writing for The Observer, thought that the writing and direction were excellent; {{she went on to}} record that [...] "the end comes too soon, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be said of very few films".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} Page explained that in juxtaposition {{to the previous}} Presence album, John Paul Jones was inspired to create new material from his recently purchased Yamaha GX-1 synthesizer, and he was [...] "...working closely with Robert, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had not happened before." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Stephanie,” {{explains}} Tricia “has painted {{this image}} {{that is exactly}} like what Taylor is seeing she’s a woman with conflicts that run so deep; she can’t even quite touch them. It gives her character {{a constant state of}} tension <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> made all her scenes so interesting”.|$|R
25|$|These moves proved successful, {{because after}} {{dropping}} {{the season opener}} to the Wizards, the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and the Phoenix Suns <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> the Mavericks {{had been unable to}} do the last two seasons.|$|R
500|$|Although Arafat lived {{a modest}} lifestyle, Dennis Ross, former Middle East {{negotiator}} for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, stated that Arafat's [...] "walking-around money" [...] financed a vast patronage system known as neopatrimonialism. According to Salam Fayyad—a former World Bank official whom Arafat appointed Finance Minister of the PNA in 2002—Arafat's commodity monopolies could accurately {{be seen as}} gouging his own people, [...] "especially in Gaza which is poorer, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is totally unacceptable and immoral." [...] Fayyad claims that Arafat used $20 million from public funds to pay {{the leadership of the}} PNA security forces (the Preventive Security Service) alone.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} she thought Sarah had {{come to terms with}} the fact she is a lesbian, Batley said: [...] "I don't know because from the beginning, Sarah was always boy crazy, so for her, I don't think it's about being one way or the other — I think she's just very clingy. Batley also gave her views on how Sarah should have to developed, opining it would have been good for her to spend more time on her own, be herself and learn who she really is. She felt that Sarah had to often clung on to people and believing that {{ultimately}} it would make her happy. Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: [...] "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though. Maybe she was more bisexual than anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydia's {{relationships}} {{helped develop}} the character. Her first relationship off-screen is with ex-girlfriend Charlotte, who supposedly shared her interests in music and fashion, as they were both considered 'out there'. The history of the relationship immediately gave viewers an insight to the character. However, their relationship was seemingly shattered by Lydia's constant jealousy and her clingy nature, which ultimately lead to their break up. But, Lydia {{tried to commit suicide}} soon after, which was told on-screen when Charlotte arrived in the village. Lydia's second relationship is a more serious one, with the sexually confused Sarah Barnes; Sarah, who had previously been portrayed as heterosexual, suffers an identity crisis, coming to terms with her one-night stand with Zoe Carpenter, however Sarah ended the relationship after Lydia became interfering and tried to control her life due to falling in love with her. Speaking to entertainment website Digital Spy about Sarah's relationship with Lydia, Loui Batley commented, [...] "With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Sarah liked." [...] After her relationship with Sarah ended, the character's true persona was revealed. She became jealous of Sarah and her relationship with Zoe, and the character's vulnerability became the centre of her deranged campaign for revenge {{in the latter part of}} 2009, as she was excluded from Sarah's life.|$|E
50|$|One afternoon, LaVaughn and Jolly {{are both}} {{watching}} the kids when Jilly chokes on a toy. Jolly does CPR on Jilly, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> she had <b>been</b> studying in her classes recently: Jilly {{is taken to}} hospital. LaVaughn and Jeremy explain to LaVaughn's mom what happened, and she begrudgingly praises Jolly for the first time.|$|R
25|$|The {{club was}} a {{founding}} member of the Football League in 1888–89 and won their first League Championship title in the 1890–91 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in 1914–15. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton <b>were</b> champions, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would again occur in 1939.|$|R
5000|$|... "These are two photos Patti took of me on Cooden Beach on a {{freezing}} windy Winter {{day earlier}} this year the day after I played harp and viola for her at the De La Warr Pavilion.

2500|$|However, {{there were}} some {{complaints}} for the game's limitations of game modes. Critics such as X-Plays reviewer felt that the General Manager mode [...] "does not {{go as far as}} it should--no underhanded options--but it's a great start," [...] while an eToychest reviewer quoted about the Season mode [...] "for the first time through this more visual style of story has a lot going for it, but gameplay is about replayability, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is sorely lacking here due to the limit placed on possible story arcs." ...|$|E
2500|$|To ensure his son's {{success in}} his naval career, the senior Decatur hired a tutor, Talbot Hamilton, a former {{officer of the}} Royal Navy, to {{instruct}} his son in navigational and nautical sciences. While serving aboard United States Decatur received what was the equivalent to formal naval training not only from Hamilton but through active service aboard a commissioned ship, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> distinguished the young midshipman from many of his contemporaries. [...] He also had a talent for drawing ships and designing and building ship models and when time allowed would also pursue this hobby.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{point that}} Wittgenstein makes against the {{possibility}} of a private language involves the beetle-in-a-box thought experiment. He asks the reader to imagine that each person has a box, inside of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> everyone intends to refer to with the word [...] "beetle". Further, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each claims to know what a [...] "beetle" [...] is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word [...] "beetle" [...] could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that each person has something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object [...] "drops out of consideration as irrelevant". Thus, Wittgenstein argues, if we can talk about something, then it is not private, in the sense considered. And, contrapositively, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we cannot talk about it.|$|E
50|$|As seen so far, the {{influence}} and authority in which secret societies had over society was indeed significant. Such power could be wielded various ways, such {{as to be}} used in keeping order, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> the colonial state recognised for an extended period as a benefit of having the secret societies. However, while their power could help maintain order, it also meant that the opposite could happen as well.|$|R
5000|$|Oliver's {{mother always}} {{tried to get him}} to emulate someone [...] "normal" [...] - though she always used Michael Jackson as an example - <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Oliver did not appreciate. Through the years, Oliver's mother had a wall sized Michael Jackson photo {{covering}} Oliver's room, bought him a Michael Jackson glove, a Michael Jackson Caucasian kit and the Michael Jackson facial distorter (basically a tabletop vise for the face).|$|R
50|$|Both Jabłońska and Chmielowski co-founded the Albertine Sisters on 15 January 1891 and he {{appointed}} her on 7 April 1902 as its Superior General - {{this was a}} post that she retained until her death. She made her solemn profession as a nun on 6 March 1897. Jabłońska dedicated her life to aid the poor and those who suffered <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> intensified following her mother's death; {{she had become a}} nund despite the defiance of her protective father.|$|R
2500|$|The series {{begins with}} Rand {{returning}} to New York {{after having been}} missing, presumed dead, for 15 years. Buck said that [...] "a lot of [...] is about a journey of finding self ... {{in terms of what}} he wants to be as far as 'Who is Danny Rand? What is the Iron Fist?’ and then, 'How do these things get together?'" [...] Loeb described the structure of the season as building [...] "through a series of sort of metaphorical fights, which is very important in a martial arts film, to sort of show how the character needs to grow from the innocent, wide-eyed person to someone who has {{to come to terms with}} ‘this is the way the outside world works—how am I going to make it work for me?’ It’s a journey of self, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we haven’t really had a chance to do" [...] in previous Marvel series.|$|E
2500|$|On January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump, in a {{move that}} stood in {{contrast}} to the actions of the Obama administration, signed a presidential memorandum to advance approval of the pipeline construction, while stating his intention to [...] "renegotiate some of the terms" [...] of the pipeline bill. The order would expedite the environmental review that Trump described as an [...] "incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process." [...] These executive orders also outlined how the completion of the pipeline would create more jobs <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Trump and his administration believe is essential and important. They also feel as if the wages that people are being paid should be increased, another factor of the continued completion of the pipeline that the administration feels would be beneficial. The fast change of pace is what led to the clashes and resulting arrests of those who were residing on the land in order to continue the protesting of a pipeline. The actual purpose of the orders signed by Trump was to counteract the denial by the USACE to continue the pipeline being built, which was originally issued in November 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Matra {{describes}} Himari's {{appearance on}} the cover of the first volume as the [...] "first he had ever done". In order to attract readers, Matra stated that he drew Himari in a way that was unusual for her character. He described her smile as [...] "gentle" [...] <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would never be seen in the story itself. Himari first appears in chapter one of the manga [...] "The Cat, The Girl, and The Allergy". After saving Yuto from an ayakashi, she later introduces herself to him and explains that he comes from a family of demon slayers. She goes on to say that at some point one of the members of his family spared and tamed one of her ancestors, choosing compassion rather than reward, and as a result she vows to protect him. Himari soon takes on the last name [...] "Noihara" [...] in order to blend in more, Yuto comments that the name is the area from where his grandparents were from. Aside from the ancestor reasoning, Himari shows strong feelings towards Yuta, asking him out on a date and letting him choose her clothing among other things. It is later revealed that Himari was an important person to Yuto during his childhood which helps their relationship grow.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 {{the band}} {{were given a}} five album record deal with B-Unique Records, {{distributed}} by Columbia Records in the United States and Polydor Records everywhere else.

50|$|The most novel {{part of the}} {{conception}} of the exchange design {{was the use of}} pulse amplitude modulation and time division multiplex techniques for the transmission of up to 100 conversations over a common channel, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> well ahead of its time. This technique would eventually be used in System X and other digital exchanges as technology caught up. Another interesting feature of the installation was the use of time-sharing in the setting-up of the calls and in their control, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> all subsequent digital exchange design would follow.|$|R
5000|$|On January 24, 2010, the New York Times {{published}} a specially-constructed [...] "Fold-In" [...] crossword. The fully completed puzzle could be folded in the Jaffee style to reveal six further solutions, each of <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> could itself <b>be</b> folded (e.g. LAWN CHAIR, NEWSPAPER, POKER HAND and ORIGAMI). Also mimicking Mads design, {{the top and}} bottom rows of the crossword both featured an [...] "A" [...] and a [...] "B" [...] in their horizontal grids, <b>which</b> needed to <b>be</b> folded together to touch one another to produce the desired result.|$|R

50|$|After touring for {{the album}} Days was finished, in late 2012 Real Estate took a break. While guitarist Mondanile and bassist Alex Bleeker worked on their {{respective}} solo projects, lead singer and guitarist Martin Courtney {{got married and}} was busy writing songs, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> he had started while touring. The band then spent winter and spring working on songs, taking up a total of eight to nine months on songwriting before recording commenced.

The actor also believes that if Clark could see the darkness that Lex is constantly fighting then he would understand more of Lex's actions. Reviewer Brian Byun expressed that the choice to explore the friendship between Clark and Lex, before they become sworn enemies, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> {{used in the past}} but never to the depth of what Smallville is doing, helped keep the show from becoming [...] "Dawson's Creek with superpowers".|$|R
50|$|Early in 1954 the Ford Taunus finally {{received}} the 1500 cc engine {{that had been}} planned for successive Taunus models ever since 1939. Hitherto the Ford Taunus 12M had competed as a large (if rather underpowered) car in the sector increasingly led by the Volkswagen Beetle. Its size had always invited comparison with larger cars such as the Opel Olympia Rekord, the Borgward Isabella, the Fiat 1400 and the Peugeot 403. What these cars had in common, however, was an engine of approximately 1500 cc, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> till now the Taunus had conspicuously lacked.|$|R
