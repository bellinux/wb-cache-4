Objective: A <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> survey (WTS), {{conducted}} in 2007 at 94 % of clinics in Cape Town, measured length of patient <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> (WT) for services and provided recommendations to shorten <b>waiting</b> <b>times.</b> Whether subsequent implementation of these recommendations occurred was unknown, hence a {{study was conducted}} {{to assess the impact of}} the previous <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> survey recommendations on stimulating efforts to reduce <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> and whether <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> had reduced. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study design assessed the perceptions of 92 % of clinic managers in Cape Town, regarding the 2007 survey, while a before and after study design assessed changes in <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> between 2007 and 2011, using a random sample of 22 clinics. Results: The overall median <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> of all clinics in the sample decreased by 21 minutes in 2011 (95 % CI 11. 77 - 30. 23), a 28 % decrease from 2007. This reduction was manifest at individual clinic level as well, with 55 % of clinics reducing their median <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> by at least 15 minutes. No specific factors, including whether recommendations to reduce <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were implemented, were associated with decreases in <b>waiting</b> <b>times.</b> Implementation of recommendations to reduce <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> was 2. 67 times (95 % CI 1. 33 - 5. 40) more likely amongst those who received written recommendations and 2. 3 times) 95 % CI 1. 28 - 4. 19) more likely amongst managers with 5 or more years' experience.

40|$|Objectives. To assess <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> {{for three}} groups of {{orthopaedic}} patients in Sweden and to identify factors explaining variations in <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Also examined were factors associated with patients' perceptions that <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were too long. Design. Retrospective study. Setting and study participants. Patients from orthopaedic units at 10 Swedish hospitals participated in the study. A questionnaire was sent to 1336 surgical patients (517 hip replacement, 321 back surgery, and 498 arthroscopic knee surgery) 3 months after surgery. Information extracted from the hospitals' patient administrative systems was also used. Outcome measures. Length of <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> socio-economic variables, hospital type, health-related quality of life, and opinion about <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> The data were analysed mainly using regression analyses. Results. The overall response rate was 79 %. In all pre-operative stages, <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were longest in the hip replacement group. Socio-economic variables were not consistent determinants of variation in <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> except for working status in the back surgery group where. working patients had shorter <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> than non-working patients irrespective of phase of <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Admission to a county/district county hospital, compared with a university/regional hospital, was associated with shorter <b>time</b> on the <b>waiting</b> fist. Patients with better health-related quality of life had significantly longer <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for arthroscopic knee surgery by all <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> measures. The length of wait {{was a significant predictor}} of the patients' acceptance of <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Patients' influence over the date of surgery also appeared to affect their opinion about the <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Conclusions.

40|$|Objectives: In Spain, {{official}} information on <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for surgery {{is based on}} the interval between the indication for surgery and its performance. We aimed to estimate total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for surgical procedures, including outpatient visits and diagnostic tests prior to surgery. In addition, we propose an alternative system to manage total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> that reduces variability and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> without increasing the use of health care resources. This system is illustrated by three surgical procedures: cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair. Methods: Using data from two Autonomous Communities, we adjusted, through simulation, a theoretical distribution of the total <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> assuming independence of the <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> of each stage of the clinical procedure. We show an alternative system in which the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> for the second consultation is established according to the <b>time</b> previously <b>waited</b> for the first consultation. Results: Average total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair were 331, 355 and 137 days, respectively (official data are 83, 68 and 73 days, respectively). Using different negative correlations between <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for subsequent consultations would reduce maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> by between 2 % and 15 % and substantially reduce heterogeneity among patients, without generating higher resource use. Conclusion: Total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> are between two and five times higher than those officially published. The relationship between the <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> at each stage of the medical procedure may be used to decrease variability and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
