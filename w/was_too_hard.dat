25|$|During {{its early}} years of operation, the field at the Metrodome was {{surfaced}} with SuperTurf. The surface, also known as SporTurf, was very bouncy—so bouncy, in fact, that Billy Martin once protested a game after seeing a base hit that would normally be a pop single turn into a ground rule double. Baseball and football players alike complained that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vincenzo Galilei thought {{highly of}} Bardi, and {{dedicated}} his famous Dialogo della musica antica et della moderna to him. In the Dialogo, Galilei condemns polyphony, praises monody, and expresses the {{wish that the}} musical practice of the ancient Greeks would be restored; corrupt and incomprehensible contemporary music would be replaced with an idealized version of the supposed music of the ancient time. Ironically, the Counter-Reformation Council of Trent had just finished condemning polyphonic practice, for the same supposed fault (it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to understand the sung text), but for spiritual rather than secular reasons.|$|E
25|$|Driver {{support was}} lacking {{due to the}} {{increased}} programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line {{all the way through}} Windows 2000. Programmers complained that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to write drivers for NT, and hardware developers were not going to go through the trouble of developing drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, more expensive machines.|$|E

25|$|The {{only one}} who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by {{deepening}} the things which Cézanne wanted to do, but it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.|$|E
25|$|The British {{held out}} in their {{makeshift}} fort for three weeks with little water and food supplies. Many {{died as a result}} of sunstroke and lack of water. As the ground <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to dig graves, the British would pile the dead bodies of their killed outside the buildings, and drag and dump them inside a dried well during the night. The lack of sanitation facilities led to spread of diseases such as dysentery and cholera, further weakening the defenders. There was also a small outbreak of smallpox, although this was relatively confined.|$|E
25|$|The {{first game}} was held Thanksgiving Day in 1933, an {{exhibition}} contest against the Rochester Arpeakos. A crowd of 10,000 attended {{the game to}} watch Conacher play his first competitive football game in Canada in ten years. He did not disappoint, scoring two touchdowns and setting up a third for the Chefs, and was hailed as the game's star despite an 18–15 loss. Toronto lost a return match in Rochester, but {{in the third and}} final game of their season, the Chefs defeated a team from Buffalo at Toronto by a score of 18–0. Conacher was again the star, rushing for two touchdowns and scoring 13 of his team's points. He organized the team for a second year in 1934, known as the Wrigley Aromints due to new sponsorship, and again played an exhibition schedule as the team remained unaffiliated with any league. The team again played three games, winning all three. However, at the age of 34 years, Conacher found that the game <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> on his body physically, and neither he nor his team returned for a third season.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008 Bob Bindschadler (NASA) {{landed on}} the {{floating}} ice shelf of PIG, this is at the downstream end where it floats on the sea. This landing, by a Twin Otter plane fitted with skis, was the first ever landing on this ice shelf. The reason for landing on the ice shelf was for a reconnaissance mission to investigate the feasibility of drilling through around [...] of ice, to lower instruments into the ocean cavity below. It is hoped that this will provide important information on {{the link between the}} ocean and Pine Island Glacier. It was decided that the small crevasse free area <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> for further landings and so further fieldwork had to be postponed. Therefore, two GPS units and a weather station were positioned as near as possible to PIG.|$|E

[...] She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own selfishness in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out. She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be [...] "mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples." ...|$|E
500|$|Another Hemingway scholar, Jim Berloon, {{disagrees with}} Tetlow, writing that its only unity {{consists}} of similarities in tone and {{style and the}} recurrence of the Nick Adams character. Although the first vignettes share a common thread about the war, each is distinctly framed, weakening any structural unity that might have existed. He blames the war, saying that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> for Hemingway {{to write about it}} cohesively, that it was [...] "too large, terrible, and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety". Instead, he says, Hemingway wrote fragments, [...] "discrete glimpses into hell... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night." [...] The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters, shattering the carefully constructed order. The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers, only referred to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings, where danger exists overtly, on the battlefield, or, in one case, by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi.|$|E
500|$|Second-term U.S Representative Joe Sestak, {{a former}} U.S. Navy admiral, began privately {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} seeking the Democratic nomination {{with his family in}} December 2008. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, approached Sestak in April 2009 and asked him to run, but Sestak claimed he was not initially interested. Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day [...] Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to [...] "wait and see". During a May 3 appearance on CNN's State of the Union with John King, Sestak questioned whether Specter was really a genuine Democrat, adding, [...] "I think Arlen has to tell us not that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to run against someone. ...

500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard.</b> I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E
500|$|Webb felt a {{responsibility}} to reinvent Spider-Man. One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics. In February 2011, with {{the launch of the}} official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed. Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and [...] noted [...] "the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands {{as one of the great}} comic-book costumes ever." [...] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine. Webb explained that he felt that [...] "the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect". Webb paid attention to the question of [...] "How would a kid make it?" [...] and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew [...] "wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [...] were something we used to emphasize that." [...] He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little darker. Webb stated that [...] "With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made". Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.|$|E
