5|$|A {{total of}} 162,099 Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in April and May, 1925, with 99 pieces {{set aside for}} {{inspection}} and testing by the 1926 Assay Commission. The coins <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> blanks, or planchets, that had been intended for mintage into 1924 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars, but had not been used.|$|E
5|$|A two-week work-in {{was held}} at the end of July and {{beginning}} of August 1980. Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections.|$|E
5|$|Boxleiter {{spoke at}} the 2012 Game Developers Conference Indie Soapbox on how indie stars <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> hard work and not from the Independent Games Festival. He added that winning an award at the festival for Solipskier was an {{insignificant}} aspect of his career.|$|E

5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} {{demonstrated a}} rich and nuanced use of color. She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of the}} woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
5|$|Long {{took the}} lead in {{preparing}} the explosives, telling his followers that his experience as a fortuneteller, mystic and natural healer made him an expert. The bombs <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> cannon shot, carbon, sulphur and saltpeter, which were then wrapped together.|$|E
5|$|Lumber thus {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} reeds <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> {{stalks of}} the Giant Reed Arundo donax, called [...] "canna marina" [...] in Italian.

5|$|Sarah Trost was {{the costume}} {{designer}} for The FP; she designed the costumes using fashions local to Frazier Park as her first influence. She was also {{inspired by the}} fashions of Elvis Presley, and the films Double Dragon, Rocky, Mad Max, The Warriors, 8 Mile, Escape from New York, X-Men, {{as well as the}} works of John Carpenter. Trost based the opposing gangs' outfits on American military uniforms of the American Civil War era. The 245's outfits were based on the uniforms of the Confederate Army, while the 248's outfits were based on those of the Union Army. The flags of the gangs were also based on those of the Confederacy and the Union. Trost designed the 245 costumes to look clean and the 248 costume to appear gritty. Most of the costumes <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> materials available to the crew; L Dubba E's costumes <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> jumpsuits. The boots worn by JTRO and BTRO were snow expedition boots. Most of the base clothing came from thrift stores, Sarah Trost's fabric storage, and the Trost's childhood clothing.|$|E

The simple buttstock <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> steel wire and folds {{to the left}} side of gun.|$|R
5|$|The A Station's {{control room}} was given many Art Deco {{fittings}} by architect Halliday. Italian marble {{was used in}} the turbine hall, and polished parquet floors and wrought-iron staircases were used throughout. Owing to a lack of available money following the Second World War, the interior of the B Station was not given the same treatment, and instead the fittings <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E
5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6seconds, but {{it is possible that the}} unconfirmed flerovium-290 with one extra neutron may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 19seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these farthest reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.|$|E
50|$|Slugs <b>are</b> usually <b>made</b> <b>from</b> metals differing {{from those}} of real coins. While genuine coins in the United States {{currency}} <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> various alloys of copper, nickel, and zinc, Canadian coins <b>are</b> <b>made</b> mostly <b>from</b> steel with some copper and nickel, and euro coins <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> steel, nickel, and brass, slugs <b>are</b> frequently <b>made</b> <b>from</b> differing metals and alloys that are cheaper to obtain and mold, such as aluminum, tin, and lead.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of beating sticks (chae), namely gungchae and yeolchae. The gungchae is shaped like a mallet with a round head. The handle <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> bamboo root, boiled and {{straightened}} out and the head <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> hardwood such as birch or antler. Modern gungchae may also <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> plastic; this variety is normally used by beginning musicians. The yeolchae <b>is</b> always <b>made</b> <b>from</b> bamboo.|$|R
5|$|Additional collections, then still {{believed}} to be T.toomansis, <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> South Australia in 1952, again on dead cones of unspecified Banksia, and also in 1956 on dead cones of Banksia marginata. In 1957 and 1958, R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species, and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves, who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis, transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia (family Sclerotiniaceae). Encoelia species are small, tough, brownish discomycetes that typically grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates. Because the original collections were incomplete and certain microscopic features inadequately described, various collections made from Australia were presumed to be variations of the original 1887 collection.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Norway re-established {{operations}} at Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, while the Soviet Union established mining in Barentsburg, Pyramiden and Grumant. The mine at Ny-Ålesund had several fatal accidents, killing 71 people {{while it was}} in operation from 1945 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1963. The Kings Bay Affair, caused by the 1962 accident killing 21 workers, forced Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet to resign. From 1964, Ny-Ålesund became a research outpost, and a facility for the European Space Research Organisation. Petroleum test drilling was started in 1963 and continued until 1984, but no commercially viable fields were found. From 1960, regular charter flights <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the mainland to a field at Hotellneset; in 1975, Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened, allowing year-round services.|$|E
5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Each block {{had access}} to courtyards, known as airing courts, and the asylum was {{surrounded}} by extensive grounds. At {{the end of each}} courtyard were stone rooms used to house incontinent patients, who slept on straw beds. All buildings <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> stone and iron, avoiding the use of wood because of the potential fire hazard. Hot and cold plunge baths were also included, as Fox saw their use as an important part of treatment, which may have been related to his Quaker beliefs and John Wesley's advocacy of the practice. The total construction cost around £35,000. In addition to the wealthy private patients, paupers funded by parish funds were also admitted and kept in accommodation furthest from the central block, which was for the highest in society.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, many {{claims of}} the {{discovery}} of nobelium <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> laboratories in Sweden, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Although the Swedish scientists soon retracted their claims, the priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) credited the Soviet team with the discovery, but retained nobelium, the Swedish proposal, as the name of the element due to its long-standing use in the literature.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many {{claims of}} the {{synthesis}} of lawrencium of varying quality <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> laboratories in the Soviet Union and the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and while the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery, this was reevaluated in 1997, giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element's name.|$|E
