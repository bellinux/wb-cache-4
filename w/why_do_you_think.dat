2500|$|Senator Kerry, we {{have been}} {{fortunate}} {{that there have been}} no further terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> this is? And if elected, what will you do to assure our safety? ...|$|E
2500|$|Pisemsky {{remembered his}} mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman. [...] "Except for those clever eyes of hers, she wasn't good-looking, and once, when I was a student, my father asked me: 'Tell me Aleksey, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> your mother becomes more {{attractive}} with age?' – 'Because {{she has a lot}} of inner beauty which, as years go by, becomes more and more evident', I answered, and he had to agree with me," [...] Pisemsky later wrote. His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel Masons) and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in People of the Forties), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy.|$|E
2500|$|Qiao Zhou asked Du Qiong, [...] "Zhou Shu {{once said}} that the 'something tall on the road' [...] refers {{to the state of}} Wei. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it is so?" [...] Du Qiong replied, [...] "Wei (魏) also refers to either of the two viewing towers at each gate of the {{imperial}} palace. It faces the road and stands out as a very tall structure from a distance away. (Because Wei was also the name of an ancient state,) the sages decided {{to use it as a}} double entendre." [...] When Qiao Zhou sought clarification, Du Qiong further explained, [...] "The term cao (曹) was never used to refer to the positions held by government officials in ancient times. This practice only started in the Han dynasty: clerks are called shu cao (屬曹) and guards are called shi cao (侍曹). This is probably Heaven's will." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Guy, {{if it is}} not impertinent to ask, I <b>do</b> wish <b>you</b> {{would tell}} me one thing. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it wrong to go to that ball?' said Amy, timidly.|$|R
6000|$|Tasso {{stretched}} out her legs, warming {{her feet in}} the heat of the fire. [...] "It surprised me that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not seem to understand, after he killed Rudi. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> him mad, sir?' {{said his}} master, {{speaking}} in a peevish tone. 'Don't use that word too freely. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> him mad?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You foolish child!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{believe that}} you have been worrying. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so much about other people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cyril {{started back}} astonished. [...] "Oh, Elma, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so?" [...] he cried in amazement. [...] "What {{possible}} reason {{can you have}} for saying so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so? How {{often have}} I asked {{you for your}} grounds for such a conviction! There are none. The man of the age is clearly the Duke, the saviour of Europe, in the {{perfection}} of manhood, and with an iron constitution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, Bishop? How could <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{of making}} such a {{creature}} as that Dean of Barchester? Dean of Barchester! I suppose he'll {{be looking for a}} bishopric some of these days--a man that hardly knows who his own father was; a man that I found without bread to his mouth or a coat to his back. Dean of Barchester, indeed! I'll dean him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{find you}} vastly entertaining," [...] said he. [...] "Pray {{continue}} your conversation. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that I {{will give you}} so large a sum of money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MINNIE. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that now? What changed you? Just because I {{might have}} helped to keep Mr. Pindar from being shot by a crazy man--that didn't change you, did it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That! <b>Why,</b> who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would trouble himself {{about my}} 'arnin's. It's {{the big fish}} only that folks talk about, and care about, in such matters." ...|$|R

5000|$|When Boomtown ended, Trailer briefly put his Western costume {{aside and}} hosted Earth Lab, a {{syndicated}} science series that aired {{across the country}} until 1979. He {{was part of the}} successful [...] "I Love New York" [...] tourism campaign, playing a New Hampshire fisherman in a 1982 TV commercial. Trailer had a minor but memorable role as a doctor in the 1990 Cher/Winona Ryder movie Mermaids, saying to Ryder's character, [...] "Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> were pregnant? You're still a virgin!" [...] Later, he co-hosted Boomtown Revisited on Continental Cablevision in the early 1990s.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come back TO LONDON?" [...] he cried, {{with a face}} {{of white}} panic. Hitherto he had seemed to me rather {{relieved}} in expression than otherwise; his countenance had lost its worn and anxious look; {{he was no longer}} watching each moment over his children's safety. [...] "Come back... TO LONDON... and face my trial! <b>Why,</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Hubert, 'twas the court or the hanging I was shirking? No, no; not that; but IT--the red horror! I must get away from IT to the sea--to the water--to wash away the stain--as far from IT--that red pool--as possible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You like it, then? But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it is yours, my lass?" [...] asked Dr. Alec, as he {{sat down}} looking well pleased, and drew his excited little niece to his knee.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I saw {{her to her}} hotel. The same that Mr Dorrit was at. Miss Dorrit {{walked all}} the way, and talked to me so kind, it quite knocked me over. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she walked instead of riding?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she owed}} me some civility. Instead of that, she has treated me {{with nothing but}} insolence. And <b>why,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> It is all because I would not allow her to take that poor, insane young woman to Portray Castle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{did he tell}} me? <b>why,</b> what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Judith; {{he told me that}} he couldn't read! Only {{think of}} that! a white man, and not know how to read his Bible even! He never could have had a mother, sister!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Prisoner or not prisoner," [...] {{the other}} said obstinately, [...] "that is the marquis. <b>Why,</b> man, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{one could be}} mistaken in his own colonel?--a good officer, too; rather strict perhaps, but a good soldier, and a lion to fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's not it, that's not it," [...] said Christian, quickly. [...] "Repentance is not enough. <b>Why,</b> man, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if I went to England just now, {{and said}} ever so earnestly or so truly, `I repent,' that I'd escape {{swinging}} at the yard-arm?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true enough," [...] he said, going {{before us}} with the lantern, [...] "that they call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery. And <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But, my dear Mr. Grey, {{you would}} not have used the word without some meaning. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it {{impossible}}? impossible is such a peculiar word." [...] And here the Marquess looked up with great earnestness to a portrait of himself, which hung over the fire-place. It was one of Sir Thomas's happiest efforts; but it was not the happiness of the likeness, or the beauty of the painting, which now attracted his Lordship's attention; he thought only of the costume in which he appeared in that portrait: the court dress of a Cabinet Minister. [...] "Impossible, Mr. Grey, you must confess, is a very peculiar word," [...] reiterated his Lordship.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{speak of}} Doña Petrona's side-saddle, Antonio?" [...] said the little wife. [...] "She would {{sell it for}} what it cost--perhaps for eight dollars.

6000|$|... "Well done, field-marshal!"
