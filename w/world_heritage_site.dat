40|$|This bachelor´s {{thesis is}} focused on German and Russian UNESCO <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Sites</b> which have been inscribed on the UNESCO <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> List since 2004 and it {{concentrates}} primarily on their connection with tourism. The connection with tourism is evaluated via various attendance statistics, a transportation accessibility, an entrance fee, a type of promotion, a quality and a quantity of accompanying programs and services provided by the UNESCO <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Sites.</b> Afterwards there is a comparison between a touristic attractiveness of the German UNESCO <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Sites</b> and a touristic attractiveness of the Russian UNESCO <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Sites</b> in the thesis. A processing and an evaluation of discovered data, statistics and of a method of the comparison between Germany and Russia enable to determine {{at the end of}} the thesis which of the inscribed <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Sites</b> in Germany and in Russia since 2004 show the biggest connection with tourism and whether Germany or Russia meets more potentials for tourism development from the point of view of the newly inscribed UNESCO <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Sites...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a part of the <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Site.</b> The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Site</b> group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the mission of Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise {{is not part of the}} <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Site</b> group. In 1755 the mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> <b>Site</b> missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E
