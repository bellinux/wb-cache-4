40|$|Abstract. The {{focus of}} this work is to {{simulate}} and optimize thermal comfort in a ship air-conditioning system by evaluating the performance {{of different types of}} air <b>supply</b> <b>outlets.</b> Thermal comfort analyses were performed in Solidworks Flow Simulation software by changing the number, type and position of air <b>supply</b> <b>outlets</b> and the comfort was optimized by evaluating the values of temperature, velocity, PMV (Predicted mean vote) & PPD (Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied). It was concluded from the results obtained from different analyses that air <b>supply</b> <b>outlet</b> is a vital part in any type of HVAC (Heating ventilation & air conditioning) system design, as its number, type and position has significant effect on the air distribution and thermal comfort in a subject space. It was also deduced that improper selection of air <b>supply</b> <b>outlet</b> can result in room air stagnation, unacceptable temperature gradients, and undesirable velocities in the occupied zone that may lead to occupant discomfort. Through this work the importance and effectiveness of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) design tools, in the design & optimization of HVAC systems has been evaluated and it was concluded that CFD design software like Solidworks flow simulation provide an excellent provision to validate different aspects of HVAC design before actual construction...|$|R

DV systems deliver cool {{air into the}} conditioned space {{at or near the}} floor level and return air at the ceiling level. This works by utilizing the natural buoyancy of warm air and the thermal plumes generated by heat sources as cooler air is delivered from lower elevations.

The major practical differences are that in UFAD, air is supplied at a higher velocity through smaller-size <b>supply</b> <b>outlets</b> than in DV, and the <b>supply</b> <b>outlets</b> are usually controlled by the occupants.|$|R

40|$|This Strategy Guideline {{discusses}} {{the benefits and}} challenges of using a compact air distribution system to handle the reduced loads and reduced air volume needed to condition the space within an energy efficient home. Traditional systems sized by 'rule of thumb' (i. e., 1 ton of cooling per 400 ft 2 of floor space) that 'wash' the exterior walls with conditioned air from floor registers cannot provide appropriate air mixing and moisture removal in low-load homes. A compact air distribution system locates the HVAC equipment centrally with shorter ducts run to interior walls, and ceiling <b>supply</b> <b>outlets</b> throw the air toward the exterior walls along the ceiling plane; alternatively, high sidewall <b>supply</b> <b>outlets</b> throw the air toward the exterior walls. Potential drawbacks include resistance from installing contractors or code officials who are unfamiliar with compact air distribution systems, {{as well as a}} lack of availability of low-cost high sidewall or ceiling <b>supply</b> <b>outlets</b> to meet the low air volumes with good throw characteristics. The decision criteria for a compact air distribution system must be determined early in the whole-house design process, considering both supply and return air design. However, careful installation of a compact air distribution system can result in lower material costs from smaller equipment, shorter duct runs, and fewer outlets; increased installation efficiencies, including ease of fitting the system into conditioned space; lower loads on a better balanced HVAC system, and overall improved energy efficiency of the home...|$|R

In comparison with the rectangular air <b>supply</b> <b>outlet,</b> the circular one had lower decay, longer jet distance and better contractibility.

40|$|Because of the {{increased}} expectations on thermal comfort and indoor air quality in sleeping environments at a low energy consumption, {{it is necessary to}} develop new air conditioning systems applied to sleeping environments. In recent years, a large number of studies on task/ambient air conditioning (TAC) have been carried out due to its excellent ventilation and energy saving performance. However, compared to full volume air conditioning (FAC), there exists an inadequacy on thermal control for TAC because cooled air is directly delivered to the space around a human body. Hence, the TAC and FAC systems have their own pros and cons in aspects of thermal, ventilation and energy saving performances, and the position of a <b>supply</b> <b>outlet</b> in an air conditioning (A/C) system significantly influences its operating performances. Therefore, a study on the performance evaluations of an A/C system installed in an experimental bedroom with its <b>supply</b> <b>outlet</b> positioned at five different heights has been carried out, and the study results are presented in this paper. The study results suggested that overall speaking, the A/C system performed the best at a supply air temperature of 23 degrees C, an air flow rate of 50 Lis and a fresh air flow rate of 13 L/s at H 1100 setting, among all study cases.

40|$|Utilizing {{raised floor}} system to {{facilitate}} cable management becomes {{a trend in}} modern intelligent buildings. Underfloor ventilation systems, which {{make use of the}} sub-floor plenum below the raised floor for conditioned air distribution, are also gaining popularity. The ductless operating principle of the underfloor ventilation system enhances space flexibility. Supplying conditioned air from the floor level also inherents advantages in improving indoor air quality and energy saving. Two types of the underfloor ventilation systems are commonly found including the top-level return type (TR) and the floor-level return type (FR). Thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects of both the TR and the FR. underfloor systems were experimentally investigated in the present study. The most commonly used straight vane type floor supply diffusers were used in the experiments. The performance of traditional ceiling-based system with widely adopted 4 -way spread type supply diffusers was also determined under the same conditions for comparison purpose. A controlled experimental room was developed to facilitate the experiments. High risk of draught was observed near the <b>supply</b> <b>outlet</b> of the underfloor ventilation systems. However, draught discomfort can be reduced by the underfloor system compared to the ceiling based system. Similar to the traditional ceiling based system, vertical temperature differences in the occupied region were lower than 3 °C under all the tested conditions for the TR system. Temperature variations higher than the international comfort standards were observed with the FR system when Archimedes number (Ar) was higher than 0. 03. Lower Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values were resulted with both types of underfloor ventilation systems compared to the ceiling-based one. Lower cooling effect should be provided when using the underfloor systems to avoid overcooling to the occupants. The age of air experiments showed that the ceiling-based system maintained a uniform distribution of ventilation in the space. Compared to the ceiling-based system, improvements in ventilation were achieved with the use of TR or FR system in regions near the floor <b>supply</b> <b>outlet.</b> In spaces that were far away from the floor <b>supply</b> <b>outlet,</b> the ventilation performance of the FR system deteriorated. The performance of the TR system was found similar to the ceiling based system at far distance. The TR system was the most efficient one in removing smoke particles inside the whole room. The FR system removed particles in {{the lower part of the}} room better than the ceiling-based system. Improvements in particle concentration in the sitting person breathing level were achieved by the FR system...|$|R
