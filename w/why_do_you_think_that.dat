COX: One aspect {{of it is that}} it forces us to say what it is that we really want to know when we analyze a situation statistically.

A second sample of eligible patients with SLE was recruited from {{four of the six}} practices. Just prior to the face-to-face interviews, patients completed paper versions of the PROs, formatted to look like electronic screen shots, as future administration of the tools using an electronic device (ePRO) is planned. CD interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide developed for the study, with questions such as, ‘Looking at question 1 (feeling tired or lacking energy), how do you define feeling tired? What about lacking energy? What is the difference between these terms? Why would you say that? Do you think we need to include both terms or would you delete one? (If delete one), Which would you omit? Why? Do you have any other suggestions about how this question could be revised? If yes, please describe. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is clearer?’ All patients (with the exception of one) were asked about both PROs, but they were not asked to evaluate every item; the items perceived to be the most challenging were tested and to avoid the interviews becoming tedious for the patients, they were not asked to evaluate questions that were very similar to each other. Multiple rounds of CD interviews were conducted. After each round of interviews, the responses were reviewed and the PROs were modified accordingly. The revised drafts were then used in the next round of interviews.|$|E
40|$|Increase supply or manage demand? CUE: Both India and South Africa have {{legislation}} {{to ensure that}} drinking water has the highest priority in the allocation of scarce water resources. However, while South Africa has received international praise for her recent legislation on water rights, in India that legislation is often so complex that it cannot be enforced. Charles Batchelor is a hydrologist {{who has been working}} on a joint Indian/South African project to see what the two countries can learn from each other. He believes that if people in dryland areas are to have reliable access to water, water projects will need to change their focus from increasing supply to better management, or allocation, of the available water, so that priority needs, such as for drinking, are met. Mike Davison spoke to Charles at his home in the UK, and began by asking him about the new laws protecting drinking water supplies in South Africa. IN:		?What has happened in the last? OUT:		?rights to water are protected? DUR?N	 4 ? 32 ?? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Charles Batchelor explaining how the traditional Indian concept of water as a community resource {{has been replaced by a}} system of private wells, so restricting the access of poorer people to water. Transcript Batchelor	What has happened in the last two years is that the government of South Africa has developed really impressive and innovative legislation that certainly has some potential to protect the drinking water supplies for people in South Africa. Davison	What legislative steps have they taken? Batchelor	Basically de-linking the ownership of water from land such that now people that own land no longer have automatic rights to the groundwater under that land or the rights to surface water flowing through that land. In addition they have set up an institutional approach that ensures that groundwater reserves or surface water reserves are protected for drinking water. In fact drinking water and the environment have first use on available water resources. Davison	In India also the Government would say that providing safe, clean drinking water is their highest priority in terms of water availability and use. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> has not actually meant that there is enough clean, safe drinking water for people in dryland areas in India? Batchelor	It?s partly because the legislation is quite complicated but also, it?s very difficult for the government departments to actually enforce or police the legislation in the different states. Davison	So if a community living in India in a dryland area wanted to ensure a better availability of water for domestic purposes what practical steps could they take do you think? Batchelor	Currently what tends to happen is they?re likely to become part of a Watershed Development Programme. Currently these programmes tend to put emphasis on increasing the supply of water in an area. Generally trying to develop additional water resources by rain fall harvesting, soil and water conservation, maybe by rehabilitating tanks or reservoirs in that village area. But the simple fact is that the current approach for putting emphasis on supply is not working as well as it might and I think most people are beginning to realise that much more emphasis has to go on managing demand. And I think in the future the emphasis will be on developing institutions in villages that look at managing the water resources in those villages so that it goes to the priority uses, drinking water being the most important use in a village area. Davison	So often it?s a water management committee that?s making decisions about how water should be allocated for different uses. How are the members of the committee chosen? Batchelor	Under the Government of India?s Watershed Development Programme there are guidelines on how committees should be set up. The committees should be linked to the local government system. In practice of course in many areas the committees are dominated by the more powerful social groupings in villages. In many cases these are the land owners in those villages and decisions that are made by these committees tend to be biased towards the use of water for irrigation rather than for drinking water supply. There?s not an integrated approach being taken to managing water in villages such that democratically elected institutions are set up that ensure that the rights to drinking water are protected. Davison	Have you come across any examples of institutional arrangements which favour domestic users rather than irrigators? Batchelor	Certainly in India going back a few hundred years there was a very strong tradition of villages managing their surface and ground water resources in such a way that the drinking water was protected during dry periods. These traditional systems of management could easily provide a starting point for improved management in these modern times. Davison	And would you say that those old traditional systems have underlying them a concept of water rights? Batchelor	Certainly the tank based systems were really linked to the fact that the water resource or the tank was a community resource. But what has happened since then is that the tank systems have failed and water resources in many village areas have become privatised. Individuals have sunk their own wells and they pump water for their own use. So in the situation that has developed in recent times, there is little incentive for people to work together to manage the water such that the individual rights to water are protected. End of tape.
