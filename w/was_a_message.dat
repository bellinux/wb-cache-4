5|$|Word of Merrimacks {{reconstruction}} and conversion was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when Mary Louveste of Norfolk, a freed slave {{who worked as}} a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on Merrimack, made her way through Confederate lines with news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship. Concealed in her dress <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> from a Union sympathizer who worked in the Navy Yard warning that the former Merrimack, renamed Virginia by the Confederates, was nearing completion. Upon her arrival in Washington Mary managed to meet with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and informed him that the Confederates were nearing the completion of their ironclad, which surprised Welles. Convinced by the papers Mary was carrying he had production of Monitor sped up. Welles later recorded in his memoirs that Mrs. Louveste encountered no small risk in bringing this information...|$|E

Rather than send a separate message to each person, which was the standard practice at the time, he had an assistant, Carl Gartley, write a single mass email. Reaction from the net community was fiercely negative, but the spam did generate some sales.|$|E

Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times.

25|$|As part {{of their}} investigation, police served Verizon and AT with search {{warrants}} to obtain cell phone billing records, and took Zahau's Samsung Focus cell phone as evidence. According to Zahau's AT cell phone billing records, from roughly 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., Zahau talked and texted with her older sister Mary Zahau-Loehner, who confirmed that Xena had arrived home safely. At 10:48p.m., Zahau received a text from Nina Romano, the twin sister of Shacknai's ex-wife Dina Romano. Nina Romano stated {{that she wanted to}} stop by the house and speak with Zahau about Max's accident. Zahau did not reply to that message. Police said she checked her voice-mail a few hours later, at 12:50a.m. on July 13, and listened to a message. Billing records do not show who left that message. Police stated it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> regarding the worsening of Max's condition, but declined to confirm at that time who left the message. Mary Zahau-Loehner stated that police told her it was from Jonah Shacknai. The message was deleted, meaning that police and Zahau's family never heard the contents of the message.|$|E

In contrast, Garnet believed that [...] "things were best settled by submission to the will of God." [...] He was ebullient over King James's succession to the English throne, and hoped there would be no foreign interference. Of the 1603 Bye Plot, revealed (with his blessing) to the Privy Council by two Catholic priests, he wrote that it was [...] "a piece of impudent folly, for we know that it is by peaceful means that his Holiness and other princes are prepared to help us." [...] He exhorted that Pope Clement VIII instruct all English Catholics not to engage in violent rebellion, [...] "quiete et pacifice". [...] It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> echoed by Archpriest George Blackwell, who commanded his priests never to attempt any such thing, but it proved controversial; early in summer 1605 Garnet reported to Rome that English Catholics had reached [...] "a stage of desperation".|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} Liberal leadership, Macdonald {{travelled}} the province on speaking tours helping organize party support in every constituency. As Liberal leader, he {{proved to be}} an effective platform speaker. According to biographer John Hawkins, Macdonald's [...] "plain talk and simplicity" [...] persuaded audiences of his honesty. He developed the ability to explain political issues with a [...] "clarity that every voter could understand". When the legislature was in session, he led the Liberals from the public galleries because he had no seat in the House. There were six vacancies, but the Conservatives refused to call by-elections fearing they would lose their five-seat majority. Macdonald publicly criticized Premier Gordon Harrington for depriving so many Nova Scotians of representation. He deplored what he called [...] "the loss of responsible government." [...] It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> that struck a chord in the province that had been the first in Canada to achieve responsible government in 1848 thanks to the efforts of the great liberal Reformer Joseph Howe. Privately however, Macdonald rejoiced that the government couldn't risk calling a by-election telling one supporter years later, [...] "If the truth must be told, I was sometimes afraid that they would open up a seat and deprive me of this sort of ammunition".|$|E

500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had said (over the intercom), that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> from the Apple office. Ono {{opened the door and}} saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at the back window, another person was banging on the window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon and pointed to a binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{focus on}} {{emotions}} was sparked by Chen, {{who felt that}} {{the primary purpose of}} entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. Chen tried to make the game focus more on emotions than on a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> of promoting green energy in the game. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. He summarized this view by saying that the only gameplay mechanic is hitting a flower to trigger a new event. The team specifically cut out deeper gameplay elements because these would have added [...] "challenge" [...] to the game, which, while fun, would not have been relaxing. Sony Santa Monica contracted with Bluepoint Games to create ports of the game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the PlayStation 4. [...] An iOS version was released in September 2017, published by Annapurna Interactive.|$|E
500|$|From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was {{a member}} of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group that {{included}} David Lander, Richard Beebe and Michael McKean. The group consisted of [...] "a bunch of newsmen" [...] at KRLA 1110, [...] "the number two station" [...] in Los Angeles. They wanted {{to do more than just}} straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. By the time he got home, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> on his answering machine asking, [...] "Can you come to work tomorrow?" [...] The group's radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by KPPC-FM, so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues. While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed Creedence Clearwater Revival for the Pop Chronicles music documentary. In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on How Time Flys, an album by The Firesign Theatre's David Ossman. The Credibility Gap broke up 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom Laverne & Shirley. Shearer started working with Albert Brooks, producing one of Brooks' albums and co-writing the film Real Life. Shearer also started writing for Martin Mull's television series Fernwood 2 Night. In the mid-1970s, he started working with Rob Reiner on a pilot for ABC. The show, which starred Christopher Guest, Tom Leopold and McKean, was not picked up.|$|E

[...] Rowell arrived in Port Moresby on 13 August 1942 and assumed command of New Guinea Force from Major General Basil Morris. Rowell's I Corps headquarters took over operational control from Morris's, which became that of ANGAU. The only warning that Morris had of Rowell's arrival <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> from the DCGS, Vasey, which simply said: [...] "Syd is coming". The situation was dire. Japanese were steadily advancing on Port Moresby along the Kokoda Trail and were also threatening Milne Bay and Wau. Rowell and his staff were all seasoned officers with combat experience in the Middle East and the Battle of Malaya and [...] "brought to New Guinea skill and organisation that Morris and his staff had been unable to provide". However, the main body of Rowell's staff did not arrive until 17 August. Rowell turned down a suggestion from Blamey that he needed additional base staff to cope with his administrative problems, given that a corps headquarters was a tactical headquarters, intended to operate as part of an army, with the latter handling most of the administrative work. Rowell's staff gradually discovered how enormous the task before them was; they had few maps, the only transport aircraft were destroyed in a Japanese raid, and the supplies that had been forwarded by air to Kokoda could not be located.|$|E
500|$|John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide {{spectrum}} of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu's award [...] "could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years". The open letter by Xu Youyu et al, which described Liu as [...] "a splendid choice" [...] because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice, amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists; it was posted in Chinese, English, French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China.

500|$|British efforts {{against the}} {{conspiracy}} and the expedition began in Europe. Even before Mahendra Pratap {{met with the}} Kaiser, attempts were made by British intelligence to assassinate V.N. Chatterjee {{while he was on}} his way to Geneva to invite Pratap to Berlin. British agents were present in Constantinople, Cairo, and Persia. Their main efforts were directed at intercepting the expedition before it could reach Afghanistan, and thence to exert pressure to ensure that the Emir maintained his neutrality. [...] Under the efforts of Sir Percy Sykes, British intelligence officers in Persia intercepted communications between the expedition and Prince Reuss in Tehran through various means. Among these were letters captured in November 1915 in which von Hentig gave details of the meetings with the Emir, and messages from Walter Röhr outlining the requirements for arms, ammunition, and men. The most dramatic intelligence coup <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> from von Hentig asking for a thousand Turkish troops and the necessity for [...] "internal revulsions" [...] in Afghanistan if need be. This message found its way to Russian intelligence and thence to the Viceroy, who passed on an exaggerated summary, warning the Emir of a possible coup funded by the Germans and a threat to his life. In mid-1916, intelligence officers in Punjab captured letters sent by the Indian provisional government's Ubaidullah Sindhi to Mahmud al-Hasan, which were addressed to the Turkish authority and the Sharif of Mecca. The letters, written in Persian on silk cloth, were sewn into a messenger's clothing when he was betrayed in Punjab. The event was named the Silk Letter Conspiracy. In August 1915, Mahendra Pratap's private secretary, Harish Chandra, had returned to Switzerland after a visit to India, at which time he had carried messages to various Indian princes. He was captured in Europe in October 1915. Chandra divulged details of the Provisional Government of India and of the expedition. He also gave to British intelligence officers letters from Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and Mahedra Pratap addressed to Indian princes. Subsequently, Chandra was sent as a double agent to the United States in 1917 to investigate and report on the revolutionary movement in Washington and the finances of the Ghadar Party. Also used as a double agent was a man by the name of Sissodia who claimed to be from a royal family of Rajputana; he attempted to infiltrate the Germans and the Berlin Committee in Zurich.|$|E
