25|$|A 60kW {{capacity}} <b>wind</b> <b>generator</b> {{is located}} on Black Rock Road in Breamlea. Erected in November 1987 by the then State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Victorian Solar Energy Council (now Energy Victoria) as a demonstration, it was sold in 1994 to the Alternative Technology Association of Melbourne. Electricity production ceased at 1200hrs on 17 May 2003 due to an electrical generator burn-out, caused by moisture, salt, and electrical flash-over. The <b>wind</b> <b>generator</b> remains in place today intact.|$|E
25|$|Blyth's {{original}} <b>wind</b> <b>generator</b> was {{the first}} known structure by which electricity was generated from wind power, but its lack of a braking mechanism meant it was prone to damage in strong winds. In the winter of 1887, some months after Blyth's first <b>wind</b> <b>generator</b> was built, American, Charles F. Brush built the first automatically operated wind turbine. The design of Brush's machine allowed it {{to be shut down}} manually to protect it from wind damage. The improved design of the turbine built for the Montrose Lunatic Asylum (which was based on Thomas Robinson's anemometer design) went some way towards solving this problem but it could not be guaranteed to stall in very strong winds.|$|E
25|$|The {{camp was}} {{situated}} between a main road and a railway line. The site {{consisted of a}} large communal area, a visitors centre and several personal dwellings. All buildings were made from re-cycled materials. The communal area featured seating, heating and a bookcase. The buildings were heated by wood burning fires and run off donated wood. Water was collected on a daily basis. Food was cooked on a calor gas oven {{and there was a}} composting toilet. A <b>wind</b> <b>generator</b> provided some of the evening lighting.|$|E

In this research, potential {{changes to the}} classiﬁcation and role of <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> in the Single Electricity Market (SEM), the market for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, are examined. The effect of <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> opting to become price-making {{and the potential for}} <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> to provide positive spinning reserve is investigated. By submitting bids for available generation, pricemaking <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> can increase their revenues from the market and inﬂuence the average electricity price. Results also show reduced emissions and systems costs arise in allowing wind to provide spinning reserve...|$|R
30|$|This {{accident}} exhibited unique characteristics. First, most <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> in Hami <b>wind</b> {{farms are}} direct-driven <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> (DDWGs), i.e., Type- 4 <b>wind</b> <b>generators.</b> Second, {{there is no}} series compensator in the region. Finally, the thermal generators and HVDC line showed no indication of SSO {{at the very beginning}} that the SSO current arouse. According to [7], this accident was the first reported SSO event caused by wind farms based on DDWGs. Thus far, researchers have not reached a consensus on the mechanism of this SSO.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} some areas where {{there is not a}} {{sufficient}} amount of solar radiation to justify using solar power. A common alternative or supplement is using wind turbines. To generate power, the average autonomous house needs only one small <b>wind</b> <b>generator,</b> 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.|$|E
25|$|Australia has {{excellent}} wind {{resources by}} world standards. The southern coastline {{lies in the}} roaring forties and hundreds of sites have average wind speeds above 8 or even 9m/s at 50m above ground (the hub height of a modern <b>wind</b> <b>generator).</b> The southwest of Western Australia, southern South Australia, western Victoria, northern Tasmania and elevated areas of New South Wales and Queensland have good wind resources. Several states engaged in systematic wind speed monitoring in the 1980s and 1990s, the results of which are publicly available. Australian wind farms produce on average capacity factors of 30–35%, making wind an attractive option. South Australia's large share (along with nearby Victoria) means most of Australia's wind power occurs around the same time. The correlation between South Australia and NSW is 0.34, whereas the correlation between South Australia and Tasmania is 0.10.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{establishes}} the whole dynamic model of <b>wind</b> turbine <b>generator</b> system which contains the wind speed model and DFIG wind turbines model. A simulation sample {{based on the}} mathematical models is built by using MATLAB in this paper. Research are did on the performance characteristics of doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> (DFIG) which connected to power grid with three-phase ground fault and the disturbance by gust and mixed wind. The capacity of the wind farm is 9 MW which consists of doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> (DFIG). Simulation results demonstrate that the three-phase ground fault occurs on grid side runs less affected on the stability of doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>generators.</b> However, as a power source, fluctuations of the wind speed will run a large impact on stability of double-fed <b>wind</b> <b>generators.</b> The results also show that if the two disturbances occur in the meantime, the situation will be very serious...|$|R
30|$|More {{simulations}} {{with different}} <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> and feeder parameters {{have been carried}} on and the results all show that under the above Mayr and PMSG/DFIG model, large-scale <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> connecting to grid has great impact on harmonic based algorithms: {{with the number of}} <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> increasing, the magnitude ratio between 3 rd harmonic and 1 st harmonic can be lower than the general ratio and thus the performance of harmonic based HIF detection algorithms is poor. Therefore, the characteristic of HIFs should be studied to replace the harmonic feature and improve the detection algorithms.|$|R
