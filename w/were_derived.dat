5|$|Many Māori {{place names}} possess either {{historical}} or mythological significance.

5|$|The PADI tables {{known as}} the PADI Recreational Dive Planner (RDP) were {{developed}} by Raymond Rogers and tested by DSAT (Diving Science And Technology, an affiliate of PADI Inc.).

The energy resolution was 8% at 511keV.

5|$|The name of {{the road}} matches its winding route, but {{actually}} derives from the emblem of the Snake Inn, {{one of the few}} buildings on the high stretch of road.

In the early 21st century, the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that the inn now refers to the road that referred to itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine.

The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E

5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage <b>were</b> <b>derived</b> from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} <b>were</b> <b>derived</b> almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{guidance}} from the Secretary of the Army, CDC established Qualitative Material Development Objectives (QMDO) for a rotary-wing aircraft with 195-knot (224mph, 361km/h) cruise speed, 220-knot (253mph, 407km/h) dash speed, and {{the capability to}} hover out-of-ground-effect (OGE) at 6,000feet (1,830m) on a 95°F (35°C) day.

The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDRE) conditionally approved the changes to the development objectives, pending his review of the proposed program. He also directed the Army {{to determine whether or}} not any other helicopter could offer an improvement in performance over the UH-1B in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these <b>were</b> <b>derived</b> from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages tales {{originating}} from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth.

These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, {{may have been}} based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.|$|E
