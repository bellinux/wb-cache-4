40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} occlusive disease (PAOD) {{occurs when}} there is narrowing or blockage of the peripheral arteries that carry blood to the extremities, most commonly the legs. The most common symptom of PAOD is intermittent claudication, or ischemic pain during exercise. Women with PAOD experience a greater extremity functional impairment than men. Since impaired vasodilation might cause the ischemic pain from PAOD, we should evaluate vasodilation post ligation in males and females in collateral vessels, which connect two arterial segments to maintain blood flow to an otherwise hypoxic area. First, we need to examine collateral vasodilation in unoperated male and female animals. The goal {{of this study was}} to create a consistent protocol to measure functional vasodilation in collaterals of male and female C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, and to test the hypothesis that unoperated male and female C 57 Bl/ 6 mice exhibit equal vasodilation. The spinotrapezius muscle allows for clear visualization of intramuscular collaterals, which in animal models and patients will undergo arteriogenesis in response to an arterial occlusion. The muscle was stimulated using microelectrodes to induce endogenous vasodilation, and resting and dilated diameters were recorded. Diameters obtained from covering the preparation <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>and</b> irrigating the preparation with a physiological salt solution (PSS) were also compared to determine the effect of the preparation of the muscle on vasodilation. As expected, there was no difference between the resting diameters or the dilated diameters of males and females when preparations were irrigated with PSS. Additionally, the preparation of the muscle had no effect on vasodilation. These findings suggest further investigation into vasodilation post ligation in males and females in collateral vessels...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{target spot}} {{is a disease}} caused by fungus Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & Curt.) Wei. This disease has {{occurred}} in several states of Brazil. It is a late season disease and causes economic losses in various crops such as soybeans [1]. Currently there is no adequate treatment for the control of C. cassiicola in organic cultivation of soybeans, since the application of fungicides for the control and management of diseases is not allowed by Brazilian legislation [2]. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} experiment was to test the effectiveness of high dilutions of Belladonna in vitro on mycelial growth of Corynespora cassiicola. &# 13; &# 13; Materials and Methods: The preliminary tests were conducted at the Laboratory of Plant Pathology, State University of MaringÃƒÂ¡ (UEM). The fungal isolate of C. cassicola was obtained from Embrapa Soja. The fungus was peaked and grown on PDA (potato dextrose agar) maintained at 25 Ã‚Â°C Ã‚Â± 2 and 12 h photoperiod. Belladonna dilutions (6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 dH) were obtained according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [3]. PDA culture medium plus Belladonna dilutions (6, 12, 24 and 30 dH) beyond the control containing distilled water were placed in petri dishes after filtration through a Millipore membrane (pore diameter of 0. 45 Ã‚Âµm). After medium solidification, a disc of mycelium (4 mm diameter) of C. cassiicola was peaked towards the center of each plate and sealed <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>and</b> then incubated at 25 Ã‚Â°C with 12 h photoperiod. The mycelial growth was measured daily for 8 days. The control consisted of distilled water. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and means were compared by Scott-Knott test (P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0. 05). &# 13; &# 13; Results and Discussion: All dilutions of Belladonna (6, 12, 24, 30 dH) were effective (p < 0. 05) in reducing the mycelial growth of C. cassiicola compared to control (Figure 1). Belladonna 30 dH was higher in all periods and the difference increased with time. Dilutions 6, 12 and 24 dH showed intermediate values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹but always higher than the control (Figure 1). &# 13; &# 13; It is known that the target spot cause pods rotting (seeds) and intense stems spots. When it causes root rot, the symptoms are characterized by yellow leaves and roots of dark-brown color. Thus, productivity is compromised by the lower pod filling and seed. The alternatives currently used are based on the use of fungicides, which increase the cost of production and affect the environment. Thus, the use of ultra-high diluted Belladonna for target spot control may be able to mitigate the damage of this fungus in soybean. Based on these results, we suggest that ultra-high dilutions of belladonna may be able to reduce production costs {{and at the same time}} benefit the environment through reduced environmental impact. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: The results obtained so far are encouraging. Belladonna presents as great potential in controlling the fungal disease caused by C. cassiicola, in vitro...|$|E
40|$|SCORCHED EARTH CROCODILES Guangchen Zhang Fall 2016 Kee-ho Yuen School of Art and Art History When I went to {{the bookstore}} last summer, I found a book about metal clay jewelry. There are many {{examples}} and tutorial {{about how to make}} jewelry with metal clay which I have never seen or done before. For my honors project, I wanted to study metal clay and explore the uses of this form of metalwork in rendering a 3 D animation figure of a crocodile. However, as I began my project, my instructor felt it would work better to learn how to make a mold to create the crocodile. I choose to create a crocodile because I was inspired and influenced by the character Renekton in the video game called League of Legends. When I first came to America, I was alone and helpless. However, I made some friends and became outgoing and optimistic by playing League of Legends. Renekton is a hero and most honored warrior in his country, and he protected his country, during wartime. I was encouraged by his brave and strong, so I decided to create a crocodile to remind me and encourage me to be courageous later in life. Because I didn 2 ̆ 7 t have an actual crocodile mold for casting, I used clay to form the basic form of the crocodile. When the clay was hard, I fixed the crocodile on a 4 X 4 wooden board with hot glue gun. To make the rubber mold, I cover the model <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>and</b> then 1 / 42 ̆ 2 clay. Then I covered the clay with plaster to create a plaster jacket which helped me hold the mold. After the plaster jacket had cured, I opened the jacket and removed all the clay inside of the jacket. Since the crocodile has too many undercuts and a huge tail, I had to build two parting lines to divide the jacket into three parts. After the plaster had dried, I drilled a hole {{at the top of the}} jacket and three small holes at each piece. Before I poured the rubber in the jacket, I tied the jacket with a belt and secured all gaps with clay. However, I overlooked two important facts, one, that the pressure is higher at the bottom than the top and second, my piece is too big. When I poured the rubber into the jacket, the rubber started to run out. I had to wait for all rubber run out and dry which took about one day. I cleaned the surface of the crocodile and re-poured the rubber into the jacket. I made the crocodile in a solid plastic to bear the weight of the heavy metal armour and the blade. After the figure was complete, I made the jacket with paper first. Then. I drew all the paper armour on one piece of brass, which I sawed and soldered to form the metal armour. To show his ruthlessness, I painted the armour in black and the blade point in blood red. I also painted the crocodile in green and red with oil paint. I enjoyed the process of making the crocodile, and I have learned how to make a silicone rubber mold and how to cast a plastic object. Since I have a silicon mold, I can now explore making more crocodiles in differing styles. I enjoyed this project, and in the future, I plan to look for a job that involves making molds and models for characters or objects...|$|E

For sequence analysis, biotinylation can be omitted. To biotinylate, add 15 ml/dish of 50 µg/ml biotin (Pierce # 21335 NHS-LC Biotin; prepare from freshly made stock [10 mg/ml in DMSO]). Incubate on ice for 90 min, aspirate biotin, then wash with (2) 5 ml/dish of PBS-glycine (0. 56 gm glycine in 150 ml PBS). - Remove cells by tapping the side of the dishes during the PBS-glycine washes if biotinylating, or in PBS wash if not biotinylating. Collect washes into two 50 ml conicals, spin for 5 min at 1500 rpm (4 °C), aspirate supernatant, combine the cell pellets into one 50 ml conical, resuspend in 25 ml of PBS-glycine if biotinylated, or in 1 ml of lysis buffer on ice for 25 min if not biotinylated. Spin PBS-glycine cells, aspirate supernatant, resuspend in 25 ml of PBS-glycine, respin, and resuspend in 1 ml of lysis buffer on ice for 25 min. ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 4. Transfer to two microfuge tubes and spin for 15 min at 4 °C. Use supernatant to apply to columns. Prepare columns (have blank precolumn, SNpeptide column [and for purification/sequencing, a Con A column]) in step 3) by first draining, then equilibrating in 6 volumes of column running buffer. Following equilibration, columns should be ‘preconditioned’ with 5 column buffers of eluant buffer (ie. column running buffer containing 1 µg/ml heparin), then wash with 6 column volumes of column running buffer. Allow supernatant to flow through precolumn into Con A or SNpeptide column. Incubate 6 hr to overnight at 4 °C. ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") 5. Wash with 20 column volumes of column running buffer. Elute SNpeptide column with 5 ml column running buffer containing 1 µg/ml heparin or in which MnCl 2 is replace with 10 - 20 mM EDTA. Elute Con A column with 5 ml column running buffer containing 0. 4 M a-methylmannoside. Next wash columns with 5 column volumes of column running buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 5 column volumes of column running buffer and then the same volume of 50 mM Tris containing 0. 02 % Azide for storage (4 °C). Be sure to keep column running without stop. 6. Subsequent analysis of eluant fractions can be performed following acetone precipitation of individual fractions, or spin concentration of all eluant fractions combined. For acetone precipitation (in 1. 5 ml screw top tubes, add 300 µl of each fraction to 300 µl of - 20 °C 100 % acetone, mix and store overnight at - 20 °C. Spin for 15 min at 4 °C, pull/discard supernatant and add 1 ml/tube of 50 % acetone (precooled to - 20 °C), mix and spin for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove/discard supernatant. Use yellow tip to remove all remaining supernatant and let pellet dry for 1 hr at RT.

Run at 25 mAmp/gel. For spin concentration, add part of eluant to a Centricon- 100 (preblocked by incubation in 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 hr at 4 °C; at end of block, spin for 15 min at 2500 rpm in SA 600 rotor with rubber inserts [4 °C]; then do a PBS wash). Spin for 30 min to 1 hr, discard flow through and more eluant and spin. Repeat until all has been concentrated to minimum volume. Add 1 / 6 volume SDS (2 - 5 %) gel sample buffer, boil for 5 min at 90 °C, place 2 min on ice, spin for 1 min (RT), and load all in one or two wide wells on a 8 % or 5 - 15 % SDS PAGE gel. Run at 25 mAmp/gel. 7. For biotinylated prep, electrotransfer from gel to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham#RPN 2020 D), as follows. Have blotting buffer prepared (can be reused a number of times; record each time used by marking label). Cut nitrocellulose to same size (or slightly larger) as gel. Have two pieces of Whatmann 2 MM paper cut to same size as gel. Have plastic tray containing transfer buffer and immersed in it in the following order: plastic cage (‘+’ side down), sponge (push out air bubbles), one piece of Whatmann paper and nitrocellulose filter. Turn off power to gel. Place gel plates on bench. Gently remove glass side. Notch bottom left corner. Discard stacking gel. Carefully invert gel onto nitrocellulose and use a spatula or gel spacer to encourage gel to separate from plate onto filter. Add onto gel in order: other Whatmann piece, sponge (remove bubbles), and other half of cage. Insert caged gel into blotting buffer and transfer (- from gel to + on filter) overnight at 60 mAmp (RT).

40|$|The {{objective}} of National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 04 - 36 was to recommend laboratory procedures to measure performance-related characteristics of pavement layers stabilized with cement, lime, and fly ash {{and to provide}} validated distress models to {{be incorporated into the}} Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). The {{objective of}} this specific study was to identify a procedure for determining the fatigue behavior of cementitiously stabilized materials (CSM) and modulus growth with time. A laboratory based, third-point flexural beam test and a non-destructive ultrasonic pulse velocity test were developed and applied to cementitiously stabilized materials. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements were conducted to assess non-destructively the flexural strength and flexural modulus of base and subgrade soil stabilized with cement, fly ash, and lime. The host materials selected for this study are classified as gravel (GM), sand (SP), silt (ML), and clay (CL) based on the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The host materials were stabilized with four binders: cement, Class C fly ash, lime-Class F fly ash, and lime. Laboratory tests to monitor the fatigue behavior of CSMs involved flexural strength, flexural modulus, and fatigue cracking tests. These tests were performed using a third-point flexural beam test for all CSMs. Prismatic molds of dimensions 102 mm � 102 mm � 400 mm were used to fabricate the beam specimens. Different curing procedures were applied to different mixtures depending on the binder. Cement-stabilized mixtures (gravel, sand, silt, and clay) were cured in the moist room (100 % relative humidity, 23 �C) for 28 d (ASTM D 558). Fly ash-stabilized mixtures (sand, silt, and gravel), clay-lime and silt-lime-Class F fly ash were sealed <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>and</b> cured in an oven set to 40 �C (ASTM C 593) for 7 d. Nine different mixtures were studied. The effect of density, binder content, and curing time was also studied. Additionally, modulus growth tests were conducted on these specimens. Resilient modulus tests were performed in general accordance with NCHRP 1 - 28 A on lightly stabilized materials and flexural modulus tests were performed on heavily stabilized soils. Cylindrical specimens were prepared for the resilient modulus tests. An ultrasonic velocity test system ?PUNDIT (Portable Ultrasonic Nondestructive Digital Indicating Tester) -Plus? manufactured by CNSFARNELL was used to measure the propagation speed of a pulse of ultrasonic longitudinal stress waves. The beam and cylindrical specimens were tested by the direct transmission of the pulse of ultrasonic longitudinal stress waves. P-wave velocity (or constrained modulus) of the CSMs was studied using the ultrasonic pulse velocity test. The ultrasound velocity tests were used to assess nondestructively the flexural strength and modulus as well as modulus growth. Results from the flexural strength tests showed clay-cement and silt-fly ash to have the highest and the lowest flexural strength among these nine mixtures, respectively. For the three class C fly ash stabilized soils (sand-fly ash, gravel-fly ash and silt-fly ash), the sand-fly ash specimen had the highest flexural strength, while the silt-fly ash specimen had the lowest flexural strength. The flexural strength was found to decrease when the specimens were under-compacted and to increase when the binder content and curing period increased. The flexural modulus test results indicate that determination of flexural modulus should be done at a stress level of 30 % to obtain consistent results. Among the nine mixtures, the highest and the lowest flexural modulus for the 30 % stress level (i. e., applied stress divided by flexural strength) was observed for the clay-cement and the silt-fly ash specimens, respectively. The non-plastic silt-fly ash specimens were the weakest mixture. For the fly ash-stabilized soils, the gravel-fly ash had the highest flexural modulus. The flexural modulus was found to increase with binder content for all stress levels. A linear relationship was developed between the flexural strength and flexural modulus. Also, a relationship between the unconfined compressive strength and flexural strength was found. In general, the fatigue life ranged between 1 and 75, 537 cycles in this study. The modulus kept degrading as the fatigue test continued, whereas the displacement increased. The fatigue life for different mixtures ranged from 44 % to 64 % of the initial modulus. The specimens compacted to a reduced dry density showed a lesser fatigue life than the specimens compacted to the target dry density. The sand-cement specimens with higher binder content did not perform well as compared to the sand-cement specimens with lower binder content. The fatigue life of sand-cement (6 % binder) was greater than the fatigue life of sand-cement (8 % binder) at the same stress level. For the gravel-cement specimens, there was not much improvement in the fatigue life with increase in binder content, but the silt-fly ash specimens performed better with increased binder. A stress-based fatigue model was developed using two parameters ? stress ratio (SR) and fatigue life (N) that resulted in a good fit for estimating the fatigue life. The R 2 values for the different specimens ranged between 0. 70 and 0. 95. The fatigue data from this study fitted very well to the MEPDG fatigue model, and also to most of the concrete fatigue models with varying degrees of success (R 2 ranged between 0. 50 and 1. 00). An attempt to develop a strain-based model using the initial strain (which is calculated from the fatigue test data) was also made. The model was a good fit (R 2 = 0. 79) for only the sand-fly ash mixture. The strain-based fatigue data was not found to be a suitable fit in this study. Results from the ultrasonic pulse velocity tests showed that with decrease in density of the specimens, constrained modulus and P-wave velocity decreases, whereas, with increase in binder content and curing time of the specimens, the constrained modulus and P-wave velocity increases. A relationship was found between the flexural strength and P-wave velocity (or constrained modulus) as well as between the flexural modulus and P-wave velocity (or constrained modulus). Flexural modulus as measured in beam tests was found to increase with time. Resilient modulus did not follow the same trend of increase probably due to the selected method that proved to be destructive. This might be due to the testing of the same specimen at different curing periods, which may have damaged the specimens. The ultrasonic pulse velocity tests showed a clear trend of increasing stiffness (constrained modulus) with time for all mixtures. This study showed that the developed third-point flexural beam test is appropriate for all combinations of binder and soil mixtures; i. e., lightly and heavily cementitiously stabilized materials. A stress-based fatigue model using two parameters, stress ratio (SR) and fatigue life, represent the fatigue behavior satisfactorily. A strain-based model was not suitable for all mixtures. The ultrasonic pulse velocity test proved to be a convenient non-destructive method for estimation of the flexural strength and flexural modulus. Furthermore, the ultrasonic velocity test allows for a convenient procedure to study modulus growth with time...|$|E

Investigators must be aware that {{they will need to}} tailor the following protocol for their own research objectives and tissue under study*. This method is used to detect genomic DNA deletions in tumor cells. For a more detailed discussion of applying this approach to microdissected samples, see [Allelic Loss Studies]([URL] in [Prostate MP at NCI]([URL] ### Reagents 1. DNA sample (see [Processing of Microdissected Tissue - DNA-based Analysis]([URL] - Proteinase K (Sigma) - Proteinase K buffer (0. 05 M tris-HCL, 0. 001 M EDTA, 1 % Tween 20, 0. 1 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 8. 0) - Ampli Taq Gold Buffer (Perkin Elmer) - dNTP mixture (Perkin Elmer) - Primers - DEPC-treated H 2 O - Ampli Taq Gold Polymerase (Perkin Elmer) - a- 32 P dCTP, 6000 Ci/mmol (NEN Dupont) - Formamide, 99 % (Fluka) - Bromophenol blue-Xylene cyanole (Sigma), reconstituted as directed - Gel Mix- 6 sequencing gel solution (Life Technologies) - Ammonium persulfate (Biorad) - 10 X TBE buffer (0. 89 M Tris Base, 0. 89 M Boric Acid 0. 02 M Disodium EDTA) (Advanced Biotechnologies) - Acrylease (Stratagene) - Glass cleaner (e. g., Windex, Glass Plus) - 95 % ethanol ### Equipment 1. Thermal cycler (MJ Research) - Sequencing gel electrophoresis apparatus (Gibco BRL) - High voltage power supply - Gel dryer (Life Technologies) - Glass plates, 31. 0 x 38. 5 cm (Life Technologies) - 0. 4 mm spacers (Life Technologies) - Casting boot (Life Technologies) - Shark tooth comb (Life Technologies) - Small clamps - Whatman blotting paper, 3 mm thickness - Kodak Biomax MR or AR film - Film cassette (Amersham Life Science) - Film processor ### Time Requirements 1. Gel preparation: 1. 5 - 2 hours. Polymerization requires 1 hour, but may stand overnight. - LOH reactions: 2. 5 hours (approximately 1 hour for set-up, 1. 5 for PCR) - High-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: 1 - 3 hours. Twenty minutes for set-up. Electrophoresis time varies according to product size. - Gel drying: 1 hour - Autoradiography: 1 hour- 2 days ### Methods *TIP: Investigators must be especially careful when using this methodology to analyze archival tissue specimens. Formalin fixation in particular results in DNA that is difficult to amplify and often produces inconsistent PCR results, including artifactual allelic loss and poor amplification of large products. Therefore, when this technique is used to analyze archival samples, it is highly recommended that replicate experiments (multiple independent dissections, triplicate PCR reactions, etc.) be used to verify results*. **A: LCM and Proteinase K Treatment** 1. Obtain microdissected cells using the [LCM procedure]([URL] - *TIP: The number of cells needed to successfully perform the assay varies depending on the quality and processing conditions of the tissue samples. One thousand cells is recommended as a good starting point*. - Suspend approximately 1000 microdissected cells in 20 µl proteinase K buffer. - Incubate overnight at 37 °C. **B: Prepare the Glass Plates** *TIP: Use Accuwipes for cleaning purposes, as they will not leave lint behind and are non-abrasive*. 1. Clean glass plates twice with glass cleaner. - Repeat using 95 % EtOH. - Spray small plate with Acrylease. - Spread Acrylease evenly using a circular motion. - Buff dry. - Quickly assemble the plates without touching the clean surface. - Place 0. 4 mm spacers on the edges of the larger plate. - Place the smaller glass plate on top of the larger plate and spacers. - Secure the plates with a casting boot (tape or clamps may be substituted for the casting boot). **C: Polymerize the Gel** *TIP: Acrylamide is a neurotoxin. Be sure to wear gloves and a labcoat when working with this substance*. 1. Add 480 µl of 10 % ammonium persulfate to 75 ml of Gel-mix- 6. - Mix by inversion. - Hold the nozzle of the bottle {{at the corner of the}} gel cast. - Hold the gel cast at a 45 o angle to the bench and pour the gel between the plates. If bubbles get trapped between the plates, remove them by tapping the outside of the plates or by tipping the plates upright. - Insert the straight side of the comb approximately 1 cm into the gel. If bubbles are introduced at this point, remove the comb and use the teeth of the comb to sweep out small bubbles. - Clamp the top of the plates together. - Allow the gel to polymerize for at least one hour. - *TIP: The gel can be left to polymerize overnight. However, if bubbles appear, the gel has begun to separate from the plates. To minimize separation, wrap the gel in plastic film and store at 4 °C until use*. **D: PCR Reaction** *TIP: Investigators must be especially careful when using this methodology to analyze archival tissue specimens. Formalin fixation in particular results in DNA that is difficult to amplify and often produces inconsistent PCR results, including artifactual allelic loss and poor amplification of large products. If this technique is to be utilized for analysis of archival samples, we highly recommend that replicate experiments (multiple independent dissections, triplicate PCR reactions, etc.) be used to verify results*. 1. Remove reagents from the freezer before beginning the procedure. - Thaw thoroughly before use. - Prepare all reactions on ice. - Prepare the reduced cytosine mixture prior to beginning the LOH reaction setup. - Vortex all reagents, with the exception of Taq Gold Polymerase before beginning the PCR reaction setup. - Prepare 320 µl reduced nucleotide mixture: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 3. Aliquot 1 µl of each DNA sample into a separate PCR tube and set aside. - *TIP: DNA that is recovered from microdissected samples and "semi-purified" using a one-step proteinase K buffer will sometimes produce "non-specific" PCR products in addition to the true alleles. Moreover, larger alleles will sometimes amplify much less well than smaller alleles. Thus, normal-cell DNA recovered from the same tissue section as the tumor DNA serves as the best control for determining the presence or absence of allelic loss*. 4. Prepare sufficient volume of the reaction mixture in a separate tube for all reaction tubes: ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") 5. Thoroughly mix the reaction mixture by pipetting and dispense 9 µl of the reaction mixture into each tube containing DNA sample. - *TIP: Be sure to mix the LOH reaction mixture with the DNA sample by pipetting. This is especially critical for DNA from microdissected samples that has been processed through a one-step proteinase K-based "purification. "* 6. Cap the reaction tubes and place them in a thermal cycler. 7. Cycle the reactions according to Tm of the specific primer set. 8. After PCR, remove the samples from the thermal cycler and dispense 2 µl of formamide/dye solution (95 % formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0. 05 % bromophenol blue, 0. 05 % xylenecyanole) into each reaction tube. 9. Store reactions at 4 °C until the gel is ready for loading. - *TIP: Investigators may want to consider the "touchdown" procedure for PCR by Don RH, Cox PT, Wainwright BJ, Baker K, Mattick JS: "Touchdown" PCR to circumvent spurious priming during gene amplification. Nucl Acids Res 19 : 4008, 1991. Advantages include*: - Much cleaner bands, since by starting with a high annealing temperature of 66 degrees and lowering 1 degree every cycle, the first PCR products are the most specific ones. - The exact same protocol can be used for all primers. **E: Finalize Gel Preparation** 1. Remove the gel from the casting boot. - Push the spacers into the gel until they are flush with the smaller glass plate to prevent the buffer from leaking during electrophoresis (spacers tend to get pushed out of the gel during polymerization). - Place the gel in the sequencing apparatus and close the buffer release valve. - Pour 500 ml of 0. 5 X TBE buffer in the upper chamber and 500 ml of 1 X TBE buffer in the lower chamber. - Remove the comb and clear bubbles from the loading area with a pipette. - Insert the teeth of the comb approximately 1 mm into the gel. - Pre-heat the gel at 1700 volts for 15 - 20 minutes. **F: Gel Loading** 1. Remove the samples from the freezer. - Denature the samples in a thermal cycler at 95 °C for 5 mins. - Remove samples from the thermal cycler and immediately place on ice, with an ice pack on top of the samples, for 1 min. - Turn off the power supply. - Adjust comb if it has been pushed out of the gel during pre-heating. - Load 4 µl of each sample per well. - TIP: It is best to skip lanes to avoid contamination caused by leaking between the wells. - Run the gel at 1700 volts for 1 - 2 hours (running time based on PCR product size). **G: Separate the Gel** 1. Turn off the power supply. - Drain buffer chambers (buffer must be disposed of in a liquid radioactive waste carboy). - Remove the gel from the sequencing apparatus. - Separate the plates by removing the spacers and inserting the tips of two thin spatulas in their place. - Gently lift the spatulas until the top plate separates from the lower plate and gel. - Place Whatman paper on the gel. - Slowly peel the Whatman paper and gel off the glass plate. - Cover the gel <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>and</b> dry on a gel dryer for 1 hour. **H: Autoradiography** 1. Remove the plastic wrap from the gel. - Place the gel in an autoradiography cassette. - Expose film 1 hour- 2 days using Kodak BioMax MR or AR film. - *TIP: Use MR film for maximum resolution of bands. An intensifying screen is useful when analyzing PCR products from small numbers of microdissected cells*. ### References 1.
