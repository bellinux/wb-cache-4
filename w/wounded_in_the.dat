5|$|US losses {{during the}} battle were {{extremely}} light; unusual for fighting {{at a time in}} which other UN offensive forces were paying a heavy price when making similar pushes against the North Korean troops. The US infantry forces suffered only five killed and 54 <b>wounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 27th Infantry, plus three killed and 16 <b>wounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 23rd Infantry. This brought the total American casualty count to 8 dead, 70 wounded. South Korean troops suffered much more heavily during the fight. An estimated 2,300 South Korean men were killed in the fighting; 2,244 enlisted men and 56 officers. However, these losses were not crippling, as volunteers poured in from the surrounding countryside to fight for the South Korean Army.|$|E

5|$|Agamemnon {{was part}} of Vice-Admiral Robert Calder's fleet {{cruising}} off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, when the combined Franco-Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to windward. The British ships formed into line of battle, with Agamemnon fifth in the line, and engaged Admiral Villeneuve's fleet in hazy conditions with light winds. Agamemnon had three men <b>wounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Cape Finisterre, and lost her mizzen topmast and the foresail yard. By nightfall, Calder's fleet had become scattered, and he signalled for the action to be discontinued.|$|E
5|$|As Naiad, Triton and Alcmene {{streamed}} past {{in pursuit}} of Santa Brigida, Young focused his attention on Thetis, coming within range at 11:30. Mendoza, seeing that battle was inevitable, bore up across Ethalions bows {{in an effort to}} rake Young's ship. Young turned in order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which responded in kind. For an hour the frigates exchanged running fire until Mendoza, realising escape was impossible, surrendered. Thetis had lost one man killed and nine <b>wounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exchange while Ethalion had suffered no casualties.|$|E
5|$|As the American and South Korean forces {{approached}} the Chinese defenses, they {{were met with}} grenades, Bangalore torpedoes, shaped charges and rocks.

Although the 31st Infantry Regiment was equipped with ballistic vests in the first mass military deployment of modern personal armor; its 1st and 3rd battalions nevertheless suffered 96 fatalities, with an additional 337 men <b>wounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first attack – the heaviest casualties the 31st Infantry Regiment had suffered {{in a single day}} during the war.|$|E
