5|$|Family {{holidays}} usually {{were spent}} with the Waugh aunts, at Midsomer Norton, {{in a house}} lit with oil lamps, a time that Waugh recalled <b>with</b> <b>delight,</b> many years later. At Midsomer Norton, Evelyn became deeply interested in high Anglican church rituals, the initial stirrings of the spiritual dimension that later dominated his perspective of life, and he served as an altar boy at the local Anglican church. During his last year at Heath Mount, Waugh established and edited The Cynic school magazine.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{at having}} lost Steinbock's company, Bette swears vengeance on the Hulot family. She works {{behind the scenes}} with Valérie to extract more money from Baron Hulot. Valérie also seduces Crevel and watches <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> as they vie for her attention. With Bette's help, Valérie turns to Steinbock and draws him into her bedroom. When Hortense learns of his infidelity, she leaves Steinbock and returns with their son {{to live with her}} mother Adeline. Valérie also proclaims her love to a Brazilian Baron named Henri Montès de Montéjanos, and swears devotion {{constantly}} to each of the five men.|$|E
25|$|News of the Anglo-Dutch {{victory over}} Parma was greeted <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> amongst the States General and in England. A ballad {{was written by}} a Londoner titled the Happie Ouerthrowe of the Prince of Parma his powers before the knodtsen burg sconce xxj of July 1591.|$|E

25|$|Kitri, an inn-keeper's daughter, steals out of {{her house}} to meet her beloved, the barber Basilio. Her father, Lorenzo, sees the lovers and sends Basilio away, {{bringing}} Kitri to tears. Now comes the rich nobleman Gamache, who, likewise in love with Kitri, goes to Lorenzo and asks for his daughter's hand. The innkeeper accepts <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> but Kitri, appalled at the thought of wedding the foppish nobleman, runs away.|$|E
25|$|Ray seized his chance, and in {{his first}} CFL start threw for four touchdowns against the B.C. Lions. As fans watched <b>with</b> <b>delight,</b> Ray piled up {{remarkable}} numbers during Maas's recovery, leading to an inevitable showdown when the former starter returned. After missing three weeks, Maas returned against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and was utterly forgettable. One mediocre game was all Higgins needed to see and Maas was immediately sent to the bench in favour of Ray, who started the next five games.|$|E
25|$|Roderick tells Dongalor he {{has found}} no weapons in the castle, but says he has grown fond of the peasant girl and taking her with him, despite Dongalor’s protests. Later, Barnabus {{provides}} Dongalor with a letter with a plan he says will wipe out all the resistance fighters; {{the identity of the}} letter-writer, which makes Dongalor yodel <b>with</b> <b>delight,</b> is not revealed. Meanwhile, Kröd and a reawkening Aneka are dropped off in the forest by their mysterious savior, who rides off ahead without them to drive the guards off their scent; Aneka is clearly left love-stricken by the man.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the name}} Orzelda, former bassist Craig Orzel {{released}} a solo album, The Wee Shop Is Filled <b>With</b> <b>Delights,</b> in 2008, <b>with</b> the EPs My Dress Up and Spiders following in 2010.|$|R

25|$|The Third Reich tacitly tolerated Huch's {{contempt}} {{for it as}} long as she was not too vocal about her opinions. James contrasts this silence with Huch’s younger, rebel years, when she intellectually admired Benito Mussolini's and Mikhail Bakunin’s anarchist origins. He describes how Huch stole her sister's husband and otherwise treated men and suitors in a manner that was stunning given her place and time. James believes this rebel attitude never died, as evidenced by the fact that she wrote <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> about the first air raid she experienced, in June 1943. Although 79 at the time, she enjoyed the destroyed buildings and rubble.|$|E
25|$|The {{people are}} {{gathered}} at the square to watch the executions. The crowd is restless. Koroghlu's struggle for freedom has infused people with courage. People are protesting and loudly curse the khan. They receive the convicted persons with empathy; beautiful Nigar stands motionless on the scaffold {{with the support of}} her friends. She is the first to be executed. Hassan khan appears and orders the execution to begin. There is no fear in the courageous heart of Nigar. She angrily blames the khan. At that moment when the executioner' readies his axe Koroghlu's soldiers burst into the square and set the convicted free. It is the men who ordered the executions who receive the punishment. The people greet Koroghlu <b>with</b> <b>delight..</b>|$|E
25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first Scott defines poetry, making his debts to earlier theorists clear: All antiquity, {{following}} their great leader Aristotle, have defined poetry to be an art of imitation, or an instrument of reason, that consists in laying down the rules and way how in style to feign or represent things, <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> to teach to move us to good; as if one should say with the lyric Simonides (after whom Sir Philip Sidney saith) the poem is a speaking or wordish picture' (Cambridge edition, p. 6). Scott then discusses the 'genus' (matter), difference' (form) and 'end' of poetry in turn, dealing with such questions as the source of poetic inspiration, and the temperament required of the poet.|$|E

6000|$|... "My," [...] she ejaculated {{after a long}} {{scrutiny}} of me, [...] "I b'lieve {{you are one of}} them!" [...] and she gazed at me <b>with</b> <b>delighted</b> awe. I suppose William tells them of our splendid doings.|$|R
25|$|In November 1657 Henry {{himself was}} made lord-deputy; but before {{this time he}} had refused a gift of {{property}} worth £1500 a year, basing his refusal {{on the grounds of}} the poverty of the country, a poverty which was not the least of his troubles. In 1657 he advised his father not to accept the office of king, although in 1654 he had supported a motion to this effect; and after the dissolution of Cromwell's second parliament in February 1658 he showed his anxiety that the protector should act in a moderate and constitutional manner. After Oliver's death Henry hailed <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> the succession of his brother Richard to the office of protector, but although he was now appointed lieutenant and governor-general of Ireland, it was only with great reluctance that he remained in that country.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{residing}} {{with his}} father as he strove to find his own voice and work out his philosophical ideas, Hazlitt also stayed over with his older brother John, who had studied under Joshua Reynolds and was following {{a career as a}} portrait painter. He also spent evenings <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> in London's theatrical world, an aesthetic experience that would prove, somewhat later, of seminal importance to his mature critical work. In large part, however, Hazlitt was then living a decidedly contemplative existence, one somewhat frustrated by his failure to express on paper the thoughts and feelings that were churning within him. It was at this juncture that Hazlitt met Samuel Taylor Coleridge. This encounter, a life-changing event, was subsequently to exercise a profound influence on his writing career that, in retrospect, Hazlitt regarded as greater than any other.|$|E
25|$|A Player scoring no pins after bowling three {{balls in}} the leg is known as scoring a 'Spider'. A spider is {{recorded}} by drawing legs and a face onto the zero {{on the board and}} is greeted <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> when the opposing team returns to the alley. A 'Spare' where the pins are reset after being felled with balls to spare is denoted on the board by a circle drawn around the score. This is not greeted so favourably. The maximum score in a 9-pin frame is 27, however this is virtually unheard of, the highest spare {{in the history of the}} Worcester and District was thought to be a 24 scored by Gary Sandbrook whilst playing for the Independents Skittle team in the early 1990s, the highest spare in the friendly league was achieved by Scott Heywood with a full house score of 27 at the Alma tavern whilst playing for the Rushwick Cavalier on 18 September 2014. Spares are not uncommon however, and a good score in the Worcester game is 40 plus.|$|E
6000|$|CARMODY (with a grin). You did, darlin', and fair, too. (Tom slinks back to {{the chair}} {{in the rear of}} table, sulking. Carmody pats Nora's red hair <b>with</b> <b>delighted</b> pride.) Sure it's you can beat the divil himself! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{accordingly}} {{took her}} one morning to my favorite retreat. She looked around, <b>with</b> <b>delighted</b> surprise, upon the rustic seat, the bower, the tree carved with emblems of the tender passion. She turned her eyes upon me to inquire the meaning.|$|R
60|$|Under his {{guidance}} {{my sisters}} and myself soon entered upon a more extended range of studies; but while they wandered, <b>with</b> <b>delighted</b> minds, through the wide field of history and belles-lettres, a nobler walk was opened to my superior intellect.|$|R
500|$|Hazlitt proclaims The Winter's Tale as [...] "one of the best-acting of our author's plays", and recalls <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> {{some of his}} {{favourite}} {{actors who}} played the parts, including Sarah Siddons and John Kemble. He notes the incisive psychology of the unfolding of King Leontes's madness, the appealing roguery of Autolycus, and the charm of Perdita's and Florizel's speeches, after wondering {{how it could be}} that Pope doubted the authenticity of the play as Shakespeare's.|$|E
500|$|After {{having her}} first child, Constantine {{suffered}} from severe postnatal depression and panic attacks. Upon discovering {{that she was}} pregnant for a third time, as well as being overcome <b>with</b> <b>delight,</b> she felt despair as it came at a time when best friend Trinny Woodall was struggling to conceive and undergoing IVF treatment. In an interview Constantine said that she [...] "couldn't bear to tell her." [...] A short time later however, Woodall became pregnant.|$|E
500|$|She viewed Arabians as {{requiring}} a smart and gentle approach. She advocated for trainers {{who used the}} methods of master horsemen such as Ray Hunt and Tom Dorrance, with Dorrance's philosophy being especially suitable for Arabians. She considered the breed to be inherently gentle, and pointed out that any horse can become [...] "hot" [...] if they are kept in a stall 24hours a day, fed a lot of grain, and never ridden. Varian explained the nature of Arabian horses by analogy, comparing them to precocious children who show their ability <b>with</b> <b>delight,</b> but cannot be bullied or pushed around.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the {{one place}} where time stands still," [...] he said, looking around him <b>with</b> <b>delighted</b> eyes. [...] "There is nothing changed about this house or garden since I was here twenty-five years ago. It makes me feel young again." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the sweetest}} {{incident}} of Anne's sojourn in Bolingbroke was {{the visit to}} her birthplace--the little shabby yellow house in an out-of-the-way street she had so often dreamed about. She looked at it <b>with</b> <b>delighted</b> eyes, as she and Phil turned in at the gate.|$|R
60|$|That {{filled her}} <b>with</b> {{extraordinary}} <b>delight,</b> {{to see the}} smile cross his face, reflected from her face. She remembered that was how a baby smiled. It filled her <b>with</b> extraordinary radiant <b>delight.</b>|$|R
500|$|Ferrier's {{association}} with Glyndebourne bore further fruit when Rudolf Bing, the festival's general manager, recommended her to Bruno Walter as the contralto soloist {{in a performance}} of Mahler's symphonic song cycle Das Lied von der Erde. This was planned for the 1947 Edinburgh International Festival. Walter was initially wary of working with a relatively new singer, but after her audition his fears were allayed; [...] "I recognised <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> that here potentially {{was one of the}} greatest singers of our time", he later wrote. Das Lied von der Erde was at that time largely unknown in Britain, and some critics found it unappealing; nevertheless, the Edinburgh Evening News thought it [...] "simply superb". In a later biographical sketch of Ferrier, Lord Harewood described the partnership between Walter and her, which endured until the singer's final illness, as [...] "a rare match of music, voice and temperament." ...|$|E
500|$|Defending {{along an}} over-extended front, the Serbian Supreme Command decided to abandon Belgrade. The city was {{evacuated}} on 29/30 November. The Austro-Hungarians entered {{the city on}} 1 December, prompting yet more celebrations in Vienna. The Serbian people withdrew alongside their army and many retreated to Niš, where news of Belgrade's fall was greeted [...] "impassively", {{as it had been}} [...] "expected {{since the beginning of the}} war". Albin Kutschbach, a German agent in Niš, reported: [...] "More refugees are arriving by the day, and despite many people being sent on south, there are certainly still 60,000 people here." [...] Germany responded to the capture of Belgrade <b>with</b> <b>delight</b> and sent a congratulatory telegram to the Austro-Hungarian leadership. The Austro-Hungarians ascertained that their war with Serbia would soon be over and began preparing for the country's occupation. On 2 December, the anniversary of Franz Joseph's 66th year on the throne, Potiorek wrote that he was [...] "laying town and fortress Belgrade at His Majesty's feet".|$|E
500|$|Looking at how [...] "Steinman's old-fashioned teen-dream rock 'n' roll fantasies" [...] fits in {{with the}} music culture of 1993, Kerrang! {{suggests}} that it wouldn't appeal to [...] "Nirvana and Metallica fans, but there's an older generation of rockers out there who will, quite properly, worship this album." [...] Their four-star review declares that [...] "it {{is a work of}} genius, a ready made rock classic and arguably the last word in rock operas." [...] In The Tip Sheet, Jonathan King labelled it a [...] "glorious, splendid album," [...] celebrating Meat Loaf's [...] "operatically gorgeous" [...] voice and Steinman's [...] "superb" [...] songs, arrangements and production. [...] "You'll be blown away. Better still you'll catch yourself openly laughing out loud at times <b>with</b> <b>delight.</b> You know what to expect yet it's constantly better, fresher and brighter than you hope. If they had a Mercury Music Prize for American albums, this would win it hands down." ...|$|E
