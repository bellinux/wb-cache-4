5|$|After {{arriving}} in Australia, {{all members of}} the 9th Division were given three weeks leave. The men were then assembled in their home state capital and took part in a welcome-home march; these marches were conducted both to acknowledge the division's service in the Middle East and advertise a war loan drive. Following the marches the division re-assembled at training camps on the Atherton Tableland in far North Queensland, where it was to complete its training for jungle warfare. The 9th Division next saw action against Japanese forces during the Salamaua–Lae campaign in New Guinea during September 1943; had the division not returned from the Middle East, at least part of this task <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> to less-experienced militia units.|$|E
5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, Paramount Pictures hired Stephen Sommers {{to direct}} the film after his {{presentation}} to CEO Brad Grey and production prexy Brad Weston was well received. Sommers had been inspired to explore the G.I. Joe universe after visiting Hasbro's headquarters in Rhode Island. The project had found the momentum based {{on the success of}} Transformers, which di Bonaventura produced with Murphy. Sommers partly signed on to direct because the concept reminded him of James Bond, and he described an underwater battle in the story as a tribute to Thunderball. Stuart Beattie was hired to write a new script for Sommers's film, and G.I. Joe comic and filecard writer Larry Hama was hired as creative consultant. Hama helped them change story elements that fans would have disliked and made it closer to the comics, ultimately deciding fans would enjoy the script. He persuaded them to drop a comic scene at the film's end, where Snake Eyes speaks. To speed up production before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, John Lee Hancock, Brian Koppelman and David Levien also assisted in writing various scenes. Goldner said their inspiration was generally Hama's comics and not the cartoon. Sommers said {{had it not been for}} the rich backstory in the franchise, the film <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> behind schedule because of the strike.|$|E

25|$|However, not all {{restoration}} {{work was}} purely negative: {{a side effect}} of a number of restorations was the rediscovery of long-lost features, for instance Anglo-Saxon carving that had been incorporated into Norman foundations, or wall-paintings that had been whitewashed over, at St Albans Cathedral. It is also true to say that had they not been restored many churches <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> into disrepair.|$|E

25|$|Wellington {{believed}} that the Spanish besiegers were lax in allowing the French to successfully forage for food. The British commander thought that if the wheat fields had been burned and the gardens ruined that Pamplona <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> three weeks earlier. In fact, Cassan's ability to hold out into the autumn forced Wellington to keep Hill's corps at the Roncevaux Pass where it endured constant rain and snow that put many soldiers in the hospital. More significantly, Wellington refused to order his army to move into France until Pamplona had fallen. By this measure, Cassan performed a good service to his emperor.|$|E
25|$|A mass fall {{occurred}} as the climbers began the traverse. George Bell slipped {{and fell on}} a patch of hard ice, pulling off his rope-mate Tony Streather. As they fell their rope became tangled with those connecting Houston, Bates, Gilkey and Molenaar, pulling all these climbers off as well. Finally the strain came onto Pete Schoening, who had been belaying Gilkey and Molenaar. Quickly wrapping the rope around his shoulders and ice axe, Schoening held all six climbers, some of whom had by that point fallen over 100m. Had he not done so, the entire team, apart from Craig who was unroped, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> around 2000m to the Godwin-Austen Glacier.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Reserve allowed {{some large}} public bank {{failures}} – particularly {{that of the}} New York Bank of United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed.

25|$|Multnomah County police {{consistently}} suspected {{foul play}} in the Martins' disappearance, {{based on the evidence}} of the tire tracks that indicated the family's vehicle was deliberately pushed from the cliff. Also troubling were the reported sightings of the family at dusk on the north bank of the river in Washington state, while the tire tracks placed them {{on the south side of}} the river in Oregon; this would suggest that their car <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> over the cliff after nightfall. The arrest of the two ex-convicts in the Hood River area the day after the family's disappearance, for car theft, was also noted, though police were unable to determine if the incidents were related.|$|E
25|$|City {{started the}} 2016–17 season with mixed form, winning two and losing {{two of their}} opening four games. This was {{followed}} by a run of victories that resulted in the Imps sitting top of the table after a victory at Tranmere, the first time the club had topped any table in ten years. The form again dipped with defeats to Dover and Barrow in late September, but that would be the last time that the Imps would taste defeat in any competition until a last minute defeat to Guiseley on Boxing Day. During that run the Imps travelled to run-away leaders Forest Green and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> twelve points behind with a defeat, but three goals in the final 30 minutes turned around a 2–0 deficit.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} island was {{apparently}} settled to some extent in prehistoric times, it may already have lost bird species then. The geological data indicates that Kiritimati is quite old, was never completely underwater in the Holocene at least, and thus it might have once harbored highly distinct wetland birds. The limited overall habitat diversity on Kiritimati nonetheless limits the range of such hypothetical taxa, as does biogeography due to its remote location. At least one, possibly several Gallirallus and/or Porzana rails make the most likely candidates, given their former {{presence in the region}} and that conditions on Kiritimati would seem well suited. Perhaps a Todiramphus kingfisher was also present; such a bird would probably have belonged to the sacred kingfisher (T. sanctus) group as that species today occurs as a vagrant in Micronesia, and related forms are resident in southeastern Polynesia. These birds <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> victim to the Polynesian rat and, {{in the case of the}} rails which would have almost certainly been flightless, hunting by natives.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure to}} {{contemplate}} the possibility, that the troops at Y and S beaches might need to support the main landings, also exposed the failure to retain a reserve {{under the control of}} the Commander-in-Chief. Oglander speculated that had there been two battalions available, to land at the weakest point that the main landings had revealed in the Ottoman defences, Helles and Sedd el Bahr <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> by midday. Such a manoeuvre would have needed good communication between land and sea but the difficulty was underestimated and hampered British operations all day. The obvious difficulties of moving troops in open boats by instalments had been distracting, particularly the moments between disembarkation and reaching the shore, despite the confidence of the navy in its plans for bombardment. The apprehension was justified and the landing at V Beach was only saved from catastrophe by the covering fire of the machine-guns on River Clyde; defeat at W Beach was only averted by turning the Ottoman right flank. Lack of experience of opposed landings under modern conditions, made it difficult to rally scattered units and the challenge of organising an advancing inland was underestimated. It had been a mistake not to stress to all members of the landing force, that there would be little time to move inland before Ottoman reinforcements arrived.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the recent flurry of activity on the subject, Ian Mladjov reevaluated the question and presented a completely novel solution. He dismissed each of the prior theories in turn as insufficiently grounded and incompatible given the historical record, and further argued {{that many of the}} proposed solutions would have meant that later documented marriages <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> within the prohibited degree of kinship, yet there is no record the issue of consanguinity was ever raised with regard to these marriages. He argued that the documentary testimony of Agatha's origins is tainted or late, and concurred with Humphreys' evaluation that the names of the children and grandchildren of Agatha, so central to prior reevaluations, may have had non-family origins (for example, Pope Alexander II, having {{played a critical role in}} the marriage of Malcolm and Margaret, may have inspired their use of that name). However, he then focused in on the name of Agatha as being critical to determining her origin. He concluded that of the few contemporaries named Agatha, only Agatha Chryselia, the wife of Samuel of Bulgaria could possibly have been an ancestor of Edward the Exile's spouse. Some of the other names associated with Agatha and used to corroborate theories based in onomastics were present within the Bulgarian ruling family at the time, including Mary and several Davids. Mladjov inferred that Agatha was granddaughter of Agatha Cryselia, daughter of Gavril Radomir, Tsar of Bulgaria by his short-lived first marriage to a Hungarian princess thought to have been the daughter of Duke Géza of Hungary. This hypothesis has Agatha born in Hungary after her parents divorced, her mother being pregnant when she left Bulgaria, yet would entail her mother naming her after the mother of the Bulgarian prince who had just rejected her. Traditional dates of this divorce would seem to preclude the suggested relationship, but the article re-examined some long-standing assumptions about the chronology of Gavril Radomir's marriage to the Hungarian princess, and concludes that its dating to the late 980s is unsupportable, and that its dissolution belongs in c. 1009-1014. The argument is based almost exclusively on the onomastic precedent but is said to vindicate the intimate connection between Agatha and Hungary attested in the Medieval sources. Mladjov speculates further that the medieval testimony could largely be harmonized were one to posit that Agatha's mother was the same Hungarian princess who married Samuel Aba of Hungary, his family fleeing to Kiev after his downfall, thereby allowing a Russian marriage for Agatha.|$|E
500|$|For {{his first}} start on July 4, 1972 at Aqueduct Racetrack, Secretariat was made the lukewarm {{favorite}} at 3–1. At the start, a horse named Quebec cut {{in front of the}} field, causing a chain reaction that resulted in Secretariat being bumped hard. According to jockey Paul Feliciano, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> if he hadn't been so strong. Secretariat recovered, only to run into traffic on the backstretch. In tenth position {{at the top of the}} stretch, he closed ground rapidly and finished fourth, beaten by only [...] lengths. In many of his subsequent races, Secretariat hung back at the start, which Laurin later attributed to the bumping he received in his debut.|$|E

500|$|The climatic {{scene where}} Olivia {{encounters}} Nick {{and the group}} {{of people at the}} top of the building was shot at 902 Broadway in Manhattan. Though the actors appeared to be on the edge of a very tall building, there was in fact a hidden roof extending out that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> on instead. The visual and special effects departments worked in conjunction to simulate the woman jumping off the building. While the actress simply jumped onto a tarp several feet below her, the crew rigged the car with pneumatic rams, air cannons, and cables to implode under the [...] "weight" [...] of her body, and then CGI was used to make the woman appear to fall on the car.|$|E
500|$|Inhabitation of Chester {{continued}} on a lesser scale once the legions had left. Buildings <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> into disrepair, {{although some of}} the larger structures are known to have survived for some time. The town nevertheless probably remained the military and administrative centre of the region. After the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, the settlement became known as Legacaestir, meaning [...] "City of the Legions" [...] in Old English. Medieval chroniclers believed the church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul– later the site of Chester Cathedral– to be of Roman origin, although no evidence has been discovered to support this. When Chester became an Anglo-Saxon burh in 907, the walls of the fortress were repaired and incorporated into the defences. Much of the Roman masonry was reused in later periods.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s DMK {{continued}} its anti-Hindi policies {{along with the}} secessionist demand for Dravidistan. On 28 January 1956, Annadurai along with Periyar and Rajaji signed a resolution passed by the Academy of Tamil Culture endorsing the continuation of English as the official language. On 21 September 1957 the DMK convened an anti-Hindi Conference to protest against the imposition of Hindi. It observed 13 October 1957 as [...] "anti-Hindi Day". On 31 July 1960, another open air anti-Hindi conference was held at Kodambakkam, Madras. In November 1963, DMK dropped its secessionist demand {{in the wake of}} the Sino-Indian War and the passage of the anti-secessionist 16th Amendment to the Indian Constitution. But the anti-Hindi stance remained and hardened with the passage of Official Languages Act of 1963. The DMK's view on Hindi's qualifications for official language status were reflected in Annadurai's response to the [...] "numerical superiority of Hindi" [...] argument: [...] "If we had to accept the principle of numerical superiority while selecting our national bird, the choice <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> not on the peacock but on the common crow." ...|$|E
