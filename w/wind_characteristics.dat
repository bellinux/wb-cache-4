5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled {{a couple hundred}} miles {{southeast}} of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical <b>wind</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E

40|$|Malaysia {{intends to}} find {{alternative}} energy resources in electricity generation. Wind {{is one of}} the fastest growing resources in the world. However, initial <b>wind</b> <b>characteristic</b> study and spatial wind mapping need to be established prior to develop wind energy systems.

The aim of this study was to conduct initial <b>wind</b> <b>characteristic</b> study and spatial wind mapping in Malaysia. Wind data measured at a height of 10 m for nine selected potential sites in Malaysia were obtained from the Malaysian Meteorological Department. In this study, variations of wind speed according to height, Weibull distribution and spatial wind mapping by Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) were analyzed. The results revealed that, both wind resources at sites, Mersing and Kudat, had higher potential to develop a modern wind system. In addition, the Weibull distribution also proved that higher potential wind resources at Mersing site. Lastly, IDW spatial wind mapping showed that wind resources in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia are higher than other areas.

Then, the <b>wind</b> <b>characteristics</b> – including the mean wind speeds, turbulence intensities and mean square deviations – of the turbulent flow in the gorge terrain were studied for different included angles and different terrain heights.

The mean square deviation values of the turbulent flow at the gorge center are much smaller than those at the inlet. The effects of the terrain height on <b>wind</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity at the gorge center are very small.
