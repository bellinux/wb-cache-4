40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey was}} carried out in a sugar estate in central Ethiopia to identify a subgroup for a cohort study on the natural history of HIV infection. HIV prevalence was 2. 8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 7 %- 3. 9 %) in 957 adults aged 15 to 54 years randomly selected for the initial survey. A follow-up survey including only factory <b>workers</b> of the <b>estate</b> aged 18 to 45 years (n = 280) showed a higher HIV prevalence in male factory workers (n = 262) compared with the male <b>estate</b> <b>workers</b> of the same age of the initial survey (n = 484; 8. 8 % versus 3. 1 %; p <. 05). Factors independently associated with HIV infection in male factory workers were number of lifetime sexual partners, positive syphilis serology, higher income, and absence of travel outside the residential area. Among male <b>estate</b> <b>workers,</b> only older age was associated with HIV infection. Both factory <b>workers</b> and male <b>estate</b> <b>workers</b> were stable residents and were willing to participate in a long-term study on HIV/ AIDS. However, because of the higher HIV prevalence in factory workers and the higher prevalence of behaviors associated with an increased risk for HIV infection, factory workers were selected for the long-term cohort study on the natural history of HIV infection. Findings are reported from a study conducted at Wonji-Shao Sugar Estate, 107 km southeast of Addis Ababa, to identify a subgroup for a long-term cohort study on the natural history of HIV infection. The estate's total resident population was 24, 262 during the June 1995 census, 12, 260 of whom were adults aged 15 - 54. 2. 8 % of 957 randomly selected adults on the estate aged 15 - 54 years were infected with HIV in the initial survey conducted during November 1995 to April 1996. In a follow-up survey of Wonji factory's 262 male factory workers aged 18 - 45 years, 8. 8 % were found to be infected with HIV. Only 3. 1 % of the 484 male <b>estate</b> <b>workers</b> sampled in the initial survey were infected with HIV. HIV infection in the male factory workers was associated with the number of lifetime sex partners, positive syphilis serology, higher income, and the absence of travel outside of the residential area. Among male <b>estate</b> <b>workers,</b> only older age was associated with HIV infection. While both factory <b>workers</b> and male <b>estate</b> <b>workers</b> were stable residents and willing to participate in a long-term study of HIV/AIDS, factory workers were chosen for the long-term cohort study because of their higher prevalences of HIV infection and risk behavior...|$|R
