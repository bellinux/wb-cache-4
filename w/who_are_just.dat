5|$|John Frederick Conway's book, The Canadian Family in Crisis, explores {{effects of}} the double burden by gender. In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and {{psychological}} {{differences between men and}} women faced with the double burden in Canada. In these studies it was found that women who are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> faced with one of the two burdens.|$|E

25|$|Drum {{bags are}} made from robust cloth such as cordura or from cloth-backed vinyl. They give minimal {{protection}} from bumps and impacts, but they do protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to go to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> starting out.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the stage, many riders were trying to break away from the peloton {{to be part of the}} daily group of leaders, but in contrast to most earlier stages, it took a long time before finally a group got away from the peloton and was allowed to gain some time and distance. After the only categorized climb of the day, it's Giuseppe Guerini and David López <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> riding a few seconds in front of the peloton, followed by Jérôme Pineau, the holder of the polka dot jersey who successfully tried to enhance his lead in the king of the mountains classification. But the two leaders don't get away and at the first intermediate sprint in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul, new names pass the line first. Most important to remember is Benoit Vaugrenard winning the sprint and therefore taking 6 bonus seconds which move him past Markus Fothen in the classification for best young rider.|$|E
500|$|Espantito (Spanish for [...] "Little Terror" [...] or [...] "Little Scare"; born April 24, 1968) is {{the ring}} {{name of a}} Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked {{professional}} wrestler working in the Mini-Estrella ("Mini-Star") division. Working in the Mini-Estrella division does not automatically mean that Espetrito has Dwarfism as several wrestlers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> shorter in stature work in the [...] "Mini" [...] division. Espantito's real name {{is not a matter}} of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.|$|E
500|$|QED is {{organised}} by skeptics {{volunteers and}} any proceeds {{go back into}} the event or a charity.

Because its being run by people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> part of that community who are doing this because we really love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together. It's kind of a big party, a celebration of UK skepticism and also international skepticism".|$|E

500|$|... "Strange Ones" [...] and [...] "I'd Like To Know" [...] {{are both}} songs about the strange people on Cowley Road, Oxford. Mick Quinn tried to {{describe}} the concept: [...] "There's a few people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> really out there. There's {{a lot of people}} around Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I'm not really sure about them. I'm not really sure that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing." [...] Danny Goffey added, [...] "They're the sort of people who don't fit in anywhere, who don't link up with everyday life at all." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> starting their bands who happen {{to live in the}} canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{author and}} the series' {{popularity}} are often compared with J. K. Rowling and Harry Potter. Describing the fan following of the books, the Phoenix New Times wrote, [...] "Meyer's fandom {{is reminiscent of}} Harry Potter mania." [...] The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the [...] "spiritual successor to Harry Potter". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] I do think that we both have people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Wilkinson was an {{opponent}} of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she {{was elected to the}} Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... just as we have [...] {{opened the door to the}} older women, tonight we are opening it to those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were also}} split with their {{impressions}} of the [...] "tag" [...] system. GameShark {{found it to be}} a [...] "nice twist" [...] while RPGFan found it to be [...] "irrelevant and not good." [...] Nintendo World Report called Izuna 2 [...] "a respectable and fun dungeon-crawler" [...] marred mostly by its gameplay mechanics and disappointing graphics. They also pointed out that the game is targeted at [...] "very specific gamer crowd". Likewise, GamePro commented that the game [...] "might prove too challenging to casual DS gamers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> looking for a quick round of fun" [...] and would most likely fit best for [...] "DS owners looking for a hardcore dungeon crawling experience." [...] In spite of this, they found that the game had several notable positive aspects, including a [...] "solid" [...] control scheme and [...] "well done" [...] Japanese voice acting and English subtitling. X-Play pointed to the game's [...] "original visual style and a quirky sense of humor" [...] as characteristics that distinguished the game from roguelikes. They greatly enjoyed the dialogue and voice acting and felt that the game [...] "shouldn't get lost" [...] among other dungeon crawlers released to the DS. However, 1UP.com found that the [...] "amusingly slapstick storyline" [...] was the only point that stood out against dungeon crawlers, though the game was [...] "a considerable improvement" [...] over the original. In general, 1UP.com thought the game was [...] "a challenge meant for hardcore RPG fanatics but amusing enough that newcomers might find it worthwhile, too." [...] Likewise, IGN commented that the game would take [...] "a very specific gamer to cuddle up to this cute, comedic experience" [...] and pointed out that the game was [...] "most unlikely of sequels." [...] In contrast to 1UP.com, IGN found the game to be [...] "undoubtedly more of the same," [...] leading to the same benefits and drawbacks.|$|E

2500|$|In {{times of}} war, natural disaster, {{societal}} collapse, {{or in the}} absence of an established system of criminal justice, there may be increased incidences of extrajudicial punishment. In such circumstances, police or military personnel may be unofficially authorised to punish severely individuals involved in looting, rioting and other violent acts, especially if caught in flagrante delicto.

2500|$|An Achewood Cookbook, aimed mainly at beginners, {{in which}} the {{characters}} provide recipes and cooking advice. Onstad was frustrated by The French Laundry Cookbook, finding it [...] "essentially useless to any home cook", and wrote his own cookbook aimed at [...] "guys <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> {{out of college and}} have one pan and one electric burner". Onstad believed that doing such a task would be entertaining and challenging. Onstad visited a supermarket chain store and bought eggs, ground beef, and mustard, and created around 50 recipes based around them. The book includes recipes for cocktails, Scotch eggs, hot dogs, chicken, orzo, and other foods and drinks. Ray Smuckles presents all of the cocktails. Danielle Maestretti of Utne Reader said that the recipes range in appeal and complexity.|$|E

The tenor of the opposition attracted criticism, with some residents calling the dispute [...] "one of the ugliest displays of religious intolerance in the county's history." [...] Rabbi Rami Shapiro of Middle Tennessee State University blamed misinformation and misplaced fears, commenting that [...] "there are some <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> anti-Muslim and will do anything to keep a mosque out of their neighborhood. They really feel that Islam is a threat to America and American values." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two new {{categories}} of content were introduced during the patch cycle of Heavensward, post-launch: Exploratory Missions and Deep Dungeon. Exploratory Missions {{are designed to}} emulate the feel of [...] "first generation" [...] MMORPGs in which players hunted notorious monsters in the field with hidden spawn conditions. It also fills {{a gap in the}} game's content repertoire for huge-scale battles with extremely large numbers of players. However, it was not well-received at launch because of the simplicity of its battle mechanics, the repetitive nature of the gameplay loop, and the randomness of the loot drops which were not tied to skill or effort spent. Deep Dungeon is a roguelike randomly generated instance, inspired by Chocobo Mystery Dungeon. Yoshida wanted to allow veteran players to party with their friends <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> starting out more quickly; as such, characters are temporarily reset to level one upon entering and level quickly back to the maximum {{over the course of the}} first 50 floors. The first section is considered casual content but reaching the 200th floor is intended as a challenge for hardcore players.|$|E
