The player could also find other power-up items scattered in the arenas, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to increase the speed}} or strength of their characters, recover health points, or make aiming easier.|$|E

5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed.

5|$|On 10 October 1944 the Committee of Operations Analysts, which {{provided}} advice to USAAF commanders on suitable strategic bombardment targets, recommended that photo reconnaissance flights be conducted over Japan's main industrial areas {{as soon as}} possible to provide intelligence <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to direct raids from the Mariana Islands. These operations were to be conducted by the 3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron (3d PRS), which was the only photo reconnaissance unit in the XXI Bomber Command.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, {{because he had been}} elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for revolution—he had felt as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Castles {{served a}} range of purposes, the most {{important}} of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.|$|E

5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E
5|$|The Memphis {{relocation}} {{effort was}} led by AutoZone founder Pitt Hyde, who promised to purchase 50% of the team.

The first point on the checklist were not readable, but the last three were. At 20:27:32 the captain asked for flaps and landing gear, which were immediately deployed by the first officer and resulted in the aircraft gaining 70meters (200ft) of altitude. The landing gears were confirmed locked at 20:28:00. Four seconds later the passenger asked the captain if there were reserve systems <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> if the landing gear did not deploy properly. At this point the aircraft started the descent from 500meters (1,500ft).|$|E
5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new semi-rigid spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes in case of an emergency. Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.|$|E

There was also a section with six berths <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases.

5|$|After the Marianas {{began to}} come under attack, the United States {{military}} stepped up its raids on the Japanese-held islands <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; {{this was the first}} combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E
