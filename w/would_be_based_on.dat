Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood entered into discussions to headline the potential new series as their characters Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, respectively.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Iron Mans release, Marvel Studios {{announced that}} they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010. In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct. That same month, Justin Theroux signed to write the script, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a story written by Favreau and Downey. Theroux co-wrote Tropic Thunder, which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel. Genndy Tartakovsky storyboarded the film, and Adi Granov returned to supervise the designs for Iron Man's armor.|$|E

5|$|On January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America {{announced}} that transgender boys {{would be allowed}} to enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately. Previously, the sex listed on an applicant's birth certificate determined eligibility for these programs; going forward, the decision <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the gender listed on the application. Joe Maldonado became the first openly transgender boy to join the Scouts on February 7, 2017. In 2016, he was rejected from the Boy Scouts for being transgender, but the policy was changed after his story became nationally known.|$|E
5|$|Tiring of {{the back}} and forth, fair leaders demanded a meeting with Mint {{officials}} to settle {{the matter of the}} design. The Company was in severe financial straits, and money from the sale of the coins was needed. Leech agreed to send Barber to Chicago, where he met with the Finance Committee on September 23, 1892. It was agreed that the obverse <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the badges, and the reverse on Warner's caravel concept.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2010, Rosenberg {{had been}} {{developing}} a Jessica Jones TV series for ABC, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Alias comic book series by Brian Michael Bendis. However, later in 2012, {{it was revealed}} that ABC had passed on the series. In October 2013, following a deal made by Netflix and Marvel, the series was revived as a part of four series and one mini-series commitment in which Rosenberg was brought on to be the showrunner. In December 2014, the series had cast Krysten Ritter as Jones and revealed the official title of the series as Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones. In June 2015, Marvel revealed that the title for the series would be shortened to Marvel's Jessica Jones.|$|E

The project stalled for some time; in 2011 a re-announced version was now no longer {{a continuation of the}} original series but rather a complete remake.|$|R

5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions {{announced}} that the next film <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. It was decided beforehand the film would be a direct sequel, to exploit Bond's emotions following Vesper's death in the previous film. Just as Casino Royale theme was terrorism, the sequel focuses on environmentalism. The film was confirmed for a 2 May 2008 release date, with Craig reprising the lead role. Roger Michell, who directed Craig in Enduring Love and The Mother, was in negotiations to direct, but opted out {{because there was no}} script. Sony Entertainment vice-chairman Jeff Blake admitted a production schedule of 18 months was a very short window, and the release date was pushed back to late 2008. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade completed their draft of the script by April 2007, and Paul Haggis, who polished the Casino Royale script, began his rewrite the next month.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki {{wrote the}} script after he decided the film <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the 10-year-old {{daughter}} of his friend, associate producer Seiji Okuda, {{who came to}} visit his house each summer. At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of Spirited Away began in 2000. During production, Miyazaki realized the film would be over three hours long and decided to cut out several parts of the story. Pixar director John Lasseter, a fan of Miyazaki, was approached by Walt Disney Pictures to supervise an English-language translation for the film's North American release. Lasseter hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer of the adaptation. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.|$|E

5|$|The Albany Port District Commission is {{a public}} benefit {{corporation}} created {{by the state of}} New York to develop and manage port facilities anywhere in the cities of Albany and Rensselaer. The commission has five members, four of which are nominated by the mayor of Albany and one is nominated by the mayor of Rensselaer. The governor of New York then appoints them to three-year terms. The commissioners serve without pay, but are compensated for business related expenses. The commission {{is considered to be a}} unit of the city of Albany and is included in the city's financial statements. Any deficit in the finances of the commission are assessed against both Albany and Rensselaer. In 1932 the state decided that any deficit assessment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Albany owing 88% of the total and Rensselaer 12%. In 2005 the commission had a staff of 35 employees: eight in administrative duties, five in maintenance, and 22 as part-time security.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the successful release of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios {{announced it was}} developing a sequel, Iron Man 2. Favreau returned as director and Justin Theroux was hired to write the screenplay, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an original story by Favreau and Downey. In October 2008, Downey signed a new four-picture deal, that retroactively included the first film, to reprise his role and Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard as James Rhodes. Jackson signed on to reprise his role as Nick Fury from the Iron Man post-credits sequence in up to nine films, and Scarlett Johansson was cast as the Black Widow, {{as part of a}} multi-film commitment. Principal photography began April 6, 2009, at the Pasadena Masonic Temple in Pasadena, California. The majority of filming took place at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, California. Other locations included Edwards Air Force Base, Monaco, and the Sepulveda Dam. Iron Man 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 26, 2010, and was released internationally between April 28 and May 7 before releasing in North America on May 7.|$|E
5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without paying customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their own resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by the CAA, who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{first began}} {{exploring}} a possible live action/animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made. In March 1940, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate Andersen's fairy tales. The animated sequences <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> some of Andersen's best known works, such as The Little Mermaid, The Little Match Girl, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, The Ugly Duckling, The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, {{as it could}} not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even {{as far back as the}} 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. After the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney–Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942. Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled Hans Christian Andersen, with Danny Kaye as Andersen, Charles Vidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank Loesser penning the songs. All of Andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other Andersen fairy tales (including The Little Mermaid), were shelved.|$|E
