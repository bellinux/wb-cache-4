25|$|Energy {{development}} is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional, alternative and renewable sources of energy, and for the recovery and reuse of energy {{that would otherwise be}} <b>wasted.</b> <b>Energy</b> conservation and efficiency measures reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to environmental issues.|$|E
25|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{may also}} be used to increase fuel efficiency without increasing power. This is achieved by recovering waste energy in the exhaust and feeding it back into the engine intake. By using this otherwise <b>wasted</b> <b>energy</b> to increase the mass of air, it becomes easier to ensure that all fuel is burned before being vented {{at the start of the}} exhaust stage. The increased temperature from the higher pressure gives a higher Carnot efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In an {{electric}} power system, a load {{with a low}} power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor {{for the same amount}} of useful power transferred. The higher currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system, and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and <b>wasted</b> <b>energy,</b> electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers where there is a low power factor.|$|E

25|$|Second, heat {{transfer}} from exhaust {{to the vehicle}} seems likely to transfer enormous <b>wasted</b> <b>energy</b> into the ship (e.g. for 0.1g ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding were provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.|$|E
25|$|In an {{isothermal}} compression process, the {{gas in the}} system is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange {{can be achieved by}} heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid <b>wasted</b> <b>energy,</b> the intercoolers must be optimised for high heat transfer and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate {{isothermal compression}} even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.|$|E
25|$|Around 1873 {{the firm}} {{supplied}} two blowing engines {{to the huge}} Krupp steelworks at Essen, Germany. It was in this decade that the company began to install flat belt drive systems for the transfer of power from its stationary steam engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. This technique was common in the US but rare in Britain until this time: the advantages included less noise and less <b>wasted</b> <b>energy</b> in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, {{and it was a}} more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.|$|E

A practical testing rig was designed and constructed to verify the reliability and consistency of data for the both selection and optimization techniques.

25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability {{to find its}} {{way back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the <b>wasted</b> <b>energy</b> that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E

Every model came with a 5-speed manual gearbox until 2011, when 6-speed manual and automatic (EGS6) manual versions were introduced, along with an eco-friendly start-stop system and regenerative braking technology in certain models, notably the Exclusive and Tendance models for the German market. According to Citroën, these two new features reduce [...] emissions significantly and their introduction coincided with the release of a higher specification Airdream engine, the European emission standards (Euro 5) carbon dioxide emissions limits were lowered and the addition of low-rolling resistance tyres were added to the entire range. The tyres are specially designed to minimize <b>wasted</b> <b>energy</b> when the tyre rolls and have been estimated by the California Energy Commission to save 1.5–4.5% of fuel in a typical car.|$|E
