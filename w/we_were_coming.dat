500|$|... "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] {{was written}} by Scott M. Gimple and {{directed}} by Michelle MacLaren. It features recurring appearances from Lauren Cohan, Scott Wilson, IronE Singleton, Madison Lintz, Emily Kinney, Jane McNeill, James Allen McCune, and Amber Chaney. Following the initial broadcast of the previous installment, [...] "Secrets", writer Robert Kirkman teased the following episode [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already". He stated: [...] "There's {{a lot of big}} stuff out there that we will be wrapping up to a certain extent. In the writers' room we were fully aware that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> up on this hiatus, so we definitely wrote to it. I {{think people are going to}} be a little shocked." ...|$|E
500|$|Grunge {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in the United Kingdom after Pavitt and Poneman asked journalist Everett True from the British magazine Melody Maker to write {{an article on the}} local music scene. This exposure helped to make grunge known outside of the local area during the late 1980s and drew more people to local shows. The appeal of grunge to the music press was that it [...] "promised the return to a notion of a regional, authorial vision for American rock". Grunge's popularity in the underground music scene was such that bands began to move to Seattle and approximate the look and sound of the original grunge bands. Mudhoney's Steve Turner said, [...] "It was really bad. Pretend bands were popping up here, things weren't coming from where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> from." [...] As a reaction, many grunge bands diversified their sound, with Nirvana and Tad in particular creating more melodic songs. Dawn Anderson of the Seattle fanzine Backlash recalled that by 1990 many locals had tired of the hype surrounding the Seattle scene and hoped that media exposure had dissipated.|$|E

500|$|Holy Wood debuted and {{peaked at}} number 13 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 117,279—an initial {{commercial}} disappointment. It spent 13 consecutive {{weeks on the}} chart before dropping off – far short of the 52 and 33 weeks Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals spent on the chart, respectively – making it the shortest-charting full-length LP by the band until The High End of Low (2009). It took over two years to be certified gold by the RIAA (in March 2003), denoting shipments in excess of 500,000 units. As of 2010, the album has sold over 573,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Manson attributed its lack of commercial appeal to the musical climate of the time, and argued that, {{at the height of the}} band's popularity, their US album sales peaked between one and two million units, so [...] "it's not such a disaster as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> down from seven or eight million records." [...] He also said that the drop in US sales was off-set by increasing international success.|$|E

This {{was on top}} of their own personal weapon and ammunition. Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret. No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were [...] "just swilling around in the water." [...] Captain McDougal later wrote, [...] "as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was the man next to him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire." [...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their rucksacks behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.|$|E

Often times, she remembered the video that they were seeing was [...] "Whatta Man", however, during their interview with MTV in 1995, the show cited [...] "None of Your Business", a video which was also done by Rolston and had more visual similarities to the final [...] "Creep" [...] video. Lopes also recalled the moment: [...] "We were very, very adamant about redoing the 'Creep' video because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> back out [...] And we were like, 'Look at that video Salt-N-Pepa got. Man, we're going to kick nobody's butts putting these videos out. [...] is budi, [...] is whack, we've got to do it over.'" [...] Their management team then suggested going back to the editing room to find better shots and have the video redone, but group declined and said: [...] "There is no better shot." [...] Initially, TLC reached out to Rolston and set up the third version's shooting in LA.|$|E

500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk when I wrote that episode. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at the time and I brought my irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

2500|$|Gouldman, in a 1995 interview, was {{philosophical}} {{about the}} album: [...] "When we finally did {{come back to}} record again, {{it was based on}} market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong." [...] Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. [...] "We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs.

Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs as we used to, but me and Jim knew that we were, we knew that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E

We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy.

The Kooks recorded an EP demo, sending it out in search of gigs; they instead received offers from managers and record companies. The band had only been together as a group for four months when they signed with Virgin Records, after being spotted by several label scouts at the Brighton Free Butt Festival in 2005.
