5|$|By {{early on}} October 9, the {{depression}} {{consisted of a}} circulation center <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated deep convection {{that is one of}} the prerequisites of being a tropical cyclone. Several hurricane forecast models predicted Kyle to weaken until dissipation. After 24hours without significant convection, thunderstorms reformed to the southeast of the center on October 10 as the depression entered an area of warmer water temperatures. Environmental conditions became more favorable, with weakening wind shear and decreasing dry air. The depression continued tracking around a ridge, turning to the west and west-northwest toward the coast of Florida. Convection increased markedly early on October 11 as it turned northward ahead of an approaching cold front, and Kyle regained tropical storm status about 35miles (60km) east of the border between Florida and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Colley Cibber was {{a rather}} {{unsuccessful}} young actor {{at the time of}} the split, with a squeaky voice and <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of Love's Last Shift, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of The Relapse could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in Love's Last Shift. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.|$|E

25|$|The new, '{{national}} revolutionary' profile {{proved to}} be a non-starter for the electoral work of the party. For example, Niekisch's national revolutionary line had alienated the trade unionists in the textile industry, whom initially had supported the party. With their departure from the party, it lost whatever influence in the labour movement it once had. The party got 65,573 votes in the 1928 Reichtag election, but no seats. 35,000 of the votes had come from Saxony. After the election a new party programme was adopted, <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'national revolutionary' references.|$|E

As such, the dam was designed <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> additional benefits given by the arch action, which led to its profile being considered conservative given its size.|$|E
25|$|Hackett's {{first major}} shift in musical style came with 1981's Cured.

While Cured did not chart highly in the US, it peaked at no.15 in the UK. Several of his first solo albums also charted in Europe – especially in Scandinavian countries, where his first four post-Genesis solo albums all entered Top 30 on the album charts.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposed}} {{alternative to}} the City Rail Link (CRL) to increase capacity was the duplication of the existing eastern Britomart approach tunnel. This would have required a new twin track tunnel approximately 500 metres long to be constructed parallel to the existing twin-track tunnel, resulting in four tracks from Quay Park Junction and retaining Britomart as a terminus. Estimated costs were $150 million to $200 million, with 4–5 years to plan and build. Such a project would have allowed the same capacity increase as the CRL at approximately one sixth to one fifth the cost, but <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> additional benefits that the two new CRL underground stations or the more direct route to the Western Line will provide.|$|E
