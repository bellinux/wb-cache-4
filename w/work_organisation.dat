Three years later, the American Psychological Association (APA) and NIOSH jointly organized the first international Work, Stress, and Health conference in Washington, DC. The conference has since become a biannual OHP meeting. In 1996, the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology was published by APA. That same year, the International Commission on Occupational Health created the <b>Work</b> <b>Organisation</b> and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS) scientific committee, which focused primarily on OHP. In 1999, the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology (EA-OHP) was established at the first European Workshop on Occupational Health Psychology in Lund, Sweden. That workshop {{is considered to be}} the first EA-OHP conference, the first of a continuing series of conferences EA-OHP organizes and devotes to OHP research and practice.|$|E

40|$|The NQSF is {{intended}} to be both practical and developmental, in that it will enable youth <b>work</b> <b>organisations</b> to assess service provision and to identify areas for development. As engagement in the NQSF is a continuous process, it is not expected that all organisations will be able to immediately and fully achieve all the standards as set out in this document. Neither is it the intention that the NQSF would require uniformity of provision. Rather, it aims to ensure that youth work providers continue to offer a rich and varied service, and commit to a process of continuous development through engagement in the NQSF. The NQSF is primarily a support and development tool for youth <b>work</b> <b>organisations.</b> Self-assessment is fundamental to the process. In addition, there is also an external assessment function, which serves to validate the self-assessment process and which is performed by VEC (Youth/Liaison) Officers for local youth work services or by the NQSF Standards Officer for national youth <b>work</b> <b>organisations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research {{shows that}} {{participation}} in sport is positively related to self-esteem, self-regulation skills, and social inclusion. As socially vulnerable youngsters participate less frequently in sports activities than their average peers, youth <b>work</b> <b>organisations</b> try to guide their clients (i. e., socially vulnerable youngsters) to local sports clubs and inclusive sports activities. Inclusive sports activities, however, cannot be provided by youth <b>work</b> <b>organisations</b> alone. Therefore, in the Netherlands, intersectoral action involving both youth <b>work</b> <b>organisations</b> and local sports clubs has emerged. Because youth workers and stakeholders in local sports clubs {{are not used to}} collaborating with each other, we explored the factors that contribute to the quality and performance of such intersectoral actions. On the basis of five open interviews with youth workers and three focus groups with stakeholders in local sports clubs, we described factors relating to the organisation of intersectoral action among youth workers and local sports clubs that are preconditions for the success of this specific type of intersectoral action...|$|R

Based {{on the findings of}} the study, the authors recommended that democratic management style should be encouraged as conflict resolution strategy in order to guarantee effective management of industrial conflict and sustainable peace and harmony.
