5|$|Idiophones, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> sound by {{vibrating}} {{the primary}} {{body of the}} instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as claves, xylophone, guiro, slit drum, mbira, and rattle.|$|E
5|$|Sachs later added a fifth category, electrophones, such as theremins, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> sound by {{electronic}} means. Within {{each category}} are many subgroups. The {{system has been}} criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by ethnomusicologists and organologists.|$|E

50|$|Gold {{production}} {{had slowed}} by 1906, but as mining technology improved, additional amounts {{began to be}} extracted from the area. Gold mining in the Wawa area prospered and receded {{several times in the}} 20th century, and it continues today. Notable producers include the Grace Mine (1902-1944), <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> 15,191 ounces, the Minto Mine (1929-1942), <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> 37,678 ounces, the Parkhill Mine (1902-1944), <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> 54,301 ounces, and the Renabie Mine (1920-1991), <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> 1.1 million ounces.|$|R

5|$|Several related medical {{conditions}} involve sebum—including acne, sebaceous cysts, hyperplasia, and sebaceous adenoma. These are usually attributable to overactive sebaceous glands, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> excess sebum.|$|E
5|$|Aerophones, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> a {{sound with}} a {{vibrating}} column of air; they {{are sorted into}} free aerophones such as a bullroarer or whip, which move freely through the air; flutes, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{have been}} made by the Food and Agricultural Organization to improve {{relations}} between farmers, agro-pastoralists and pastoralists in the Zakouma National Park (ZNP), Siniaka-Minia, and Aouk reserve in southeastern Chad to promote sustainable development. As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which incidentally also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> gum arabic, and also from fruit trees.|$|E
25|$|Norisoprenoids-Carotenoid derived {{aromatic}} {{compounds that}} includes megastigmatrienone <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> {{some of the}} spice notes associated with Chardonnay and zingerone responsible for the different spice notes associated with Syrah.

5|$|Florida International University {{ecologist}} Suzanne Koptur {{reported the}} presence of extrafloral nectaries on F. aurea figs in the Florida Everglades. Extrafloral nectaries are structures <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> nectar but are not associated with flowers. They are usually interpreted as defensive structure and are often produced in response to attack by insect herbivores. They attract insects, primarily ants, which defend the nectaries, thus protecting the plant against herbivores.|$|E
5|$|It is {{classified}} as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities <b>which</b> <b>produce,</b> store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|Membranophones, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> sound by a {{vibrating}} a stretched membrane; {{they may}} be drums (further sorted by {{the shape of the}} shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but kazoos and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{is found}} in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is not {{threatened by}} human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American goldfinch. Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the American goldfinch {{both as a}} short-distance migrant, and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> the primary food source of the American goldfinch.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of {{railroad}} worms (Phrixothrix) have paired photic organs on each body segment, able to glow with green light; these {{are thought to}} have a defensive purpose. They also have organs on the head <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> red light; they are the only terrestrial organisms to emit light of this colour.|$|E
50|$|The {{three most}} popular beer {{producers}} in Vietnam are: Sabeco Brewery, <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> Saigon Beer and 33 Beer; Vietnam Brewery Ltd, a joint-venture of Heineken Asia Pacific and Saigon Trading Group (Satra), <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> Heineken, Tiger Beer and Larue Beer; and Habeco, <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> Hanoi Beer and Truc Bach Beer. Out of those three, Saigon Beer {{is the most}} popular, {{according to data from}} 2013. One of their trademark beers is the 333 Lager. Other popular breweries include Hue Brewery Ltd, <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> Huda Beer and Dai Viet, which is the only commercial brewery in Vietnam that produces black beer.|$|R
50|$|Thus, the new {{strategy}} was {{to focus on a}} broader segment by investing in various companies across sectors. This strategy was initiated in 1939 with the investment in the battery factory Hellesens. Over the following decades, The Great Northern Telegraph Company balanced between investing in the telecommunications industry and other industries. On the industry side, it invested in companies such as Lauritz Knudsen, <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> electrical goods, and in 1947, the radiotelephone production company Storno (a contraction of Store Nordiske (Great Northern)) was founded. Other acquisitions were Telematic <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> telephones, Elmi <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> measuring equipment and Danavox <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> hearing aids.|$|R
5000|$|Early Spanish {{accounts}} {{describe the}} Tagalogs as using local plants to dye their cotton clothing. [...] This included tayum or tagum, <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> a blue dye, and dilao, <b>which</b> <b>produced</b> a yellow dye.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} by decomposing and digesting organic matter—and grows in clusters or in groups on decaying leaf litter or well-decayed wood. It typically fruits {{in a narrow}} window from June to July; this {{spring and early summer}} fruiting distinguishes it from the more common Coprinus comatus and Coprinopsis atramentaria, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> fruit bodies in late autumn. It is found in the United States, in areas east of the Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Atlas {{owns and}} {{operates}} the Baranovichi Machine-Tool Plant (<b>which</b> <b>produces</b> compressors, technological systems for plastics processing, and conveyor systems) and the Household Appliances Plant (<b>which</b> <b>produces</b> washing machines and other electrical appliances).|$|R
5|$|The {{reaction}} {{has been}} used in a number of notable total syntheses including the Danishefsky Taxol total synthesis, <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> the chemotherapeutic drug taxol, and the Kuehne Strychnine total synthesis <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> the pesticide strychnine.|$|R

5|$|Chordophones, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; {{they are}} sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus (commonly {{known as}} the grey milkcap) is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae, first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries. It produces moderately sized and brittle mushrooms, which grow {{on the forest floor}} or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex cap can vary in shape, sometimes forming the shape of a wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured gills, <b>which</b> <b>produce</b> white milk. The spore print is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. L.vietus feeds by forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours birch. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.|$|E

60|$|Property may {{be divided}} {{generally}} into two kinds; that <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> life, and that <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> {{the objects of}} life. That <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> or maintains life consists of food, {{in so far as}} it is nourishing; of furniture and clothing, in so far as they are protective or cherishing; of fuel; and of all land, instruments, or materials necessary to produce food, houses, clothes, and fuel. It is specially and rightly called useful property.|$|R
50|$|Other notable Pseudomonas {{species with}} {{biocontrol}} properties include P. chlororaphis, <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> a phenazine-type antibiotic active agent against certain fungal plant pathogens, and the {{closely related species}} P. aurantiaca, <b>which</b> <b>produces</b> di-2,4-diacetylfluoroglucylmethane, a compound antibiotically active against Gram-positive organisms.|$|R
