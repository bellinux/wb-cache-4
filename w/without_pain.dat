40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the range of motion (ROM) and {{strength}} of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints among massage practitioners with and <b>without</b> thumb <b>pain</b> and control subjects. Sixteen massage practitioners with thumb <b>pain,</b> 16 practitioners <b>without</b> thumb <b>pain,</b> and 16 control subjects participated in this study. ROM of flex-ion, extension, and abduction in the MP joint; ROM of flexion and extension in the IP joint of the thumb; strength of the flexor pollicis brevis (FPB), extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis longus (FPL), and extensor pollicis longus measured in all subjects. ROM of extension and abduction in the MP joint were significantly increased in massage practitioners with and <b>without</b> thumb <b>pain</b> compared with control subjects. ROM of extension in the IP joint was sig-nificantly increased in massage practitioners with thumb pain compared with those <b>without</b> thumb <b>pain.</b> The strength of the EPB and FPL muscle was significantly decreased in massage practitioners with thumb pain compared with those <b>without</b> thumb <b>pain</b> and control subjects, respectively. In ad-dition, there was significantly increased EPB/FPB strength in massage practitioners <b>without</b> thumb <b>pain</b> compared to those with thumb pain and control subjects...|$|R

While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury <b>without</b> <b>pain,</b> making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death <b>without</b> <b>pain</b> or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

25|$|Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage {{or damage}} to tissue. The {{three types of}} pain receptors are {{cutaneous}} (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research {{in the first half}} of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. <b>Without</b> <b>pain,</b> people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.|$|E
25|$|The MCC played New South Wales {{immediately}} before the Fifth Test and it rained, as {{in every other}} match on their tour. The ground staff ran on to cover the MCC-NSW wicket and left the Test wicket under the rain. As a result, it was over-watered and while not dangerous it favoured the bowlers and produced the best cricket of the series. Len Hutton was sent to hospital after being hit on the chin by a Ginty Lush bouncer in that match, but returned to make 40 and 74. Jack Fingleton called on Lindwall and Miller to not subject him to another fast bowling barrage, which could damage his weakened left arm and end his career.

40|$|Introduction: There are {{conflicting}} data on patient characteristics and outcomes of myocardial infarction (MI) patients presenting {{with and without}} the symptom of chest pain. Objectives: Compare the characteristics and survival of patients stratified by the symptom chest pain. Methods: This retrospective cohort study identified patients with an emergency department discharge diagnosis of MI, who arrived by ambulance at a teaching hospital in Perth, Western Australia, between January 2008 to October 2009. The cohort was linked to hospital data and the state-based death register; clinical data were extracted by medical record review. Patient characteristics were compared using logistic regression models and survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. Results: Of 382 patients, 26 % presented <b>without</b> chest <b>pain.</b> The odds of presenting <b>without</b> chest <b>pain</b> were increased if aged 80 + (OR 7. 54; 95 %CI 2. 81 - 20. 3) and aged 70 - 79 years (OR 4. 33; 95 % CI 1. 50 - 12. 5), and female (OR 1. 67; 95 %CI 0. 99 - 2. 82).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{differences}} in the ability to perform various activities of daily living (ADLs) among groups with various knee problems. The participants consisted of 328 elderly females (age 60 - 94; mean age 76. 1 years; standard deviation 6. 2). The subjects were classified into three groups: those <b>without</b> knee <b>pain,</b> those with mild knee pain, and those with severe knee pain. ADLs with markedly higher (> 97 %) and lower (< 38 %) achievement rates in the group <b>without</b> knee <b>pain</b> were not significantly different among the three groups. Achievement rates of 40 %- 97 % for ADLs were significantly lower in the group with severe knee pain than in the group <b>without</b> knee <b>pain.</b> In addition, the groups with mild and severe knee pain demonstrated significantly lower achievement rates of ascending and descending stairs and sitting up than the group <b>without</b> knee <b>pain.</b> In conclusion, regardless of the presence of absence of mild or severe knee pain, some ADLs are difficult to achieve, while others are easy. The elderly with severe knee pain find it difficult to achieve many ADLs. In addition, it is difficult for the elderly with mild and severe knee pain to ascend and descend stairs and to sit up. © 2013 Hiroki Sugiura and Shinichi Demura...|$|R
