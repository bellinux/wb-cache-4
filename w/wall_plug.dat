5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} utility {{resources are}} significantly larger for EUV compared to 193nm immersion, even with two exposures using the latter. Hynix {{reported at the}} 2009 EUV Symposium that the <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> efficiency was ~0.02% for EUV, i.e., to get 200 W at intermediate focus for 100 WPH, one would require 1MW of input power, compared to 165kW for an ArF immersion scanner, and that even at the same throughput, the footprint of the EUV scanner was ~3x the footprint of an ArF immersion scanner, resulting in productivity loss. Additionally, to confine ion debris, a superconducting magnet may be required.|$|E
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and <b>wall</b> <b>plug.</b> In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|E

50|$|Before {{commercial}} <b>wall</b> <b>plugs,</b> fixings {{were made}} to brick or masonry walls by chiselling a groove into a soft mortar joint, hammering in a crude wooden plug and then attaching to the wooden plug. This was time consuming and required a large hole, thus more patching of the wall afterwards. It also limited the holes' location to the mortar joints.|$|R

50|$|The Heated Towel Rack - The contestants must {{install a}} ground fault circuit {{interrupter}} outlet, {{in order to}} install a heated towel rack in their bathrooms. Rob, Matt and Charlene have no problems replacing the original outlet with the GFCI outlet; Dan is momentarily delayed by his color blindness, requiring Natasha to assist him in connecting the wires, while Ajay fails to comprehend the lesson and has to solicit Matt's advice to correctly hook up the outlet. Rob doesn't have any further issues in installing his rack, and passes in short order. Dan has trouble anchoring the towel rack to the wall due to trouble with the <b>wall</b> <b>plugs</b> and stripping screws, but otherwise passes. Charlene fails after failing to drill pilot holes to anchor in the screws and wearing out her screws. Ajay's rack is mounted, but he destroys his drill bit in making pilot holes and he cuts off his <b>wall</b> <b>plugs</b> after failing to fully recess them, so he fails. Matt also admits defeat without installing the towel rack after spending 80 minutes trying to install the anchors, compared to the 5 that he took to change the outlet.|$|R
