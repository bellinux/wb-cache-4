500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{stated that}} he wanted an [...] "epic" [...] quality to the Christmas special.

[...] Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen {{at the onset of the}} episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) in 2005. He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s, but rejected by the production team at the time. Continuing the theme introduced with the series' first five episodes, [...] "The Snowmen" [...] was promoted like a movie. A movie poster was released in the Radio Times, showing the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladder to the TARDIS.|$|E

500|$|As the {{recording}} sessions progressed, Wim Wenders approached {{the band and}} asked them for a song for his next film, Faraway, So Close!. The Edge said [...] "we heard Wim Wenders {{was looking for a}} song... so I had a go at finishing it." [...] U2 watched the film, Faraway, So Close!, for inspiration on how to craft the song. Bono said [...] "the film was about angels who want to be human and who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> Earth. But to do so they have to become mortal. That was a great image to play with- the impossibility of wanting something like this, and then the cost of having it." [...] Two versions of the song were crafted; the first was released on Zooropa, and the second, almost two minutes longer and featuring [...] "an edgier guitar and drum performance," [...] was included on the Faraway, So Close! soundtrack. Close to the completion of {{the recording}} Bono renamed the song [...] "Stay." [...] Wanting to further reference the Wenders film he then changed it once more, to [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home! Why do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following {{the release of the}} album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him.

[...] Bunmi Mojekwu, who plays Mercy Olubunmi, commented [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square – a dream come true – I'm enjoying every second." [...] Sam Attwater, who previously appeared in five episodes of Hollyoaks, was cast as boxer Leon Small. On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches.

500|$|Recording of {{the tracks}} that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy {{with the results of}} the Norton {{sessions}} with Palmer playing drums. Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him {{from the rest of the}} band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, [...] "We just found it all ridiculous. He had people running around behind him, basically wiping his arse." [...] McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview: [...] "I knew I was losing it. I was on another planet but then I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the one [...] were on." ...|$|E

Instead of their names being George, he called everybody by their first name. He always had like a piano in the car and they sang and danced and had a great time.
