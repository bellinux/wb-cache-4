25|$|Translations do not {{fold back}} on themselves, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> integer {{multiples}} of any finite translation, or sums of multiples of two such independent translations, as a subgroup. These generate the lattice of a periodic tiling of the plane.|$|E
25|$|Usually a {{constant}} is included {{as one of}} the regressors. For example, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> x'i1=1 for i=1,...,n. The corresponding element of β is called the intercept. Many statistical inference procedures for linear models require an intercept to be present, so it is often included even if theoretical considerations suggest that its value should be zero.|$|E
25|$|A {{shrinking}} argument also eliminates 5-fold symmetry. Consider {{a regular}} pentagon of lattice points. If it exists, then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> every other edge displacement and (head-to-tail) assemble a 5-point star, {{with the last}} edge returning to the starting point. The vertices of such a star are again vertices of a regular pentagon with 5-fold symmetry, but about 60% smaller than the original.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, if E is any exact {{category}}, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> A to be {{the category}} of left-exact functors from E {{into the category of}} abelian groups, which is itself abelian and in which E is a natural subcategory (via the Yoneda embedding, since Hom is left exact), stable under extensions, and in which a sequence is in E if and only if it is exact in A.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{that some}} {{observer}} rotates with {{constant angular velocity}} about some axis. Then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the two fixed points to be the North and South poles of the celestial sphere. The appearance {{of the night sky}} is now transformed continuously in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of elliptic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, ∞, and with the number α corresponding to the constant angular velocity of our observer.|$|E
25|$|Not every {{conjecture}} ends {{up being}} proven true or false. The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be undecidable (or independent) from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (much as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> Euclid's parallel postulate as either true or false).|$|E

25|$|The {{reliability}} of decoding can be low since {{the degree of}} freedom is not increased by signal relaying. There is no increase in the diversity order since this scheme exploits only the relayed signal and the direct signal from the source node is either not available or is not accounted for. When <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> advantage of such a signal and increase in diversity order results. Thus, in the following we consider the cooperative scheme which decodes the combined signal of both the direct and relayed signals.|$|E
25|$|This {{statement}} of the mean value property can be generalized as follows: If h is any spherically symmetric function supported in B(x,r) such that ∫h = 1, then u(x) = h * u(x). In other words, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the weighted average of u about a point and recover u(x). In particular, by taking h to be a C∞ function, we can recover the value of u at any point even if we only know how u acts as a distribution. See Weyl's lemma.|$|E
25|$|The way Kant {{suggests}} that we should deal with this dialectic is through {{an appeal to the}} two perspectives <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, we are free, whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine everything that happens. There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of the laws of nature determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.|$|E

25|$|On Blanshard's view, the Absolute is {{thus not}} merely {{consistent}} (i.e., noncontradictory) but positively coherent, {{shot through with}} relations of necessity and indeed operating purely deterministically. (Blanshard held the law of causality, properly understood, to be a logical law and believed that effects logically determine their causes as well as vice versa.) Strictly speaking, he admitted, we cannot prove {{that there are no}} atomic facts, bare conjunctions, or sheer surds in nature, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> it as our working hypothesis that relations of necessity are always to be found; until and unless this hypothesis meets with absolute defeat, we are justified in adopting it at least provisionally.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} for addition works {{except in a}} few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is {{when one of the}} points is O. Here, we define P + O = P = O + P, making O the identity of the group. Next, if P and Q are opposites of each other, we define P + Q = O. Lastly, if P = Q we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point R and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> its opposite. However, if P happens to be an inflection point (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take R to be P itself and P + P is simply the point opposite itself.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir Putin, {{it was not}} you {{who started}} this war. But you can finish it if you have enough courage and {{determination}} of de Gaulle. We offer you a sensible peace based on mutual benefit by the principle independence in exchange for security. In case of troops withdrawal and acknowledgement of independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, we are obliged not to make any political, military, or economic treaties with anyone against Russia, not to accommodate foreign military bases on our territory even temporarily, not to support and not to finance groups or organizations carrying out a military struggle against RF, {{to be present in}} the united ruble zone, to enter CIS. Besides, we can sign a treaty even though a neutral state status is more acceptable to us. We can also guarantee a renunciation of armed struggle against RF by all Muslims of Russia for at least 10 to 15 years under condition of freedom of faith. We are not related to the apartment bombings in Moscow and Volgodonsk, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for this in an acceptable way.|$|E

25|$|John Stuart Mill, the English thinker and politician, began a {{formative}} year visiting France {{at the age}} of 14 with {{a two-week}} stay at Pompignan in June 1820. In long letters to his father (who financed the educational trip), the precocious Mill details his extensive reading in the library of the chateau, including almost one work per day by Voltaire, Lefranc's main enemy, without once referring to the marquis' own works. Even by then something of a connoisseur of gardens, he walked in what he called the 'pleasure grounds' of the chateau almost every day, and sometimes to the plateau above (whose views he was to recall later, in other works), without ever giving any detail on the park itself. Mills was in Pompignan as a guest of Samuel Bentham, who was renting a property in the grounds, giving weight to the belief that the marquis (the second) was impecunious at that point. But <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> it that the garden must have been in good order during Mill's visit, or he would have remarked on it.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{predicted}} in January 1966 {{that the various}} boycotts would force Smith to give in [...] "within {{a matter of weeks}} rather than months", but the British (and later UN) sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with it, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with opprobrium, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. [...] "Rhodesia can not only take it, but she can also make it," [...] Smith said on 29 April 1966, while opening the annual Central African Trade Fair in Bulawayo. [...] "When I say take it, I use it in two ways. Firstly, when it comes to sanctions we have proved <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> it. Secondly, when it comes to independence, we have also proved <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> it." ...|$|E

As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'.
