[...] It was all spur of the moment, man". [...] Over two days at Chess, a backing track was completed and the Yardbirds continued their American concert tour. [...] Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, the group resumed recording at Columbia studios on 7 January and at RCA studios on 10 January 1966. [...] Singer Keith Relf contributed lyrics and a melody for the song.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{there were}} {{concerns}} over the fleet's capable lifespan. Several projects beyond the B-52, the Convair B-58 Hustler and North American XB-70 Valkyrie, had either been aborted or proved disappointing in light of changing requirements, which left the older B-52 as the main bomber {{as opposed to the}} planned successive aircraft models. On 19 February 1965, General Curtis E. LeMay testified to Congress that the lack of a follow-up bomber project to the B-52 raised the danger that, [...] "The B-52 is going to fall apart on us before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> replacement for it." [...] Other aircraft, such as the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, later complemented the B-52 in roles the aircraft was not as capable in, such as missions involving high-speed, low-level penetration dashes.|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{supported}} {{a group of}} three budget reform bills that were considered by the House during the 113th United States Congress. He supported H.R. 1874, the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013, which would have required the Congressional Budget Office to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect. He also supported H.R. 1872, the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, which would have modified the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, including requiring the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. [...] He also supported H.R. 1871, the Baseline Reform Act of 2013, which would have discontinued the practice of automatic increases for inflation in projecting discretionary appropriations in CBO's baseline budgeting. Arguing in favor of H.R. 1871, Ryan said that [...] "families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington". He said that these three budget reform bills [...] "are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington". Ryan claimed that [...] "by improving the budget process, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better handle on our spending problem". The three budget reform bills passed the House and died in the Senate budget committee.|$|E

500|$|Legion {{was filmed}} with Arri Alexa cameras, with two Alexa XT cameras and an Alexa Mini {{used for the}} pilot and then Minis used {{for the rest of}} the season; the footage was {{captured}} in 4K Ultra-high-definition. Gonzales described the series as [...] "essentially a one-camera show", but [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bonus view [...] that doesn’t compromise the look of A-camera, that’s great." [...] Lenses for the series were a mixture of spherical and anamorphic, including a 9.8 Kinoptik camera lens to film [...] "some of the more bizarre mindscapes", which Kubrick used to film A Clockwork Orange. The Kinoptik lenses caused vignetting, which Gonzales would crop out of the image in post-production, though sometimes [...] "we just left it" [...] to add character. The series changes aspect ratio to reflect Haller's state of mind, [...] "going narrower when he feels boxed in by the nefarious forces pursuing him", though Gonzales [...] "didn’t always want the anamorphics to make the audience feel this big jump, but I wanted these subtle differences like the background bokeh to be a little different." [...] The season's [...] "memory work" [...] sequences were filmed with anamorphic lenses, but were then cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Gonzales and Hawley both [...] "don’t care too much for" [...] steadicams, and instead relied on jib arms, dollies, and 30-foot technocranes, both on set and location. The production also made extensive use of a Ronin camera stabilizer, allowing the camera to be moved around by camera men and transitioned between hand use and cranes without endangering the camera operators.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps more clearly, {{the method}} can be {{explained}} in terms of Boolean-valued models. In these, any statement is assigned a truth value from some complete atomless Boolean algebra, rather than just a true/false value. Then an ultrafilter is picked in this Boolean algebra, which assigns values true/false to statements of our theory. The point is that the resulting theory has a model which contains this ultrafilter, which can be understood as a new model obtained by extending the old one with this ultrafilter. By picking a Boolean-valued model in an appropriate way, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> model that has the desired property. In it, only statements which must be true (are [...] "forced" [...] to be true) will be true, in a sense (since it has this extension/minimality property).|$|E
