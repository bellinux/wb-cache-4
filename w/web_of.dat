40|$|Abstract. <b>Webs</b> <b>of</b> trust {{constitute}} a decentralized infrastructure for establishing {{the authenticity of}} the binding between public keys and users and, more generally, trust relationships among users. This paper introduces the concept <b>of</b> anonymous <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> trust – an extension <b>of</b> <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> trust where users can authenticate messages and determine each other’s trust level without compromising their anonymity. Our framework comprises a novel cryptographic protocol based on zero-knowledge proofs, a symbolic abstraction and formal verification of our protocol, and a prototypical implementation based on the OpenPGP standard. The framework is capable of dealing with various core and optional features <b>of</b> common <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> trust, such as key attributes, key expiration dates, existence of multiple certificate chains, and trust measures between different users. ...|$|R

5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile <b>web</b> <b>of</b> relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a <b>web</b> <b>of</b> powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following {{over the next}} few months. Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of The <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Fear was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly.

5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a <b>web</b> <b>of</b> laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station. At the unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential <b>web</b> <b>of</b> beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} rumours, in October 2013 a BBC press conference {{announced}} {{the return of}} 11 episodes (two of which previously existing) from a television relay station {{in the city of}} Jos, Nigeria. In the course of his work abroad, Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1-6 of The Enemy of the World and episodes 1-6 of The <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Fear. and returned 11 of these to the BBC. The return of the nine missing episodes was the single largest recovery of Doctor Who episodes in 25 years, resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton's first two seasons to be restored to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a <b>web</b> <b>of</b> life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Bahraini {{scientists}} published 155 {{articles in}} internationally cataloged journals, according to Thomson Reuters' <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This corresponds to 15 articles per million inhabitants, {{compared to a}} global average of 176 per million inhabitants in 2013.

5|$|In 2014, Malawian {{scientists}} had the third-largest output in Southern Africa, {{in terms of}} articles catalogued in international journals.

Only South Africa (9,309) and the United Republic of Tanzania (770) published more in Southern Africa. Malawian scientists publish more in mainstream journals – relative to GDP – {{than any other country}} of a similar population size. This is impressive, even if the country's publication density remains modest, with just 19 publications per million inhabitants catalogued in international journals in 2014.

40|$|Three-point flexure {{tests on}} the <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> 12 {{pultruded}} Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) Wide Flange (WF) specimens are described. The <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> the specimens were tested with their ends either simply or semi-rigidly supported. Dual knife-edge fixtures and rigid steel supports were designed and fabricated to simulate these support conditions. A series of low load tests were carried out on the <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> the WF specimens for both types of end conditions and deflections and strains were recorded at mid-span. Using simple beam analysis models {{in conjunction with the}} test data, both the transverse elastic modulus <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> and the rotational stiffness per unit length of the web-flange junctions of each specimen were determined. The <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> five of the specimens were failed under simply supported end conditions and the remaining seven under semi-rigid end conditions.

5|$|In 927, a {{peace treaty}} had been signed between Bulgaria and Byzantium, ending many years of warfare and {{establishing}} forty years of peace. Both states prospered during this interlude, but {{the balance of power}} gradually shifted in favour of the Byzantines, who made great territorial gains against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East and formed a <b>web</b> <b>of</b> alliances surrounding Bulgaria. By 965/966, the warlike new Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to renew the annual tribute {{that was part of the}} peace agreement and declared war on Bulgaria. Preoccupied with his campaigns in the East, Nikephoros resolved to fight the war by proxy and invited the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav to invade Bulgaria.|$|E
