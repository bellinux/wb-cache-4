5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 season <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for the midfielder, who was sidelined for {{two months}} by knee and head {{injuries}} and first considered retirement in April 2005. Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006, the titles were revoked after the Calciopoli match fixing scandal. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Juventus' relegation from Serie A despite its first-place finish, many stars (such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram) left the club and the remaining players' future was uncertain. After the 2006 World Cup, Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A, citing {{his family and his}} commitment to the club as reasons for his decision. He received a five-match ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006, and repeated his threat to retire. However, he remained with the club {{until the end of the}} season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006–07 Serie B.|$|E
25|$|On January 26, 2010, Hill {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the St. Louis Cardinals with an invite to Spring training. General Manager John Mozeliak said that Hill was recovered from his surgery and was expected {{to compete for the}} fifth starter job. Hill struggled in spring training games, which <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for him and he was beaten out by Jaime García in the battle for the fifth starter spot.|$|E

25|$|Murat chose Occhiobello as a {{crossing}} point because {{the bridge was}} only lightly defended by a small force of Austrians {{under the command of}} Johann Freiherr von Mohr. However, the majority of the Neapolitan artillery had been diverted to the Siege of Ferrara along with a significant portion of Murat's army, where the Austrian garrison <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> the Neapolitans. Nevertheless, Murat was still able to move on Occhiobello with around 25,000 infantry and cavalry.|$|E
25|$|A power {{struggle}} ensued between King Saud and Crown Prince Faisal, and on 18December 1960, Prince Faisal resigned {{as prime minister}} in protest, arguing that King Saud <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> his financial reforms. King Saud took back his executive powers and, having induced Prince Talal to return from Egypt, appointed him as minister of finance. In 1962, however, Prince Faisal rallied enough support within the royal family to install himself as prime minister for a second time.|$|E
25|$|Plunkett's task <b>was</b> <b>frustrating.</b> He was {{a pioneer}} {{of the concept of}} {{systematic}} rural development, who, in spite of his role in Irish affairs being often overlooked, influenced many international reformers, and can be credited {{as one of the few}} who had a long-term vision for the development of rural Ireland. He was apt to remind audiences that, even if full peasant proprietorship was achieved and Home Rule was implemented, rural underdevelopment would still have to be faced. But class conflict between farmers and shopkeepers intervened to frustrate much of what he aimed to do.|$|E

25|$|For a short time, under Captain Josiah Myrick, Shoshone carried {{miners and}} their {{equipment}} from Olds Ferry to the mining areas around Boise. The mining traffic {{then took a}} different route, {{and there was no}} business for the Shoshone. She was laid up for three years, with only two watchmen keeping an eye on her. This <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for O.S.N. which had enjoyed spectacular success with almost all of its boats, often earning more on a single trip than it had cost (generally not long before) to build the steamboat in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Eala {{began his}} stint as {{commissioner}} in 2003, replacing Jun Bernardino as commissioner. Eala's first season <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> as the league {{was involved in}} several controversies. Early in the season, Talk N' Text's Asi Taulava and San Miguel's Dorian Pena {{were found to have}} tested positive of taking illegal substances by the Games and Amusements Board. This suspend both players for two games by the league. After this, Eala imposed a new drug testing policy on all PBA players. It led to massive discovery of less than 10 players testing positive, which drew several criticisms from fans and media alike.|$|E
25|$|On 21 November 2013 he {{made his}} England Ashes debut in the first match in Brisbane. He opened the innings with skipper Cook on the second day, and top-scored with 40 runs in a {{generally}} composed innings. In the second Test, in Adelaide, Carberry scored 60, his maiden Test half-century. Even though {{the remainder of the}} tour <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for Carberry, as he was unable to convert a number of good starts into significant scores, he did finish the Ashes series with the third highest English batting average, above the likes of Root, Bell and Cook.|$|E

25|$|The war <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> {{for both}} sides. Both sides tried {{to invade the}} other and were repulsed. The American high command {{remained}} incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General William Henry Harrison finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under Tecumseh in Canada, while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of Maine.|$|E

500|$|Some feminist audiences {{were also}} {{critical}} of FIG, {{saying that they}} were [...] "too virtuosic and abstract". At a Women's Festival at The Drill Hall in London, many women in the audience were unfamiliar with [...] "free music" [...] and accused FIG of being [...] "elitist" [...] and [...] "inaccessible". This <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for the members of the group who expected support from such quarters.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Chabon spent five years working on a second novel. Called Fountain City, the novel was a [...] "highly ambitious opus ... about an {{architect}} building a perfect baseball park in Florida," [...] and it eventually ballooned to 1,500 pages, {{with no end in}} sight. The process <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for Chabon, who, in his words, [...] "never felt like I was conceptually on steady ground." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked by a {{reporter}} {{what he thought of}} the nickname, Youkilis quipped, [...] "It's better than being 'the Greek God of Illegitimate Children.'" [...] But according to his dad, [...] "Kevin disliked that Greek God of Walks stuff." [...] Fans actually rooted for Youkilis to take pitches. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> to hear fans say, 'Get a walk!'" [...] Youkilis said. [...] "I'll take a walk—a walk's as good as a hit—but don't you want me to hit a home run or something?" ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Success {{or failure}} of {{democracy}} are interpreted as different equilibria of a dynamic political game. Democracy <b>is</b> <b>frustrated</b> and fails when voters do not replace corrupt leaders, given some transition cost of changing leadership, and any new leader {{would be likely to}} govern corruptly. Even when new politicians have a small probability of being virtuous, democracy can <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> in a unitary political system. But in a federal system, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> at both national and provincial levels, because provincial leaders who govern responsibly could build reputations to become contenders for higher national office. Similarly, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> in a democratization process that begins with decentralized provincial democracy and only later introduces nationally elected leadership...|$|R
50|$|Where a law {{subsequent}} to contracting is passed, which renders the fundamental principle of contracting illegal, the contract {{will be found}} to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> There <b>are</b> several situations in which this may occur. Events such as war may render certain trading or actions illegal, {{as was the case}} in Denny, Mott & Dickinson v James Fraser and also see in Ertel Bieber and Co v Rio Tinto Co Ltd 1978 AC 260. If the law changes prohibit performance after the contract was made, the contract may <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> Changes in the law may render building work illegal, or the use of certain materials illegal. A contract for the construction of a reservoir was held to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> following wartime building regulations.|$|R

500|$|The lack of {{intelligence}} on Mimoyecques <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for {{those involved in}} Operation Crossbow, the Allied effort to counter the V-weapons. On 21 March 1944 the British Chiefs of Staff discussed the shortage {{of intelligence}} but were told by Reginald Victor Jones, one of the [...] "Crossbow Committee" [...] members, that little information was leaking out because the workforce was predominantly German. The Committee's head, Duncan Sandys, pressed for greater efforts and proposed that the Special Operations Executive be tasked to kidnap a German technician who could be interrogated for information. The suggestion was approved, but was never put into effect.|$|E
500|$|Shahed Ahmed of GameSpot criticized Adventure 2s {{camera for}} the [...] "cardinal sin" [...] of 3D platformers: forcing {{a player to}} jump to an {{out-of-frame}} platform. Ahmed wrote that although a player can re-orient the camera with the trigger buttons, it reverts when the character moves. According to Chau and Liu camera issues were absent in Tails' and Eggman's levels and insignificant in Sonic's and Shadow's, but searching for Emerald shards and items in cramped sections of Knuckles' and Rouge's levels <b>was</b> <b>frustrating.</b> Edge found camera problems permeating the game, with no significant improvement from Adventure.|$|E
500|$|The Documentaly album {{concept was}} created in January, after the song [...] "Rookie" [...] was written. [...] "Endless" [...] was first {{recorded}} after [...] "Rookie", however was left uncompleted because Yamaguchi was {{not satisfied with the}} song. Yamaguchi spent eight months writing the song, recording the other compositions for the album in between working on [...] "Endless". [...] "Endless" [...] became the most central song on the album for the band, with other songs arranged around [...] "Endless" [...] to complement it. The long writing process for [...] "Endless" [...] <b>was</b> <b>frustrating</b> for Yamaguchi, making him worried about if the documentary theme expressed itself well, and considered giving up on the theme.|$|E
