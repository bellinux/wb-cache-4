25|$|Presented {{as having}} sparse and more old {{fashioned}} furnishings, the Old House {{is presented as}} being occupied in the upper story only, consisting of a main room used as the kitchen, bedroom and for washing, with the only other rooms being an adjoining second bedroom and an overhanging toilet. The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of the Old House is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the original tenant family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the farm managers house, it is now presented as a storage and <b>work</b> <b>room,</b> housing a large wooden cheese press. More children would have slept in the attic of the Old House (not accessible as a display).|$|E
500|$|The stoves {{currently}} used for heating {{did not give}} much airflow. Chimneys should be built in each <b>work</b> <b>room</b> and turf fires lit in them to give better ventilation and combat contagion by their [...] "strong, penetrating, and pungent" [...] smoke.|$|E
500|$|This tiara, {{which can}} also be worn as a necklace, was made for Queen Mary in 1919. It is not, as has {{sometimes}} been claimed, made with diamonds that once belonged to George III, but reuses diamonds taken from a necklace/tiara purchased by Queen Victoria from Collingwood & Co. as a wedding present for Princess Mary in 1893. In August 1936, Mary gave the tiara to her daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother. When the Queen Mother, consort of George VI, first wore the tiara, Sir Henry Channon called it [...] "an ugly spiked tiara". Later, she lent the piece to her daughter, Elizabeth, as [...] "something borrowed" [...] for her wedding to Prince Philip in 1947. As Elizabeth was getting dressed at Buckingham Palace before leaving for Westminster Abbey, the tiara snapped. Luckily, the court jeweller was standing by in case of any emergency, and was rushed to his <b>work</b> <b>room</b> by a police escort. The Queen Mother reassured her daughter {{that it would be}} fixed in time, and it was. She also lent it to her granddaughter, Princess Anne, for her marriage to Captain Mark Phillips in 1973. It was put on show at an exhibition with a number of other royal tiaras in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|When Escrivá was 10 or 11 years old, {{he already}} had the habit of {{carrying}} the rosary in his pocket. As a priest, he would ordinarily end his homilies and his personal prayer with {{a conversation with the}} Blessed Virgin. He instructed that all rooms in the offices of Opus Dei should have an image of the Virgin. He encouraged his spiritual children to greet these images when they entered a room. He encouraged a Marian apostolate, preaching that [...] "To Jesus we go and to Him we return through Mary". While looking at a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe giving a rose to San Juan Diego, he commented: [...] "I would like to die that way." [...] On 26 June 1975, after entering his <b>work</b> <b>room,</b> which had a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, he slumped on the floor and died.|$|E
2500|$|After Bell and Watson {{discovered}} on June 2, 1875, that {{movements of the}} reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate {{in front of the}} pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter. This was the [...] "gallows" [...] phone. A few days later they were tried together, one {{at each end of the}} line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath. Bell, in the <b>work</b> <b>room,</b> held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell spoke into his instrument, [...] "Do you understand what I say?" [...] and Mr. Watson answered [...] "Yes". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane.|$|E

A shade of vexation passed across her face as she recognized Jeremy Braxton's voice. She paused in indecision, neither seeing nor being seen.|$|E
6000|$|Dick Forrest, {{turning off}} lights as he went, {{penetrated}} the library, and, while selecting {{half a dozen}} reference volumes on mechanics and physics, smiled as if pleased with himself at recollection of the interview with his sister-in-law. He was confident that he had spoken in time and not a moment too soon. But, half way up the book-concealed spiral staircase {{that led to his}} <b>work</b> <b>room,</b> a remark of Ernestine, echoing in his consciousness, made him stop from very suddenness to lean his shoulder against the wall.--"Paula would be more his kind." ...|$|E

When you arrive at the head of it, you are right in his room, surrounded by shelves of books. I have just come from there. I was going in to see him when I heard voices. Of course it was ranch business, I thought, and they would soon be gone. So I waited. It was ranch business, but it was so interesting, so, what Hancock would call, illuminating, that I remained and eavesdropped. It was illuminating of Dick, I mean.|$|E

At last she came to his books--a goodly row of pamphlets, bound magazine articles, and an even dozen ambitious tomes. She read the titles painstakingly: [...] "Corn in California," [...] "Silage Practice," [...] "Farm Organization," [...] "Farm Book-keeping," [...] "The Shire in America," [...] "Humus Destruction," [...] "Soilage," [...] "Alfalfa in California," [...] "Cover Crops for California," [...] "The Shorthorn in America"--at this last she smiled affectionately with memory of the great controversy he had waged for the beef cow and the milch cow as against the dual purpose cow.|$|E
