He was recruited by Spratt, who would later go on to say that Cruft had lent forward in the interview at one point whilst talking about the business and said [...] "You know, I think this kind of business ought to do very <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> honestly." [...] Cruft overhauled the bookkeeping in the shop, changing it from a system using crosses to distinguish between wholesale and retail customers to a far more detailed system. The Maltese cross that was previously used in the bookkeeping was later instead stamped onto the biscuits as a type of trademark to distinguish Spratt's biscuits from other dog biscuits.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, Mr Pinch!' she said, 'although I {{never used}} you <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> believe your nature was forgiving. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{think you could}} be cruel.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went there}} after I left London. You know I dropped {{medicine}} {{and took up}} physics? No; <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Light fascinated me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Those boys,' said Lance. 'What, Sum and Frank? <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{think it}} queer that the sailors {{on board the}} Kittiwake called every one My Lord.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, I {{remember}} you very <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see people {{often enough to}} forget them. And papa {{said that you were}} coming home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I am at {{this moment}} authoritatively {{informed}} that [...] "The Tribune" [...] did not mean me, after all. Very <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not care two cents.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No? yes? it is! <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> declare, {{how nice}} that is!' And hastily {{pursuing}} the unhappy woman, {{who was making}} for the door, Mrs Parmalee cried eagerly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Airley Gibbs, hain't it? Runs a livery {{business}} daown to Rutgers, on Lovejoy's railroad," [...] replied Mr. Bixby, promptly. [...] "I know him. Knew old man Gibbs <b>well's</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> you. Mean cuss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are shaken, my Jeanne," [...] he said tenderly, [...] "but {{you have}} borne the trial <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear you cry out, though madame, {{and the little}} one screamed loudly enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, yes; {{you wrote}} me a very kind letter, which I ought to have answered. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> forget, Lady Constantine. My new {{telescope}} won't work, and I don't {{know what to do}} about it at all!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{it not be}} too provoking, Amy, if {{this key}} should not fit after all? <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe you would be any more {{disappointed}} than I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am doing}} my work for you," [...] Norgate remarked, [...] "and doing it {{extraordinarily}} <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not object to}} {{a certain amount of}} surveillance, but I am getting fed up with Boko." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{these are}} marks between the pounds, shillings, and pence,' said Claude, 'I took them for elevens; <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wonder at your troubles, I {{could not do}} this sum as it is set.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The first I {{have often}} told you. Considering myself {{sufficiently}} incongruous on my legal eminence, I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny. You know M. R.

5000|$|Chancellors {{come and}} go. If even {{high-level}} officials can be caned, then perhaps {{one day we}} will be caned as <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not speak those words just for Pei Zhouxian, but for all learned people of the realm.|$|R

6000|$|JONES. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> an' my word's {{as good as}} yours. I 've {{never been}} had up in a police court before. Look 'ere, don't you {{remember}} you had a sky-blue bag in your 'and [BARTHWICK jumps.] ...|$|E
60|$|BLY. [Modestly] <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{a bit in}} that line, too. In {{my opinion}} Nature made the {{individual}} believe he's goin' to live after'e's dead just to keep 'im livin' while 'es alive--otherwise he'd 'a died out.|$|E
6000|$|He dug his toe into a drift, like a schoolboy. [...] "Rats. You mean I {{talk too}} much. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> when I {{get hold of}} {{somebody}} like you. You probably want to run along and keep your nose from freezing." ...|$|E

60|$|BILL [his {{resolution}} oozing] <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> ain't <b>done</b> nothin to er.|$|R
6000|$|... "God in Heaven! Yes, because I {{thought he}} had come to rob us. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not shoot, and {{afterwards}} we were hunted out of the place, which does not much matter, as those fools of natives refused to let us dig in the fortress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Benicia, [...] "you {{of course}} mean my father. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think he}} will fail you, and though he has not {{actually}} told me so, I fancy he has, at least, been making preparations for the sweeping." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't get off {{second-hand}} jokes, Basil," [...] she said; and [...] "Why, here!" [...] she cried, whirling {{round to}} the door before which they had halted, [...] "this is the very number. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe it's a sign!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{at least}} will be richer," [...] {{said the other}} woman, [...] "and by the crown of Baaltis. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not grudge it you, {{and as for the}} {{daughter}} of Sakon, she shall be Ithobal's if I take her to him limb by limb." ...|$|E
60|$|SAVOYARD. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> know; but {{its one of}} the {{recognized}} ways of chaffing him. However, youll get on with him all right: hes {{a man of the}} world and a man of sense. The one youll {{have to be careful about}} is Vaughan.|$|R
6000|$|ANABEL. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a small kitten--asleep--with its paws crossed.

60|$|MRS GEORGE. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> {{know what}} a woman is like when her hair's pulled. I {{know what a}} man is like when he's bit. I know what theyre both like when you {{tell them what you}} really feel about them. And thats how I know more of the world than you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is <b>well</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know it. I {{thought it}} {{unsatisfactory}} {{to hear of}} no profit, after all the talk there has been about his books. I feared it was an empty trade: {{but this is something}} like. Five thousand! He is a clever fellow after all!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do I know? <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know. Instinct, I suppose. The {{instinct}} of self-preservation which nature gives hunted animals. I can't {{think of}} a single man in the world--except your Marvin, of course--who wouldn't do anything for money." [...] She stopped. [...] "Well, yes, one." ...|$|E
60|$|A. You don't? <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Anyway, I don't see {{how they}} could ever have been such a blundering lot as to go and bury the wrong child. But, 'sh!--don't mention it where the family can hear of it. Heaven knows they have heartbreaking {{troubles}} enough without adding this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>well,</b> <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean}} to speak about that. Things are {{unpacked}} easier than they are packed. But, however-- Never mind.

6000|$|... "And do you remember, Jean," [...] {{continued}} Bourdin, [...] "when M.
