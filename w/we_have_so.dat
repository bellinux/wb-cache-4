25|$|In three {{dimensions}} this restates in matrix form an observation made by Euler, so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles Euler angles. However, {{the situation is}} somewhat more complicated than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far indicated. Despite the small dimension, we actually have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use; {{and we also have}} some freedom in the choice of angles. Thus we find many different conventions employed when three-dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics, or medicine, or chemistry, or other disciplines. When we include the option of world axes or body axes, 24 different sequences are possible. And while some disciplines call any sequence Euler angles, others give different names (Cardano, Tait–Bryan, roll-pitch-yaw) to different sequences.|$|E

[...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E

500|$|While Glee also {{features}} Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers {{declined to give}} the two scenes together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond [...] "Home", Falchuk commented that the producers want to [...] "have her around as much as possible", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: [...] " [...] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back. The one advantage we have, I think, is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many incredibly talented people in our … cast that … we don't need [...] as much.

500|$|Patton {{developed}} {{an ability to}} deliver charismatic speeches, {{in part because he}} had trouble with reading. He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command but offended other generals, including Bradley. The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord. When speaking, he was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, [...] "The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored halftrack and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many God-awful drivers." [...] During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should [...] "let the sons-of-bitches [...] {{go all the way to}} Paris, then we'll cut them off and round them up." [...] He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could [...] "drive the British back into the sea for another Dunkirk." ...|$|E

We will not look out of place in the First Division because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and I was delighted to be part of them.

500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "True Love Waits" [...] for their third album, OK Computer (1997), but discarded it. They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E
500|$|Like Falloppio and Bartholin, De Graaf criticized Colombo's {{claim of}} having {{discovered}} the clitoris; his work {{appears to have}} provided the first comprehensive account of clitoral anatomy. [...] "We are extremely surprised that some anatomists make no more mention of this part than {{if it did not}} exist at all in the universe of nature," [...] he stated. [...] "In every cadaver <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> far dissected we have found it quite perceptible to sight and touch." [...] De Graaf stressed the need to distinguish nympha from clitoris, choosing to [...] "always give [...] the name clitoris" [...] to avoid confusion; this resulted in frequent use of the correct name for the organ among anatomists, but considering that nympha was also varied in its use and eventually became the term specific to the labia minora, more confusion ensued. Debate about whether orgasm was even necessary for women began in the Victorian era, and Freud's 1905 theory about the immaturity of clitoral orgasms (see above) negatively affected women's sexuality throughout most of the 20th century. From the 18th– 20th century, especially during the 20th, details of the clitoris from various genital diagrams presented in earlier centuries were omitted from later texts.|$|E
