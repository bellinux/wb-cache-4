500|$|Gandhi {{spent the}} day of {{independence}} not celebrating {{the end of the}} British rule, but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Some writers credit Gandhi's fasting and protests stopped the religious riots and communal violence. Others do not. Archibald Wavell, for example, upon learning of Gandhi's assassination, commented, [...] "I always thought he [...] had more of malevolence than benevolence in him, but <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> judge, and how can an Englishman estimate a Hindu?" ...|$|E

2500|$|P. Diddy {{was one of}} the {{executive}} producers for the album, although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. [...] "On the third LP, it was suggested (by Def Jam) to bring in Harve Pierre and P. Diddy. <b>Who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn't the direction to go in, and I know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Abbot {{has made}} peace with the King. He would give up the island, and St. Etheldreda should keep all her lands and honors. I said what <b>I</b> could; but <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> resist the whole chapter? Could I alone brave St. Etheldreda's wrath?" ...|$|R
60|$|All <b>I</b> knew <b>was</b> that {{he disliked}} me {{and had some}} {{contempt}} for my person. Why? Apparently because his ship had been delayed three hours on my account. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> have such a thing done for me? Such a thing had never been done for him. It {{was a sort of}} jealous indignation.|$|R
60|$|We {{talked and}} lingered at the bar. It {{seemed to me}} strange that we lingered. We had had our beer. But <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> lead the way outside when great Nelson chose to lean against the bar? After a few minutes, to my surprise, {{he asked me to}} have another drink, which I did. And still we talked, and Nelson evinced no {{intention}} of leaving the bar.|$|R
2500|$|In late 2007, {{a second}} album was also {{released}} Sony BMG as Marcelo's first full-length album for entitled I Shine For You. [...] She {{said that the}} title track best describes her struggles during Philippine Idol {{as well as her}} way of thanking her fans for their unwavering support. [...] The album also includes a song penned by popular composer Vehnee Saturno entitled [...] "Sino Ba Naman Ako" [...] (<b>Who</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>To...),</b> which was used as one of the theme songs in the Filipino-dubbed broadcast of Come Back Soon-ae on GMA Network (the other one being [...] "Minsan Lang Kitang Iibigin"). [...] The album was launched on GMA's variety show SOP.|$|E
2500|$|He {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} a [...] "gay lobby" [...] within the Vatican in remarks during a meeting held in private with Catholic religious from Latin America. He was reported to have promised to see what could be done to address the issue. [...] In July 2013, he responded directly to journalists' questions. He notably drew a distinction between the problem of lobbying and the sexual orientation of people: [...] "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> judge?" [...] "The problem", he said, [...] "is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, Wurzelbacher {{took a job}} at a Jeep plant which {{required}} him {{to be a member of}} the United Auto Workers. He complained that his colleagues have called him a [...] "Tea-bagger". The Washington Post, citing Sean McAlinden, who has studied the auto-bailout as the Chief Economist for the non-profit Center for Automotive Research, commented that an [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "that Joe the Plumber may not have gotten this auto job if it weren’t for the hated bailout of the auto industry" [...] which was [...] "first championed by Bush" [...] but attacked by conservatives when implemented by Obama. McAliden is quoted saying “He wouldn’t have gotten a job in Toledo if Chrysler hadn’t been bailed out..Chrysler would have shut down immediately. No production; no jobs; no pension payments; no nothing." [...] For his part, Joe indicated he has no problem with unions per se, stating [...] "Private unions, such as the UAW, is a choice between employees and employers. If that is what they want, then <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> say you can’t have it?".|$|E

2500|$|Ghostface {{appeared}} on the 2002 Bad Boy Records release, We Invented the Remix, along with Combs on the remix to the song [...] "Special Delivery." [...] Ghostface even gives Bad Boy Records a shout out for inviting him on the track when he raps [...] "Bad Boy, {{thank you for this}} special delivery." [...] Combs was one of the executive producers for Method Man's 2004 album , although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. [...] "On the third LP, it was suggested to bring in Harve Pierre and P Diddy. <b>Who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn't the direction to go in, and I know that now." [...] In 2006, Method Man also called out Combs' decisions on the posthumous Notorious B.I.G. album , saying that Biggie never would have rocked with some of the sub-par rappers featured on it. [...] He also brought up {{the fact that he was}} the only other rapper that Biggie chose to feature on his debut album Ready to Die.|$|E
2500|$|Santorum {{has written}} for Catholic {{publications}} and frequently comments on political issues from a religious standpoint. He has said, [...] "I don't believe in an America where {{the separation of church}} and state is absolute. The First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means bringing people and their faith into the public square." [...] In an interview with the National Catholic Reporter, Santorum said that the distinction between private religious conviction and public responsibility, espoused by President John F. Kennedy, had caused [...] "great harm in America". He said: [...] "All of us have heard people say, 'I privately am against abortion, homosexual marriage, stem cell research, cloning. But <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> decide that it's not right for somebody else?' It sounds good, but it is the corruption of freedom of conscience." [...] Santorum has been criticized for not separating his politics from his personal faith, and has been accused of advancing a [...] "Christian theocracy" [...] through his work. He told a group of college students in 2008 that the United States had been founded on [...] "Judeo-Christian" [...] ethics, and now [...] "it is a shambles, it is gone from the world of Christianity as I see it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pickler's {{mother was}} {{repeatedly}} charged with writing bad checks and {{was convicted in}} 1988 for passing a forged prescription for Valium at the Albemarle Wal-Mart, where she worked. Pickler's parents split up the day after her second birthday; a year later, in July 1989, her mother vanished. During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, [...] northeast of Charlotte. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with The Observer, Pickler said: [...] "She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me." [...] In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said {{that her mother had}} moved to Union County with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again, and Pickler has not heard from her since. Her father, whom she describes as an alcoholic and drug addict, served a three-year-nine-month prison sentence at Florida State Prison for aggravated assault and battery stemming from a 2003 stabbing incident. [...] He was released on May 6, 2006, a week after her elimination from Idol. In an April 2006 interview with NBC Pickler said, [...] "One thing that's so important in life is we learn to forgive others. I ask the Lord every day to forgive me for my sins and for things that I've done wrong. And <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> not forgive someone for what they've done?" ..."God tells us to love everyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} McAvennie's {{success on the}} pitch came to the {{attention}} of TV producers. He appeared on the BBC's Wogan show, hosted by Terry Wogan, an event which McAvennie claims changed his life and introduced him to a celebrity lifestyle. He is quoted as saying [...] "Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never under any illusions why it was happening. It wisnae because of my looks, it <b>was</b> because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a footballer." ...|$|R
60|$|It was not Pilate's indecision that decided me. It {{was this}} Jesus that decided Pilate and me. This Jesus looked at me. He {{commanded}} me. I {{tell you this}} vagrant fisherman, this wandering preacher, this piece of driftage from Galilee, commanded me. No word he uttered. Yet his command was there, unmistakable as a trumpet call. And I stayed my foot, and held my hand, for <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> thwart the will and way of so greatly serene and sweetly sure a man as this? And as I stayed I knew all the charm of him--all that in him had charmed Miriam and Pilate's wife, that had charmed Pilate himself.|$|R

5000|$|The Canadian punk-rock band Sum 41 {{released}} a song titled [...] "Look At Me" [...] from their LP Underclass Hero.

[...] The album title itself is a reference to another Lennon song, [...] "Working Class Hero".|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Eyebrows, [...] "the {{sooner you}} provide {{yourself}} with a hide for the purpose, the better, for I will never return the lasso to you; for <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> fight against Providence, that took {{it out of my}} hands?" ...|$|E
60|$|But do I blame St. Peter for saying, 'Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord'? God forbid! <b>Who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I,</b> <b>to</b> blame St. Peter? Especially {{when even}} the Lord Jesus did not blame him, but only bade {{him not to}} be afraid.|$|E

5000|$|It's {{interesting}} about the theme song. Not only is it costly - and that never sort of drives what we do creatively, but I think fans don't understand that there's {{money on the table}} every time they hear the theme song. That sounds like a bullshit producer response, too, but that's a part of it because every year our budget is pretty challenged. Knowing that, when I looked at the jump ahead, the four year jump, I felt like [...] "I Don't Wanna Be" [...] was very much an anthem for their adolescent lives. It was very much about <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> and <b>who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> someday. Not to mention that it was 42 seconds of screen time that I knew I could use for story. So a lot went into the decision to drop the theme song, it wasn't done lightly.|$|R

5000|$|Creator Danny Arnold was {{originally}} {{against the idea}} of giving the character of Fish his own spin-off, believing that Fish was a character that was better suited to the precinct. Originally, Arnold agreed to the spin-off on the condition that Vigoda continued to play his Fish character on the show in half of the episodes of the third season, as well as future seasons. However, Vigoda persisted on quitting Barney Miller and staying on just Fish, wanting to be the star of his own series. [...] "I found myself with a very unhappy actor on my hands. Abe would walk around the set like a man in shock. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> deprive an actor of this once-in-a-lifetime break? Finally I said, 'Okay, just stay through the third year of Barney Miller, and we'll go with your show, too," [...] recalled Arnold.|$|R

Her beauty dazzled me, her charm enmeshed me, and she had grown by now in worldly wisdom and mental attainments. Yet I set a mask upon my passion, and walked very circumspectly, for all that by nature <b>I</b> <b>was</b> as reckless and profligate as all the world could ever call me.
