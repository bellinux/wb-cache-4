60|$|The prudent husbandman, {{after having}} {{taken from his}} field all the straw that is there, rakes it over with a <b>wooden</b> <b>rake</b> and gets as much again. The wise child, after the {{lemonade}} jug is empty, takes the lemons {{from the bottom of}} it and squeezes them into a still larger brew. So does the sagacious author, after having sold his material to the magazines and been paid for it, clap it into book-covers and give it another squeeze. But in the present case the author is of a nice conscience and anxious to place responsibility where it is due. He therefore wishes to make all proper acknowledgments to the editors of Vanity Fair, The American Magazine, The Popular Magazine, Life, Puck, The Century, Methuen's Annual, and all others who are in any way implicated in the making of this book.|$|E
60|$|Other {{players had}} also placed their stakes, some with cool calculating precision, a few with nervous uncertainty, many with {{apparent}} indifference. With {{the exception of}} the Count and a lady near him, however, there was little of what might indicate very strong feeling on any countenance. One young and pretty girl, after placing her little pile of silver, stood awaiting the result with calm indifference-- possibly assumed. Whatever might be the thoughts or feelings of the players, there was nothing but business-like gravity stamped on the countenances of the four men who presided over the revolving board, each with neatly-arranged rows of silver five-franc pieces in front of him, and a <b>wooden</b> <b>rake</b> lying ready to hand. Each player also had a rake, with which he or she pushed the coins staked upon a certain space of the table, or on one of the dividing lines, which gave at least a varied, if not a better, chance.|$|E

5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple <b>wooden</b> <b>raking</b> cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} corbel brick pendant. A semicircular fanlight, or lunette, {{is located in the}} center of the gable of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.|$|R

50|$|Other old names now {{rarely used}} include American Dogwood, Florida Dogwood, Indian Arrowwood, Cornelian Tree, White Cornel, White Dogwood, False Box, and False Boxwood. This species {{has in the}} past been used in the {{production}} of inks, scarlet dyes, and as a quinine substitute. The hard, dense wood has been used for products such as golf club heads, mallets, <b>wooden</b> <b>rake</b> teeth, tool handles, jeweler’s boxes and butcher’s blocks. Cornus florida is the state tree and flower of Virginia. It is also the state tree of Missouri and state flower of North Carolina. It was used to treat dogs with mange, which may be how it got its name. The red berries are edible, but do not taste good.|$|E
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the salt pan (French oeillet) may be {{composed}} of clay lined pools, basalt, sand, concrete, or even tile. This keeps the salt from coming {{into contact with the}} silt beneath and becoming dirty. Every few days or even daily, the harvester (French paludier) pushes or pulls the salt with a long <b>wooden</b> <b>rake.</b> This must be done carefully as the depth of the brine may be as little as ¼ inch and the clay bottom must not be penetrated at the risk of contaminating the salt. The salt is raked toward the sides of the pan where it is then shoveled into a pile and left to dry slightly before storing. 90 to 165 pounds of sel gris can be harvested in one day, whereas for fleurs de sel the daily yield is only 4.5 to 6.6 pounds.|$|E
5000|$|The Romans {{introduced}} small (3 ft square) pans {{made from}} lead using wood as a fuel. In Britain they established towns for salt production at Droitwich in Worcestershire, and Nantwich, Middlewich [...] and Northwich [...] in Cheshire. In the early Middle Ages these developed into the 'wich' towns of Cheshire. Small 'wich' houses containing several lead pans to evapourate the brine into salt, clustered around brine springs {{within each of}} the towns. The open-pan process continued largely unchanged throughout the medieval period. A 17th-century German wood-cut by Georgius Agricola shows the process in detail. Excavated evidence has uncovered <b>wooden</b> <b>rakes</b> to draw salt crystals {{to the side of the}} pan, and conical wicker baskets (barrows) in which the wet salt was drained and dried.|$|R
50|$|A {{hay rake}} may be mechanized, drawn by a tractor or draft animals, {{or it may}} be a hand tool. The {{earliest}} hay rakes were nothing more than tree branches, but <b>wooden</b> hand <b>rakes</b> with <b>wooden</b> teeth, similar in design to a garden rake but larger, were prevalent in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and still are used in some locations around the world.|$|R
5000|$|Schnitzelbank {{literally}} means [...] "scrap bench" [...] or [...] "chip bench" [...] (from Schnitzel [...] "scraps / clips / cuttings (from carving)" [...] or the colloquial verb schnitzeln [...] "to make scraps" [...] or [...] "to carve" [...] and Bank [...] "bench"); {{like the}} Bank, it is feminine {{and takes the}} article [...] "die". It is a woodworking tool used in Germany prior to the industrial revolution. It was in regular use in colonial New England, and in the Appalachian region until early in the 20th century; it is still in use by specialist artisans today. In America it {{is known as a}} shaving horse. It uses the mechanical advantage of a foot-operated lever to securely clamp the object to be carved. The shaving horse is used in combination with the drawknife or spokeshave to cut down green or seasoned wood, to accomplish jobs such as handling an ax; creating <b>wooden</b> <b>rakes,</b> hay forks, walking sticks, etc. The shaving horse was used by various trades, from farmer to basketmaker and wheelwright.|$|R
5000|$|One {{method of}} {{gathering}} sea salt is to draw seawater into marsh basins or salt pans {{and allow the}} water to evaporate, leaving behind the salt that was dissolved in it. As the water evaporates, most of the salt precipitates out {{on the bottom of}} the marsh or pan (and is later collected as ordinary sea salt), but some salt crystals float on the surface of the water, forming a delicate crust of intricate pyramidal crystals. This is fleur de sel. The delicacy requires that it be harvested by hand, so this is done with traditional methods using traditional tools. In France, the workers who collect fleur de sel are called paludiers, and they employ a <b>wooden</b> <b>rake</b> called a lousse à fleur to gently rake it from the water. In Portugal, a butterfly-shaped sieve called a borboleta is used instead. It is then put in special boxes so that it will dry in the sun, and to avoid disturbing the flakes as it is transported for packaging. Historically, the workers who harvested fleur de sel were women, because it was believed that as the salt crystals were so delicate, they needed to be collected by [...] "the more delicate sex." [...] Because it is scraped from the salt marsh like cream from milk, fleur de sel has been called [...] "the cream of the salt pans." [...] It is also called [...] "the caviar of sea salts." ...|$|E
50|$|With several streams {{for water}} power, Dixfield {{developed}} into a small mill town. It had sawmills and gristmills. It also produced cheese, carriages, shingles, toothpicks, <b>rakes,</b> <b>wooden</b> boxes, flies and leaders, boots and shoes. Dixfield once had a marble works.|$|R
50|$|Its {{distinctive}} {{feature is the}} arrangement of the lower stretcher between the legs as a double-ended Y-shape. The shape of each end, and their joinery, was based on traditional English craft woodworking and the construction of <b>wooden</b> hay <b>rakes.</b> The stretcher is not merely a simple Y shape, but its junction is braced by a T-shaped joint, as was needed for the work of a rake. Some modern reproductions simplify this to a plain Y, abandoning the design's original roots.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} {{study of this}} work {{is based on the}} {{proposal}} of a new material to replace the rakes of the bagasse conveyors of the Sugar Industry; as a solution to the current practice of replacing conventional <b>wooden</b> <b>rakes</b> by the variant of laminated tubes and channel beam. The use of these last ones increases the weight in the conveyors and causes a greater consumption of energy; in addition, an overload could bring with it bigger breakages and the increase of the costs in the interruptions. The value of the resistance to the static flexion of conventional materials (like Pinus Caribaea and Lysiloma Bahamensis), with values of maximum resistance to the static flexion (FH) : FH= 113, 19 MPa y FH = 46, 33 MPa respectively, was obtained experimentally. For the substitution of the rakes, a polymeric matrix composite material of Bamboo fiber with knot, with bark and without treatment (BCCCNST) and a matrix of polyester resin is proposed. The breaking limit for BCCCNST is 116 MPa and for the polyester resin it can range from 80 to 150 MPa, so that both have properties within the ranges required for this application. When comparing the power required for different scenarios, it was detected that in all cases the installed power is above the necessary, so it would be advisable to replace the motor with one of smaller capacity...|$|R
50|$|The Stadium was roofed in 1911.

5000|$|In 1974 {{an ambitious}} {{production}} of Henry IV, Part 1 and 2, {{was described by}} Michael Billington; [...] "Bill Dudley has ingeniously transformed the auditorium into a medieval loft with a <b>raked</b> <b>wooden</b> platform bisecting the audience and a mini-drawbridge being lowered from a balcony for processional entrances. This means that the actors are rarely more than about fifteen {{feet away from the}} audience; and crucial speeches, like Falstaff's on Honour, can be addressed to individual spectators rather than hurled at a faceless throng".|$|R
50|$|Interior renovations {{included}} {{restoring the}} theater to a professional-grade working venue {{suitable for a}} diverse range of programming and rentals. Work included the rehabilitation of the stage, performance hall and mezzanine, which now features a new lighting and sound booth. Support spaces, including dressing rooms, a Reception Room and accessible restrooms, were also restored. Part of the project included preservation of the facility’s historic character, including the proscenium arch and <b>raked</b> <b>wooden</b> floor stage, which were late 19th century additions. The historic fabric was also retained, with new elements sensitively incorporated to retain the overall historic character of the spaces.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{of the church is}} plastered. There is a panelled west gallery carried on four thin fluted <b>wooden</b> columns containing <b>raked</b> seating. There is a three-decker pulpit with a tester, and panelled box pews. The transept was used as a family pew and contains box pews and a fireplace. On the north wall of the chancel are memorials dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. Also on the chancel walls and arch are painted boards containing the Ten Commandments and biblical texts. Elsewhere in the church are three medieval stone coffins and a carved coffin lid.|$|R
50|$|Among the Hidatsa, {{typical of}} Great Plains farmers, fields were cleared by burning which also fertilized the soil. The three {{implements}} used by Indian farmers were the digging stick, hoe, and rake. The digging stick was a sharpened and fire-hardened stick, {{three or more}} feet long, {{that was used to}} loosen soil, uproot weeds, and make planting holes. The hoe was made from a buffalo or elk shoulder blade bone, or scapula, lashed to a <b>wooden</b> handle. The <b>rake</b> was made from wood or an antler. Some Indian women preferred the bone hoe even after the iron hoe was introduced by European traders and settlers.|$|R
50|$|The RSC {{had first}} tackled its {{need for a}} small {{auditorium}} in 1971. At the insistence of Sir Trevor Nunn (who had taken over as artistic director in 1968), the company hired The Place off the Euston Road in London and constructed its own theatre space for an audience of 330, seated on <b>raked</b> <b>wooden</b> benches. Two seasons of plays were staged in 1972 and 1973, none suitable for the Aldwych. In December 1973 Buzz Goodbody, the company's first female director, drew up a plan for what would become The Other Place studio theatre in Stratford, designed by Michael Reardon to seat 140 people, which opened to a first and highly successful season in 1974. The name chosen for the new studio space was favoured within the company because it implied an alternative theatre, {{but also because it}} is a quotation from Hamlet.|$|R
40|$|Daily weather, {{seasonal}} {{weather conditions}} and anomalies, long-term climate change, and natural disasters {{have had an}} outstanding influence on pre-modern Alpine economies. This paper will follow up the topics presented at the first conference in Hall (2015), which focused on the threat of avalanches and floods towards Alpine trade routes on the one hand, and on {{the economic impact of}} locust invasions on the other hand. In this paper, emphasis is given on damage caused by floods and adaptation strategies in coping with them. The examples are mostly taken from the Eastern Alps, but will be compared with evidence from the Western Alps. One impact of recurrent floods is the swamp formation in flat valley, which were used for grazing cattle. Areas like the Upper Salzach Valley south of Lake Zellersee had been flooded up to ten times a year, which made the swampy meadows not usable for agricultural use any longer. This fact is also true for areas in Switzerland such as the Linth plain southeast of Lake Zurichsee, the lower reaches of the Guerbe River south of Bern or the Grosses Moos marshland situated between Lakes Neuchâtel, Biel and Murten in the Western Swiss Plateau. Floods had also a crucial influence on the transport of timber, in particular from Alpine forests to the mining districts and to the salterns in Tyrol, in the County of Salzburg and in the Salzkammergut. If one of the <b>wooden</b> <b>rakes</b> (barriers to collect the trunks at the destination) broke due to the power of water, the trunks flushed down the river and became destructive like torpedoes. Bridges and mills were destroyed. Due to the immense loss of firewood the smelting furnaces and the salt production had to be closed for weeks or even months. If the water on the rivers was too high or too low, the transport capacities on the rivers were significantly diminished, such as salt shipping along the Salzach and lower Inn Rivers. Furthermore, most of the mills could not work during that time, causing a deep impact on local food production (flour etc.) and on the processing of goods. However, premodern societies in the Alpine areas and the nearby foothills, tried to cope and adapt with the available means. In case of a flood, warning systems existed, e. g. by local skippers. Parts of mills and bridges could be removed or reinforced quickly. The houses of craftsmen in frequently flooded areas of cities such as Steyr or Bern were solidly built of ashlar blocks in the ground floor, with the possibility to evacuate any precious goods or machines to the upper floors. Carpenters in the cities became specialized in the permanent repairs of wooden bridges and made 10 - 20 percent of their annual turnover by works related floods. Early rectification and drainage projects should make swampy floodplains re-usable for agriculture...|$|R
5000|$|With the Stadiums deal in place, Gordon {{refitted}} {{the stage}} at the old Sydney Stadium, installing Australia's first rotating stage, which was placed {{on top of the}} old fight ring in the centre of the arena. Located in Ruschcutters Bay, the Stadium was only a short distance from the Big Show office, but it was far from luxurious. Locally - and quite accurately - known as [...] "The Old Tin Shed", it was a very rudimentary structure by modern standards. It was octagonal in shape, with <b>raked</b> <b>wooden</b> seats facing towards the central stage, and it had a maximum capacity of around 11,000. It was built with an iron and wood frame rising from a brick base, but the roof and walls were covered in corrugated steel, which was both unlined and uninsulated. This created a formidable echo which often made music and lyrics difficult to hear clearly, and although it proved to be well-suited to providing a facsimile of the 'slapback' echo found on many rock'n'roll records, once the audience started screaming, the reverberation made it impossible to hear anything, even on stage. At The Beatles' concert there in 1964, one Sydney newspaper sent along a sound engineer, who reportedly monitored the sound level from the hordes of screaming teenyboppers at well over 100 decibels. Adding to its drawbacks, the building had no air-conditioning or forced ventilation and its metal skin made it both unbearably hot in the sweltering Sydney summer (when many concert tours were scheduled) and deafeningly loud in heavy rain.|$|R
