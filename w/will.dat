5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök <b>will</b> be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters <b>will</b> arrive without a summer, and the sun <b>will</b> be useless. High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters <b>will</b> have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed <b>will</b> cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons <b>will</b> suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf <b>will</b> swallow the sun, then his brother <b>will</b> swallow the moon, and mankind <b>will</b> consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars <b>will</b> disappear.

5|$|For Kant a good <b>will</b> is {{a broader}} {{conception}} than a <b>will</b> which acts from duty. A <b>will</b> which acts from duty is distinguishable as a <b>will</b> which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful <b>will</b> is thus a special case of a good <b>will</b> which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, the {{hydrogen}} {{burning in the}} shell around the solar core <b>will</b> increase {{the mass of the}} core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature <b>will</b> become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon <b>will</b> begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun <b>will</b> shrink from around 250 to 11times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity <b>will</b> decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature <b>will</b> increase to about 4770K. The Sun <b>will</b> become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage <b>will</b> last only 100million years. Eventually, it <b>will</b> have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and <b>will</b> expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun <b>will</b> increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it <b>will</b> cool to about 3500K. This phase lasts about 30million years, after which, {{over the course of a}} further 100,000years, the Sun's remaining outer layers <b>will</b> fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material <b>will</b> contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.|$|E
