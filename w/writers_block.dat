40|$|Literary {{creativity}} and its shadow, the phenomenon popularly {{referred to as}} <b>writer's</b> <b>block,</b> have historically been accorded little attention by literary studies. In my thesis I seek to redress this oversight, illustrating my argument {{with reference to the}} creative life and works of Malcolm Lowry. I begin by arguing for a model of literary creativity that takes seriously the roles played by plans and intentions in motivating, sustaining and appropriately terminating literary creative action. I employ this model in order to provide a basis from which to clarify Lowry's own creative method. I go on to rehearse and evaluate definitions and theories of <b>writer's</b> <b>block</b> from a variety of research paradigms. From these accounts I distill some important general features of <b>writer's</b> <b>block.</b> I argue that <b>writer's</b> <b>block</b> typically occurs as an intervention between stages of the literary creative process. Finally, I return to detailed consideration of Lowry's creative method. I investigate three critical periods of <b>writer's</b> <b>block</b> in Lowry's later life and examine these interventions with reference to circumstantial, methodological and goal-based considerations. I conclude by drawing attention to the importance for literary studies of an accurate and comprehensive understanding of both literary {{creativity and}} <b>writer's</b> <b>block...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Writer's</b> <b>block</b> is a condition, {{primarily}} {{associated with}} writing, {{in which an}} author loses the ability to produce new work, or experiences a creative slowdown.

40|$|PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED: <b>Writer's</b> <b>block,</b> or a {{distinctly}} uncomfortable inability to write, {{can interfere with}} professional productivity. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: To identify <b>writer's</b> <b>block</b> and to outline suggestions for its early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. MAIN COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM: Once the diagnosis has been established, a stepwise approach to care is recommended. Mild blockage can be resolved by evaluating and revising expectations, conducting a task analysis, and giving oneself positive feedback. Moderate blockage can be addressed by creative exercises, such as brainstorming and role-playing. Recalcitrant blockage can be resolved with therapy. <b>Writer's</b> <b>block</b> can be prevented by taking opportunities to write {{at the beginning of}} projects, working with a supportive group of people, and cultivating an ongoing interest in writing. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Writer's</b> <b>block</b> is a highly treatable condition. A systematic approach can help to alleviate anxiety, build confidence, and give people the information they need to work productively...|$|R

40|$|My dissertation, Rereading and Rewriting Bloc/ks: Teaching Multi-Modal Literacies {{through an}} Apprenticeship in Proper Names, {{develops}} a new theoretical and pedagogical approach {{for addressing the}} problem of <b>writer’s</b> <b>block.</b> Scholarship that draws on cognitive models of <b>writer’s</b> <b>block</b> measurement from the 1980 s elides the inventive possibilities found in the very literature used to define and measure this condition. One such possibility, suggested {{by the work of}} an often overlooked psychiatrist, Edmund Bergler, who coined the term <b>writer’s</b> <b>block</b> in the 1950 s, is to consider how someone might play with words and homonyms extracted from their own name (i. e., Bergler to Burglar) as a site of invention. Student writers, who often claim to have <b>writer’s</b> <b>block,</b> can harness this insight to draw associations from their names and in so doing connect their writing to more varied and more sophisticated bibliographic networks. The virgule in my bloc/ks both distinguishes my work from the broadly accepted negative condition of <b>writer’s</b> <b>block</b> and the positive groupings that can be formed by blocs. Drawing on figures as diverse as Aristotle and Kenneth Burke, as well as other composition and new media theorists who strategically deploy the play of language, my bloc/ks provide a wide-ranging historic spectrum where the meaning and style of words are perpetually under negotiation. Rather than regarding research in terms of a finite number of sources on a given topic, and rather than jettisoning the term <b>writer’s</b> <b>block</b> altogether, I want to suggest that viewing names as signs of identity that can give rise to an infinite number of inventive resources. ...|$|R
