Businessman Claus Spreckels was {{willing to make the}} arrangements with the United States in exchange for profits from the coin production, and contracted with the US Mint to have $1,000,000 struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.|$|E

25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} flow {{away from the}} shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current {{appears to be an}} area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> beyond the zone of breaking waves.|$|E

500|$|As {{of the end}} of this episode, {{the status}} of three main {{characters}} remained undetermined. Niki Sanders was last seen inside a burning building which subsequently exploded, and Nathan Petrelli was shot while attempting to speak out against the Company. Their fates were left intentionally ambiguous because the writers were unsure of whether they wanted to proceed with Niki and Nathan's characters; decisions were made following the Writers' Strike resolution. As for the fate of Adam Monroe, Kring was more direct, saying [...] "we've given the audience {{no reason to believe that}} Adam can figure a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of there. The fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments. If this happened to any of us, at least we'd know we'd soon have the mercy of death. Not here." [...] Two of the series' villains also saw changes. Elle's decision to take on Sylar gave her a chance to use her abilities to help rather than to hurt people. Kring says [...] "she's been given an opportunity to use her powers in a good way. And she absolutely likes the sound of that word 'hero'." [...] Sylar's use of the stolen sample of Claire Bennet's blood led to the restoration of his abilities. According to Kring, [...] "Sylar getting his power back does not bode well for our heroes." [...] Originally, Sylar was not supposed to get his abilities back due to Zachary Quinto's commitment to the new Star Trek film. However, due to the Writers' Strike, Quinto completed his role in the film by the time Heroes returned to production.|$|E
500|$|A U.S. Army {{recruitment}} officer {{comes to}} the high school to hold an assembly and entices the students with a glamorized, deceptive video presentation, which impresses every one including Chris. Chris returns home and tells the family during dinner that he wants to enlist, but Lois attempts to dissuade him, for the military is not a place for him. The next day, while driving Stewie to Gymboree Play & Music for parachute day, Brian decides to take a detour to the recruitment office to scold the recruiting officer for trying to trick Chris through devious means. The two arrive at the office but the wait is long; when Brian goes to top-up the parking meter [...] Stewie walks into the office. Stewie ends up enlisting in the Army and signs Brian up as well when told there [...] "is a $100 bonus for signing up a buddy." [...] Brian returns and is shocked. Brian and Stewie begin basic training, but Brian becomes stressed from the discipline and decides one night to leave. Stewie wakes up and finds Brian packing his suitcase, but he manages {{to talk him out of}} leaving, insisting that he had never finished anything significant in his life and that the Army will provide him the discipline. With this, Brian decides to stay. After they complete their training, Stewie and Brian are deployed to Iraq. Meantime, the two are patrolling the streets of a village, commenting on the [...] "good situation so far"; however, after the pair get caught up in a terrorist attack, they become dissuaded and decide to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the Army. They first attempt to be discharged by pretending to be homosexual (only to discover that one of their superiors is gay). As a last resort, they attempt to get [...] "Wounded in Action" [...] by shooting each other in the foot; they do this only to find out that the Army now takes anyone no matter what, going so far as to allow two corpses to guard the ammunition. They are then told that democracy has kicked in and the war is over, thus meaning all the soldiers can return to the United States.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer’s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person’s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin’s assumptions we can reformulate the person’s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor’s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E
