The two men <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sneak Daenerys out of Vaes Dothrak, but Daenerys knows that is impossible due to the estimated 100,000 Dothraki present in the city. Instead, she tells them she has a different plan.|$|E

Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E

25|$|In {{the present}} day, President Martinez learns of the facility's {{existence}} {{shortly after his}} inauguration and decides, after meeting {{the leader of the}} detainees, to release them and disclose their existence to the world, despite the objections of the intelligence agencies. His plans are put on hold when an assassination attempt on him is foiled by means beyond human technology. The CIA realizes there are other extraterrestrials and secretly plans to find and detain them. Unknown to the agency, the agent chosen to head the effort is himself one of those extraterrestrials. The escaped extraterrestrials, upon learning of the CIA's plans, have mixed reactions: some <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> salvage attempts to peacefully assimilate, while others want to fight against the populace.|$|E
25|$|Some parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{have a baby}} {{very soon}} after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, {{there may be some}} sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E

I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E

By contrast, Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. They went into the match as holders of the Shield, having defeated Manchester City a year earlier. Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield, when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005. Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011, and [...] Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Arsène Wenger in 13 matches. Mourinho told reporters a winless run was something he would not tolerate: “I would try to answer, not because of a mental block but because I would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find solutions to help my team to do it – {{try to find a}} different way, try to find the reasons why it goes all the time against my team."

500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, but we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E

While close to loans, the element of risk meant that this practice did not actually become usury, except in the case of [...] "dry exchange", where the moving around of money was fictitious. With appropriate issuances of bills, branches could move around money and actually make money. Similarly, they could be fairly certain of a profit when a bill was issued in one of the Italian branches because they could demand a premium of sorts for being asked to deliver money in a far away place at however far in the future usance set the maturation date.

2500|$|If IVF were {{to involve}} the {{fertilisation}} of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then {{this would not be}} an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time. [...] As a result, the couple must {{decide what to do with}} these extra embryos.

Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in stem cell research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.|$|E
2500|$|Development of Rock Band 4 {{began in}} the last quarter of 2014. This {{followed}} from several factors. Harmonix's former CEO and current creative director Alex Rigopulos explained that the studio had awaited both a [...] "critical mass" [...] of adoption for the next-generation consoles, and a [...] "clear and compelling creative vision" [...] for the game before beginning work on a successor—prompting the franchise's hiatus. Rigopulos said that internally if they were going to bring back Rock Band band, they wanted to [...] "really make the best game that we had ever made; that we had a vision for what Rock Band 4 was going to be, that made it worth making, really". A clear vision of the goals for the game came about more than a year prior to the game's release. Harmonix's Greg LoPiccolo added that they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> introduce Rock Band 4 during the new consoles' first year where they would have to compete with major franchises.

On August 19, Akin said that victims of what he termed [...] "legitimate rape" [...] rarely become pregnant.

He replied:Well you know, people always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.|$|E
