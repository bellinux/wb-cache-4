Thus the ratio of two similar quantities {{was not just a}} numerical value, as <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it today; the ratio of two similar quantities was a primitive relationship between them.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{the stable}} model {{semantics}} as {{a description of}} the behavior of Prolog in the presence of negation then programs without a unique stable model can be judged unsatisfactory: they do not provide an unambiguous specification for Prolog-style query answering. For instance, the two programs above are not reasonable as Prolog programs— SLDNF resolution does not terminate on them.|$|E

The central courtyard was used for working, gathering, and sometimes keeping small livestock. An elevated walkway frequently ran around two or three sides of the courtyards in the houses. Such structures afforded protection, and could even be made defensible.|$|E

25|$|Many thinkers are now {{considering}} how Marxist theory affects the way <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> media and vice versa, {{at the same}} time that new media are becoming a major form of communication. Contemporary media theorists often use elements of Marxist theory, such as mediation, to look at how new media affect social relations and lifestyles through their ability to communicate images, sounds, and other forms of information across the globe at incredible speeds.|$|E
25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The {{lumped element}} model, for instance, {{suggests}} that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> circuits {{in terms of}} components with connections between them, with signals flowing instantaneously along the connections. This is a useful view, but not the only possible one. A different ontology arises {{if we need to}} attend to the electrodynamics in the device: Here signals propagate at finite speed and an object (like a resistor) that was previously viewed as a single component with an I/O behavior may now have {{to be thought of as}} an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows.|$|E

50|$|One way to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the ISM is in how {{it applies}} to genome evolution. To {{understand}} the ISM {{as it applies to}} genome evolution, <b>we</b> must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> this model as it applies to chromosomes. Chromosomes are made up of sites, which are nucleotides represented by either A, C, G, or T. While individual chromosomes are not infinite, <b>we</b> must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes as continuous intervals or continuous circles.|$|R
25|$|According to Kant, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you {{ought to have}} done that thing {{that you did not}} do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the {{proposed}} Harvard library transition as {{a manifestation of}} the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.|$|E
25|$|In topology, the Vietoris–Rips complex, {{also called}} the Vietoris complex or Rips complex, is an {{abstract}} simplicial complex that can be defined from any metric space M and distance δ by forming a simplex for every finite set of points that has diameter at most δ. That is, it is a family of finite subsets of M, in which <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a subset of k points as forming a (k1)-dimensional simplex (an edge for two points, a triangle for three points, a tetrahedron for four points, etc.); if a finite set S has the property that the distance between every pair of points in S is at most δ, then we include S as a simplex in the complex.|$|E

25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these {{is the issue of}} power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E
25|$|Experience in South Africa {{had shown}} him that {{underlying}} the difficulties of the situation there was the wider problem of imperial unity. In his farewell speech at Johannesburg he concluded with {{a reference to the}} subject. 'When we who call ourselves Imperialists talk of the British Empire, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a group of states bound, not in an alliance or alliances that can be made and unmade but in a permanent organic union. Of such a union the dominions of the sovereign as they exist to-day are only the raw material.' This thesis he further developed in a magazine article written in view of the colonial conference held in London in 1907. He advocated the creation of a permanent deliberative imperial council, and favored preferential trade relations between the United Kingdom and {{the other members of the}} empire; and in later years he took an active part in advocating the cause of tariff reform and Imperial Preference.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

25|$|When <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{interactivity}} and its meaning, {{we assume}} {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{stems from}} a comment by Dave Mustaine's former Metallica bandmate Lars Ulrich, who {{suggested}} to Mustaine that he should take more [...] "risks" [...] with his music. According to Mustaine, he was also encouraged to experiment by Marty Friedman’s desire to indulge in his pop sensibilities. On the other hand, newcomer Jimmy DeGrasso {{wanted to do a}} [...] "heavy record", unlike the rest of the band who wanted to try out something different. As bassist David Ellefson recalls, the band's manager Bud Prager had told them that they needed [...] "to do something that will make all of their contemporaries knock themselves on the head and say, 'Why didn't <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that'?". This decision resulted in mixed reviews for both the band and the album; a good portion did not favor the new sound and image, while others were more receptive to the band's attempts at experimenting with their sound and trying something different.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{has been}} accused of anti-semitism, {{although}} none of his employeesincluding the animator Art Babbitt, who disliked Disney intenselyever accused him of making anti-semitic slurs or taunts. The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons. Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named [...] "1955 Man of the Year" [...] by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills, and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions. Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-semitism and that Disney was [...] "not [...] in the conventional sense that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> someone as being an anti-Semite". Gabler concludes that [...] "though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic , and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life". Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.|$|E
