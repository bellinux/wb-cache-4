500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} a new [...] {{motorcycle}} was conceived in 1956, when Honda Motor's Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa toured Germany and witnessed the popularity of mopeds and lightweight motorcycles. Soichiro Honda was primarily the engineering and production leader of the company, always with an eye towards winning on the racetrack, while his close partner Fujisawa was the man of finance and business, heading up sales and formulating strategies intended to dominate markets and utterly destroy Honda Motor's competitors. Fujisawa {{had been thinking about}} a long term expansion strategy, and unlike other Japanese companies, {{they did not want to}} simply boost production to cash in on the recent economic boom in Japan. A small, high-performance motorcycle was central to his plans. Upwardly mobile consumers in postwar Europe typically went from a bicycle to a clip-on engine, then bought a scooter, then a bubble car, and then a small car and onwards. Fujisawa saw that a motorcycle did not fit in this pattern for the average person, and he saw an opportunity to change that. Soichiro Honda was at the time tired of listening to Fujisawa talk about his new motorcycle idea; Honda came to Europe to win the Isle of Man TT race and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about little else.|$|E
2500|$|The authors criticize {{those who}} wish to save money by being thrifty. Trump comments, [...] "So many people think cheap and buy cheap. You can get rich by being cheap, but {{who wants to be a}} rich cheap person?" [...] Trump recounts a story about a friend who would always fly in first class no matter his {{financial}} straits, [...] "he needed it mentally. … He wanted to fly first class because mentally, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he was the best. … It put him in a good state of mind and he became a very, very successful guy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you should}} go away in anger this idea of mine about our parting would be but half-realised," [...] she {{returned}} with no drop in her ardour. [...] "No, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of you as feeling a great pain, I don't <b>want</b> even <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of you as making a great sacrifice. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say that, Béla," [...] {{she said}} earnestly, {{and once more}} her little hand grasped his coat-sleeve; [...] "you don't know how it hurts. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Andor. I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of you, and if you would try and be a little patient, I am sure that we would {{understand}} one another better very soon." ...|$|R

2500|$|Difficulties {{continued}} with Lloyd George, {{who had been}} chairman of the Liberal MPs since 1924, over the party leadership and over party funds. In the autumn of 1925 Hobhouse, Runciman and the industrialist Sir Alfred Mond protested to Asquith at Lloyd George organising his own campaign for reform of land ownership. Asquith was [...] "not enthusiastic" [...] but Lloyd George ignored him and arranged for Asquith to be sent reports and calculations ("Lord Oxford likes sums" [...] he wrote). At a meeting on 25 November 1925 Grey, Maclean, Simon, Gladstone and Runciman urged Asquith to have a showdown with Lloyd George over money. Asquith <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it over, and at the December 1925 Federation executive he left the meeting before the topic came up. To the horror of his followers Asquith reached an agreement in principle with Lloyd George over land reform on 2 December, then together they presented plans to the National Liberal Federation on 26 February 1926. But, wrote Maclean, [...] "in private Asquith's language about Lloyd George was lurid." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> respect you," [...] she repeated, more gently. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that--that what we {{feel for}} each other is--unconsecrated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't be helped, of course, but don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{about it}} to-night. Must be {{getting back to}} my dormouse. Good night." ...|$|R

60|$|But Andrew Denton did {{not care}} to talk any more that day. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> and lay quietly until Beth came on duty. To her he gave {{a smile and a}} word of thanks and again lapsed into {{thoughtful}} silence.|$|E
60|$|Rose {{was tired}} but not sleepy and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> over several things, {{so instead of}} going to bed she sat down before the open fire in the study to wait for her uncle and perhaps Charlie, though she did not expect him so late.|$|E
60|$|The sisters sat silent, {{waiting for}} the wedding party to come out. Gudrun was {{impatient}} of talk. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about Gerald Crich. She {{wanted to see if}} the strong feeling she had got from him was real. She wanted to have herself ready.|$|E

60|$|In the morning, after breakfast, James {{went for}} a walk. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out clearly what he had better do, feeling that he must {{make up his mind}} at once. Hesitation would be fatal, and yet to speak {{immediately}} seemed so cruel, so brutally callous.|$|E
