She attended the same progressive girls' school that her mother attended, , in Vienna's First District. However, Manon's irascible behavior, owing much to her free-spirited early childhood—Alma <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go about naked ("stripped") as much as possible—Manon eventually left her boarding school and her education continued at home. Although {{she wanted to be}} an actress, her mother wanted her to have a practical education, too, and Manon, who had become fluent in French and Italian, prepared for the Austrian state exam as a language teacher and translator.|$|E

As {{a result}} of being ostracized due to his condition, and now feeling compassionate, Jack tells Liz to give {{everyone}} a chance to audition, after catching her {{trying to get rid of}} people trying out. During the audition process, Jack, Liz, and Pete witness auditions from TGS staff writers Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J.D. Lutz (John Lutz), NBC news anchor Brian Williams, Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot), the daughter of General Electric (GE) CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn), [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown), former TGS cast member Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and a robot street performer (Daniel Genalo). During Jayden's audition, Liz realizes that Jayden's supposed references—Gilbert Godfried, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Walken—were not legit and that Jayden impersonated them. She confronts him about this, however, Jayden plans to blackmail Liz with a camera marked by her fingerprints—that features provocative photos of Jayden, to make it look like Liz would only hire him if he <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> take pictures of his genitals. Liz tries to stop Jack from casting Jayden, though Jack has made up his mind in hiring the robot street performer. Jack casts him after he shook his hand without being concerned that Jack had bedbugs.|$|E
2500|$|Witnesses saw a {{teenager}} cycling away from Carole Voyce's crime scene, and an accurate composite sketch was created {{based on those}} witnesses' descriptions. This sketch ran {{on the front page}} of the Toronto Star and would lead to Woodcock's arrest on January 21, 1957, and his subsequent confession to all three murders. He recalled upon his arrest: [...] "My fear was that Mother would find out. Mother was my biggest fear. I didn't know if the police <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> at me." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 1, 2006, Carroll {{released}} a statement through the website of the Christian Science Monitor, stating she {{had participated in the}} video critical of the United States and praiseworthy of her abductors only because she feared for her life and because her captors said they <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> go if she participated to their satisfaction. [...] "Things that I was forced to say while captive are now being taken by some as an accurate reflection of my personal views. They are not." [...] Carroll called her captors [...] "criminals, at best" [...] and said she remains [...] "deeply angry" [...] with them.|$|E
2500|$|During Osbourne's {{appearance}} on The Graham Norton Show, she stated, {{in reference to}} Minogue, [...] "She knows she's there because of her looks, not because of her contribution to the music industry." [...] In a press conference held on 12 December 2007, when asked why she had been publicly talking about Minogue, Osbourne said [...] "It's an even playing field, Dannii speaks about me, I speak about her." [...] Minogue said in turn [...] "I've looked up to Sharon and Louis for years and I {{wanted to be part}} of that gang. But when they're slating you, you think: 'Please don't, I really like you.'" [...] Cowell admitted that Osbourne did not feel comfortable about having a new judge and that Osbourne and Minogue would never be [...] "the best of buddies," [...] adding that if Osbourne wanted to leave the show, he <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> (in fact, Osbourne left after series 4). The Daily Mail reported that Cowell was forced to sit the judges down, asking them to maintain a civil relationship with each other behind the scenes. The apparent flirting between Cowell and Minogue also generated comment in the popular media.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the premiere}} {{episode of the}} second season, [...] "Amok Time", Spock begins to undergo pon farr, the Vulcan blood fever, and must undergo a ritual mating in the next eight days or die. Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders and takes the Enterprise to the planet Vulcan so that Spock can undergo the mating ritual. When they arrive, he is reunited with T'Pring (Arlene Martel). She rather wishes to be with Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne), a full-blooded Vulcan. She demands the ritual kal-if-fee fight instead, and selects Kirk as her champion, who unknowingly agrees to a {{fight to the death}} with Spock. McCoy persuades T'Pau (Celia Lovsky) to let him inject Kirk with {{something}} to alleviate the issues with Vulcan's thinner atmosphere and make the fight fair. The fight begins, and Spock gains the upper hand, garroting Kirk and killing him. McCoy orders an emergency transport directly to sickbay, while Spock is told by T'Pring that it was all a game of logic which <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> be with Stonn no matter the outcome. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the Enterprise where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive.|$|E

2500|$|When Cameron first {{appeared}} in the pilot episode, she behaved with more human mannerisms, but these faded in subsequent episodes. It has been confirmed by Friedman that this behavioral change {{was the result of a}} conscious decision; however the explanations he has given of the logistics behind this decision have varied. At the Television Critics Association press tour, he stated that within the story, Cameron had been prepared for the events of the pilot. Once the characters [...] "jumped forward in time though, she was as adrift as everyone else". In an interview with IGN, Friedman stated that as he wrote the second episode, he became interested in exploring the [...] "calmer, odder part of" [...] Cameron, reflected in a scene in the pilot in which Cameron asks questions of John [...] "in a very programmed way". He continued to say that Cameron's behavior may appear inconsistent to a viewer, but that this inconsistency may be operative in the completion of her tasks. In any case, the character's robotic interactions with humans were manipulated for humor, but Friedman did express a wish to avoid [...] "cheap jokes" [...] in favor of more seriously exploring Cameron's existence as a cyborg. Summer Glau in an interview said about Cameron's changing behavior: [...] "We were experimenting with Cameron quite a bit, and we wanted her to be able to seem human. We wanted especially John to be fooled by her, so that he <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> into his life. And so in the pilot, I do act very human. And then as I go through the series, it appears that I’ve taken steps back and that I am acting more like a Terminator would. We did that for several different reasons, but I know for me it's fun because I get to take more time for her development, her human development. I think that it also is funny and I think once her cover was blown with the Connors, she kind of was able to drop that persona and become who she really is around them, if that answers the question." ...|$|E
