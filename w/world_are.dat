5000|$|Modal realism is {{the view}} propounded by David Kellogg Lewis that all {{possible}} <b>worlds</b> <b>are</b> as real as the actual <b>world.</b> It <b>is</b> based on the following tenets: possible worlds exist; possible <b>worlds</b> <b>are</b> not different in kind from the actual world; possible <b>worlds</b> <b>are</b> irreducible entities; the term actual in actual <b>world</b> <b>is</b> indexical, i.e. any subject can declare their <b>world</b> to <b>be</b> the actual one, much as theylabel the place they are [...] "here" [...] and {{the time they are}} [...] "now".|$|R
5|$|Governments {{around the}} <b>world</b> <b>are</b> {{considering}} {{a range of}} waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, {{although there has been}} limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions.

5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training.

5|$|After a {{tentative}} creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution {{in the creation}} of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux.

5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, {{sleight of hand}} is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world.

Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known around the <b>world</b> <b>are</b> publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E

In these cultures, many of which have strongly animist traditions full of legends and stories in which many aspects of the natural <b>world</b> <b>are</b> associated with spirits, the sea otter was considered particularly kin to humans. The Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida, and other First Nations of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. Sea otter pelts were given in potlatches to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved sea otter bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered sea otter baculum as a medicine for fever.|$|E

As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis.
