5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E

Since that season, the average has dropped {{down to the}} 90s. Only two post-1995 games make the top-ten lists of both {{the regular season and}} playoffs: a May 10, 2003 game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Sacramento Kings and a December 7, 2006 game between the Phoenix Suns and New Jersey Nets. Both the Mavericks and the Suns were coached by Nelson and Mike D'Antoni respectively, both of whom also made use of the run and gun style.|$|E

In February she set Cuban indoor records of 4.60m at the Pole Vault Stars meet, 4.71m at the Meeting Pas de Calais, then 4.72m at the XL Galan, finishing in the top three each time.

25|$|Attewell first {{played for}} Nottinghamshire in 1881 {{as a result}} of a strike by senior players such as Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley. He bowled very well but did not {{establish}} himself until 1884 after Morley had died, when he took 100 wickets for less than thirteen runs each. From then on, Attewell <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front rank of English bowlers, and after Shaw dropped out of the Nottinghamshire eleven in early 1887 he became the undisputed leader of the county's attack. His first Ashes tour was modest, partly owing to the dry weather, but he continued improving in England – taking 9 for 23 against Sussex at Trent Bridge in 1886 – and toured Australia again in 1887/1888. He proved deadly in a wet La Niña season in minor games, but had no opportunity of showing his deadliness on a sticky wicket at the highest level because Lohmann and Briggs were so effective. However, Attewell's skill and economy, along with the brilliant batting of Shrewsbury, allowed Nottinghamshire to maintain their position as one of the top counties in first-class county cricket right up to the end of 1892.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{its history}} Fittipaldi Automotive was entirely {{focussed}} around Emerson Fittipaldi. Emerson was a double world champion renowned for a smooth and quick style {{when he joined the}} family team. Although his older brother drove in the team's first season, the suggestion that Emerson might drive for the team <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and only a year later he cancelled contract discussions with his then team McLaren at a very late stage and signed with Fittipaldi. Although he remained capable of front-running performances, during his time with Fittipaldi Automotive he became an inconsistent performer. On several occasions team manager Jo Ramírez berated his driver after a sudden burst of speed indicated that he had not been driving to his full potential. By 1980 Fittipaldi's team mate Keke Rosberg thought him long past his best, and found him demotivated. Emerson retired {{at the end of that}} year after five full seasons with the family team. Like fellow world champion Jacques Villeneuve’s five-year stint with the BAR team set up for him with BAT money in 1998, the partnership ended the front running Formula One career of a young and highly competitive driver, although he would later build a very successful career in top level American single seater racing in the CART series.|$|E

500|$|Gatiss has criticised recent {{television}} {{adaptations of}} the Conan Doyle stories as [...] "too reverential and too slow", aiming instead {{to be as}} irreverent to the canon as the 1930s and 1940s films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, which were mostly set in the then contemporary interwar era. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet and GPS to solve crimes. Paul McGuigan, who directed two episodes of Sherlock, says that this {{is in keeping with}} Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that [...] "n the books he would use any device possible and he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lab doing experiments.

500|$|By 1949, Feynman was {{becoming}} restless at Cornell. He never {{settled into a}} particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends [...] "until these arrangements became sexually volatile". He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends. He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and pined for a warmer climate. Above all, at Cornell, he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow of Hans Bethe. Feynman did, however, look back favorably on the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as [...] "a group of boys [...] have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it's there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize.|$|E

500|$|For his four-year-old debut, Mucho Macho Man ran at Gulfstream Park, {{defeating}} Ron the Greek in the Sunshine Millions Classic, a race {{restricted to}} horses bred in Florida or California. He had finally grown into his tall frame. Dominguez returned as his jockey and {{was pleased with}} what he saw, saying, [...] "You can really tell how much he's grown up since I rode him in the Belmont.

[...] Dominguez further described him as [...] "forward" [...] out of the gate and said the race was an [...] "easy" [...] win. [...] He raced again in March, winning the Grade II Gulfstream Park Handicap by two lengths. In May at Churchill Downs, he finished third behind Successful Dan and Fort Larned in the Grade II Alysheba Stakes, carrying top weight of [...] His next race was the Grade II Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park on July 7. Ridden for the first time by Mike Smith, who was his jockey {{for the remainder of the}} year, he took the lead in the straight and won by 2.5lengths. It was considered his most significant win of the year. [...] In the Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on September 1, he finished second by a neck, having been pushed toward the outside of the track by the winner, To Honor and Serve, in the final furlong. On November 3, Mucho Macho Man was one of twelve horses to contest the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita in California. Starting at odds of 6–1, he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first two and finished second, half a length behind Fort Larned. There was a -length gap back to the other runners, who included Flat Out, Game On Dude, To Honor and Serve, and Ron The Greek.

500|$|Calling {{the show}} a [...] "theatrical {{multimedia}} spectacular", Madonna wanted a huge stage {{with a central}} platform from which {{a flight of stairs}} descended. The central [...] platform was flanked by two lower platforms, which housed the band and the musicians. A large video screen was suspended above the stairs, which descended during the show. Two projectors were situated {{at the front of the}} stage, which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show. Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes. She took inputs from her then husband, actor Sean Penn saying, [...] "I really respect Sean's opinion. He has great taste and is a very brilliant man. When I was putting my tour together, it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of my mind: 'I wonder what Sean will think of this?'
