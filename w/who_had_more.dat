5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} major league pitcher to pitch four no-hitters and the eighth pitcher to pitch a perfect game in {{baseball}} history. Despite his comparatively short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers. Koufax, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, and Nolan Ryan are the only four pitchers elected to the Hall of Fame <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> strikeouts than innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Sabuktigin died in 997, and was {{succeeded by}} his son Ismail as the ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty. Mahmud, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> {{administrative}} experience than his brother, claimed the throne for himself, and the following year managed to defeat his brother and gain control over the Ghaznavid dynasty. Mahmud quickly began increasing his independence from the Samanids, and eventually divided the Samanid state with the Karakhanids, ending the Samanid dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Following the CONCACAF Qualifying tournament, Sauerbrunn {{was named}} to the 24-player roster for the International Tournament of Brasilia in Brazil that took place from December 10 to 21. Sauerbrunn started all four games of the tournament. She was named Budweiser Woman of the Match for the team's opening match against China, which {{resulted}} in a 1–1 draw. In the final against Brazil, Sauerbrunn made a header off of a corner kick by Megan Rapinoe, but the shot was saved by Luciana, Brazil's goalkeeper. The game was a 0–0 draw, but the tournament title was given to Brazil, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> points from the group stage.|$|E
5|$|The KMSHA {{was founded}} in 1989. In 2002, a {{subsidiary}} organization, the SMHA, was formed to register horses <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> white markings than were allowed by the KMSHA. As of 2011, the KMSHA has over 3,200 members and has registered over 24,000 horses. The majority of the horses are in Kentucky, but the breed is also seen throughout the US, {{as well as in}} Canada and a small population in Europe. The KMSHA and SMHA host a joint championship show each year at the Kentucky Horse Park.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of development, Slither.io was {{released}} for browsers and iOS on March 25, 2016, with servers supporting up to 500 players. Two days after the iOS/browser versions' release, an Android version was made available by Lowtech Studios. The only way Howse could make revenue was to display advertising in the app after the player's snake died; this option could be removed for US$3.99. He chose not to sell virtual currency or power-ups so that those who paid would not have an advantage over players who didn't. As {{there was no money}} to advertise for the game, the only way to advertise was the various let's plays by players on YouTube, including PewDiePie, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> than 47 million subscribers at the time.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Richmond {{convention}} opened, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document clause by clause, which may have played {{into the hands of}} the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason's motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times in the discussion, on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted the president would use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in the federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future Chief Justice of the United States, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, the late-18th century Bastille was not greatly {{changed from}} its 14th-century predecessor. The eight stone towers had {{gradually}} acquired individual names: {{running from the}} north-east side of the external gate, these were La Chapelle, Trésor, Comté, Bazinière, Bertaudière, Liberté, Puits and Coin. La Chapelle contained the Bastille's chapel, decorated with a painting of Saint Peter in chains. Trésor took {{its name from the}} reign of Henry IV, when it had contained the royal treasury. The origins of the name of Comté tower are unclear; one theory is that the name refers to the County of Paris. Bazinière was named after Bertrand de La Bazinière, a royal treasurer who was imprisoned there in 1663. Bertaudière was named after a medieval mason who died building the structure in the 14th century. Liberté tower took its name either from a protest in 1380, when Parisians shouted the phrase outside the castle, or because it was used to house prisoners <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> freedom to walk around the castle than the typical prisoner. Puits tower contained the castle well, while Coin formed the corner of the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E
5|$|Di Grassi {{took over}} the lead with d'Ambrosio second; both drivers were half a lap ahead of the battling drivers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> {{available}} electrical energy. Félix da Costa and his teammate Frijns joined the leading group of drivers after being under the minimum pit stop time by three seconds. The safety was deployed for the third (and final) time when Duval stopped on track after leaving the chicane with a battery issue, prematurely ending his race. This allowed the field to close up to di Grassi and d'Ambrosio. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead at the restart. Vergne immediately pushed hard and attempted to pass López for third but the two drivers made contact at the turn three chicane. He attempted the same manoeuvre one lap later but López cut the chicane to avoid hitting Vergne and the latter demanded on his radio that López cede the position. Both Andretti cars were investigated because their pit stop times were faster the minimum permitted time of one minute because the team believed it was 57 seconds. López drew near to d'Ambrosio and Vergne remained close behind López. The battle allowed di Grassi {{to pull away from}} the field. Félix da Costa slowed and stopped his car on the 33rd lap with a broken driveshaft, causing him to retire. His teammate Frijns was issued with a drive-through penalty for being below the minimum pit stop time. Two laps later, López pushed hard and steered onto the outside line in an attempt to pass d'Ambrosio but spun under braking for the first corner, sliding off into the turn's run-off area. Buemi activated FanBoost and lined up an overtake on Rosenqvist (who locked his front tyres) but spun under braking for turn one, and narrowly avoided striking López's stranded car. Both drivers fell down the order. The electrical power in Engel's car depleted slowly after exiting turns five and six, ending his race. Buemi recorded the race's fastest lap on lap 40, completing a circuit at one minute and 3.102 seconds. This earned him one championship point. D'Ambrosio continued to hold back Vergne and the remaining seven cars behind him had more electrical energy available. D'Ambrosio locked his tyres under braking for the first corner, allowing Vergne to pass him for second place. Vergne then started to draw closer to di Grassi.|$|E

25|$|Survival {{opportunities}} open to {{the larger}} Soviet community included bartering and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> food to spare, were eager to trade with Soviet citizens that had extra warm clothes to trade. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens got to keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 10th century, between the fall of Tang Dynasty and the rise of Song, there was brisk trading between the {{overseas}} world with the Fujian kingdom of Min and the rich Guangdong kingdom of Nan Han. Srivijaya undoubtedly benefited from this. Sometime around 903 CE, the Muslim writer Ibn Rustah was so impressed with the wealth of the Srivijayan ruler that he declared that one would not hear of a king who was richer, stronger or <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> revenue. The main urban centres of Srivijaya were then at Palembang (especially the Karanganyar site near Bukit Seguntang area), Muara Jambi and Kedah.|$|E
