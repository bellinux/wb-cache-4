5|$|Another, short {{wall was}} added in later times, {{probably}} in the reign of Theophilos, stretching from the junction {{of the land and}} sea walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (Ξυλίνη πύλη, Xylinē pylē, or Ξυλόπορτα, Xyloporta). Both this <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gate were demolished in 1868.|$|E

5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the Cog Railway ascends is {{straightforward}} from base to summit, the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, the City proper—the area bounded by the City <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River Thames—was {{only a part}} of London, {{covering}} some , and home to about 80,000 people, or one sixth of London's inhabitants. The City was surrounded by a ring of inner suburbs where most Londoners lived. The City was then, as now, the commercial heart of the capital, and was the largest market and busiest port in England, dominated by the trading and manufacturing classes.|$|E
5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} front wall and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall {{to the end of}} the bench.

The cave has two cisterns.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Western Road {{was built}} along the {{southern}} edge of the castle. This required the demolition of part of the castle <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fortified bridge, and the weakening of the foundations caused the subsequent collapse of the south-eastern tower later that year. The town of Launceston declined in importance in the 19th century and from 1823 onwards the county gaol, which had a reputation for filthy and unhealthy conditions, began to be run down in favour of the facility at Bodmin Gaol. In 1838 the county government and the assizes were moved to Bodmin, which was more centrally located in Cornwall, resulting in the closure of the castle's gaol and its final demolition in 1842.|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{services}} at the station declined following the Second World War, and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line. Passenger {{services at}} Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services following on 5 July 1965, although the line saw occasional traffic until 1981. Most of the station was demolished, leaving some remains of the platforms, a retaining <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> footbridge. Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock {{was connected to the}} rail network. The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic in 2019 as part of MetroWest, but there are no plans to reopen the station.|$|E
5|$|Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn {{investigate}} a mysterious black ice cave, fearing that Finn and Jake {{may have been}} captured by the Ice King on a routine expedition. Once inside the cave, Lady and Bubblegum enter into a biologically-engineered dungeon and are attacked by mysterious hand-like creatures that attempt to grab them. Lady manages to phase through a <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two hear the Ice King's voice coming from a ventilation shaft. Inside the shaft, the two are attacked by a giant tongue before they enter into a room covered with eyes. As Bubblegum and Lady approach the room's exit, the eyes activate and shoot laser at the duo, incapacitating Lady.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} in 1097 King WilliamII ordered a wall {{to be built}} around the Tower of London; it was {{probably}} built from stone {{as a replacement for}} the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Thames. The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons. The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Museum houses an in situ mosaic {{pavement}} {{dating from}} around 300 AD. Surviving structures from the Roman times include Queningate, a blocked gate {{in the city}} <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dane John Mound, once part of a Roman cemetery. The Dane John Gardens were built beside the mound in the 18th century, and a memorial {{was placed on the}} mound's summit. A windmill was on the mound between 1731 and 1839.|$|E
5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E

5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western <b>Wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts. More than a million prayer notes are {{placed in the}} Western Wall each year.|$|E
5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form {{was laid out}} on a plain plaster base coating on the <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|The mansion, {{abandoned}} due {{to rising}} costs, was demolished in 1972, allowing Wallingford Castle to be declared a scheduled monument {{as well as}} a Grade I listed building. The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> motte hill, are now open to the public. An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010, aiming to better understand the historical transition from the Anglo-Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh, to the period of the Norman castle.|$|E
