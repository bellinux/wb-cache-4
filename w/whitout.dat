5000|$|The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 is {{very compact}} {{as it is}} {{designed}} to operate in the Swiss Air Force's aircraft caverns (or underground hangars). It runs on diesel fuel to lower the risk of fire. For precise maneuvering around the caverns, pilot tunnels and shelters it is equipped with special downward-shining floor lighting headlights to help the driver to follow floor markings.It is also used to provide a power supply to aircraft <b>whitout</b> an Auxiliary power unit. It is used as well as tractors for about 1-4 engine start units or for ad hoc transport of mechanics and tools (e.g. spare wheel and jack by a flat tire of a landed aircraft). JuAir at Dübendorf Air Base is the only civil user of this aircraft tug type. The aircraft tractors are equipped with four quick couplings as standard. This allows them to be loaded with a crane, in a short time, on every flatbed truck of the Swiss military. The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 are street-legal, but with their 80km range and permitted maximum speed of 25 km/h, however, are not independently suitable for ad-hoc transfers. An ad-hoc capability was achieved with the 4 crane couplings. Such ad-hoc transfers were part of the concept of the Swiss Air Force in the Cold War. It was anticipated to use various motorway sections of the Motorways of Switzerland as air force bases. This was also done several times in exercises. In these exercises the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 was involved. For example, the [...] "U TAUTO" [...] exercise on March 24, 1982, the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 were stationed at the Rest area [...] "Windrose" [...] near Münsingen.

30|$|The dataset {{consisted}} of 936 medical files, 853 being eligible. Early tracheostomy was quite common, with an incidence of 49.2 %. Patients were propensity matched {{based on their}} association with death and early tracheostomy. Of the 853 patients collected, patients with early tracheostomy after admission (n = 419, 49.2 %), and late tracheostomy (n= 434, 50.8 %) were matched in two groups. These two groups were well balanced with respect to all variables collected. The early tracheostomy group had at decreased risk of mortality at ICU discharge, relative risk ratio: 0.78; 95 % CI (0.78 -. 97) with a decreased risk of 22 % vs the late tracheostomy group who had a increase risk of death at ICU discharge, relative risk ratio: 1.15; 95 % CI (1.05 - 1.17). No significant differences in mortality were found at 28 days and no diferences in complications.

The fate of famoxadone was studied by considering the decay ratio of this fungicide during thematuration of rapes and wine production. The main factors affecting the presence of fungicide residues such as fruit growth, photodegradation, evaporation, thermodegradation and co-distillation were studied with model system. An experimental field was treated with a commercial product containing famoxdone at the recommended dose. After this application residues of famoxadone were found in grapes at 0. 27 ± 0. 06 mgkg- 1. In this field experiment the half-life (t½) of famoxadone, which is described by pseudo-first-order kinetics (R 2 = 0. 74) was 18 ± 6 days, resulting from photodegradation.
