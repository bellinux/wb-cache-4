5|$|Another {{crucial role}} in the Clan is that of the deputy. When a new Clan leader is appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role. The deputy of a Clan is {{generally}} in charge of less urgent, but still important duties, such as deciding which cats will go on a hunting patrol and which will check the borders. Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice. When a Clan leader dies, the current deputy <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the new role of leader, and receive their nine lives from StarClan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} Adventure, {{the player}} reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall {{belonging}} to Maxwell on it. The player finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him, but finds a keyhole, {{as well as a}} key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as soon as he stands up. The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare them in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using newfound powers given by the throne, but will nonetheless be trapped forever.|$|E

5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which quantum state the first particle <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E

25|$|With version 6.0, if the Desktop Experience {{component}} is {{plugged into the}} remote server, remote application user interface elements (e.g., application windows borders, Maximize, Minimize, and Close buttons etc.) <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the same appearance of local applications. In this scenario, the remote applications will use the Aero theme if the user connects to the server from a Windows Vista machine running Aero. Later versions of the protocol also support rendering the UI in full 32-bit color, as well as resource redirection for printers, COM ports, disk drives, mice and keyboards. With resource redirection, remote applications can use {{the resources of the}} local computer. Audio is also redirected, so that any sounds generated by a remote application are played back at the client system. Moreover, a remote session can also span multiple monitors at the client system, independent of the multi-monitor settings at the server. RDC {{can also be used to}} connect to Windows Media Center (WMC) remote sessions; however, since WMC does not stream video using RDP, only the applications can be viewed this way, not any media.|$|E
25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at {{the hands of a}} single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> increased importance. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a single power. The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.|$|E

2500|$|MPT {{assumes that}} investors are risk averse, meaning that given two {{portfolios}} that {{offer the same}} expected return, investors will prefer the less risky one. [...] Thus, an investor <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns. Conversely, an investor who wants higher expected returns must accept more risk. The exact trade-off {{will be the same}} for all investors, but different investors will evaluate the trade-off differently based on individual risk aversion characteristics. [...] The implication is that a rational investor will not invest in a portfolio if a second portfolio exists with a more favorable risk-expected return profile – i.e., if for that level of risk an alternative portfolio exists that has better expected returns.|$|E

Prior to the verdict the Belgian ambassador to Serbia, Denise de Hauwere, said Belgium hoped Belgrade would act wisely after the ICJ opinion was given saying [...] "good relations with Kosovo are vital for Europe and that Belgium wants Serbia in the European Union, but that Serbia's fate is in its own hands. We expect that the reaction of all sides that are involved will be constructive." [...] The Belgian Foreign Minister Steven Vanackere also reiterated his call in that he [...] "hopes that all the parties concerned will react responsibly and <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> board {{the opinion of the}} International Court of Justice".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the higher}} {{boundaries}} of subalpine ecosystem, where the abiotic conditions are more stressful, trees are clumped together in patchy islands. Trees {{in this area}} can be recognized by its krummholz form. [...] Trees of this upper boundary <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a flag appearance with branches extending from one side indicating the prevailing wind directions. [...] The skirt height of the trees {{is indicative of the}} height of snow cover where branches tend not to grow. There are various reasons as to why these trees take this form. [...] Strong winds combined with ice particles will cause abrasion scouring the waxy cuticle {{from one side of the}} tree creating damage that will prevent branch formation and growth. In addition, the wind will cause desiccation and evaporation in the needles causing branches to die on this side of the trees.|$|E
2500|$|An {{organisation}} {{with just}} one person cannot have any duplication of effort between employees. If there are two employees, {{there could be some}} duplication of efforts, but this is likely to be minor, as each of the two will generally know what the other is working on. When organisations grow to thousands of workers, it is inevitable that someone, or even a team, <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a function that is already being handled by another person or team. In colloquial terms, this is described as [...] "one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing". General Motors, for example, developed two in-house CAD/CAM systems: CADANCE was designed by the GM Design Staff, while Fisher Graphics was created by the former Fisher Body division. These similar systems later needed to be combined into a single Corporate Graphics System, CGS, at great expense. A smaller firm would have had neither the money to allow such expensive parallel developments, nor the lack of communication and cooperation which precipitated this event. In addition to CGS, GM also used CADAM, UNIGRAPHICS, CATIA and other off-the-shelf CAD/CAM systems, thus increasing the cost of translating designs from one system to another. This endeavor eventually became so unmanageable that they acquired (and then eventually sold off) Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in an effort to control the situation. Smaller firms typically choose a single off-the-shelf CAD/CAM system, with no need to combine or translate between systems.|$|E
2500|$|Rugby league – In 1991, the NSWRL came to Adelaide Oval {{when the}} St. George Dragons played the Balmain Tigers {{on a cold}} and wet Friday night under {{temporary}} lights {{in the first of}} five games that the Dragons would play at the oval over the next five years. That game, with the Dragons winning 16–2, set a rugby league record crowd for the ground when 28,884 people attended, and was in fact the highest minor round attendance for the 1991 NSWRL season (beaten only by four of the six Finals series games including the Grand Final). In 1997 Adelaide got its own side in the much vaunted (but short lived) Super League competition with the Adelaide Rams. Their first home game attracted their record crowd when 27,435 saw the Rams defeat SL's other new team, the Hunter Mariners 10–8. However, after disputes over money (and dwindling crowds due to poor on-field results) they left the ground in 1998 and moved to Hindmarsh Stadium. In the 2010 and 2011 National Rugby League seasons, Sydney club the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs played home games at the Oval against the Melbourne Storm. The Bulldogs had intended to make Adelaide Oval their second [...] "home" [...] (the club plays its home games at Sydney's Olympic Stadium), but the plan was abandoned after 2010. On November 20, 2016, it was announced that the Sydney Roosters <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the Melbourne Storm in the 2017 NRL season meaning that top level Rugby league returned to Adelaide {{for the first time since}} 2011. The Roosters won the game, played on 24 June in Round 16 of the season, 25–24 in golden point extra time in front of a crowd of 21,492 fans.|$|E
