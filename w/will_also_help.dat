5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not just seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last longer than that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) machinery offers inherent protection {{to the cell}} against nucleotide base mismatch. Therefore, any mutations introduced in the oligonucleotides can be targeted by the MMR. There {{are several ways to}} avoid this. First, the use of an E. coli strain that is MMR deficient will eradicate this issue. However, this also results in a higher rate of other random mutations throughout the genome. Another method to reduce mismatch repair is to bury the mutations of interest within other silent mutations. Since silent mutations do not often cause catastrophic effects, they are poorly detected by the MMR machinery. The presence of modified bases <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to evade the MMR machinery because they are not recognized. Finally, long segments of mutations will be less affected by short segments of mutations.|$|E

25|$|However, simple {{husbandry}} {{changes and}} practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock {{during times of}} maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The Culicoides midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, mending leaks and filling in or draining damp areas <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> dry up breeding sites. Control by trapping midges and removing their breeding grounds may reduce vector numbers. Dung heaps or slurry pits should be covered or removed, and their perimeters (where most larvae are found) regularly scraped.|$|E
25|$|Older offspring, {{which are}} around two years old, may also live in {{families}} and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year-olds <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring. Beavers also practice alloparental care, {{in which an}} older sibling may take over the parenting duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species, such as the elephant and fathead minnow. While these helping two-year-olds help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family, and two-year-olds only stay and help their families {{if there is a}} shortage of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought. When beavers leave their natal territories, they usually do not settle far. Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell. Related beavers share more features in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beavers. Being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior, and it causes more tolerant behavior among neighboring beavers.|$|E
25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of malic acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the off-premise {{catering}} makes it essential that caterer obtain customer satisfaction for long term survival. Customer satisfaction can be seen when they create favorable future post-purchase action such as repeat the experienced service and they disseminate the positive information to others. From the above notion, this study attempted to identify how quality and monetary price is perceived in relation to satisfaction and post-purchase action in off-premise catering. A questionnaires were distributed to 250 customers from 10 selected off-premise catering in Shah Alam. A series of analyses using descriptive and inferential were {{used to analyze the}} data. The results indicate both antecedents have a positive effects on the customer satisfaction and post-purchase action. Results of this analysis will contribute to the services marketing theory by providing additional insights into quality and price, satisfaction, post-purchase action. It <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> caterers to develop and implement market-oriented service strategies for increasing their profit. Thus, caterers should consider the quality and price dimensions that elicit customer satisfaction and post-purchase action...|$|R
25|$|Gas vacuoles are membrane-bound, {{spindle-shaped}} vesicles, {{found in}} some planktonic bacteria and Cyanobacteria, that provides buoyancy to these cells by decreasing their overall cell density. Positive buoyancy is {{needed to keep the}} cells in {{the upper reaches of the}} water column, so that they can continue to perform photosynthesis. They are made up of a shell of protein that has a highly hydrophobic inner surface, making it impermeable to water (and stopping water vapour from condensing inside) but permeable to most gases. Because the gas vesicle is a hollow cylinder, it is liable to collapse when the surrounding pressure increases. Natural selection has fine tuned the structure of the gas vesicle to maximise its resistance to buckling, including an external strengthening protein, GvpC, rather like the green thread in a braided hosepipe. There is a simple relationship between the diameter of the gas vesicle and pressure at which it will collapse - the wider the gas vesicle the weaker it becomes. However, wider gas vesicles are more efficient, providing more buoyancy per unit of protein than narrow gas vesicles. Different species produce gas vesicle of different diameter, allowing them to colonise different depths of the water column (fast growing, highly competitive species with wide gas vesicles in the top most layers; slow growing, dark-adapted, species with strong narrow gas vesicles in the deeper layers). The diameter of the gas vesicle <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> determine which species survive in different bodies of water. Deep lakes that experience winter mixing expose the cells to the hydrostatic pressure generated by the full water column. This will select for species with narrower, stronger gas vesicles.|$|E
25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young people look forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her wonder at the change in her life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if she is really in love – with a complete stranger. Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds and he looks forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E
