The map covered the wide area stretching from Lake Superior to the Pacific, and was given by Thompson to the North West Company. Thompson's 1814 map, his greatest achievement, was so accurate that 100 years later it was still the basis {{for many of the}} maps issued by the Canadian government. It now resides in the Archives of Ontario.|$|E
25|$|This Mountain dog comes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> double coat; the Leonberger is a large, muscular, {{and elegant}} dog with {{balanced}} body type, medium temperament, and dramatic presence.

Remaining true to their early roots as a capable family and working dog and {{search and rescue dog}} (particularly water), the surprisingly agile Leonberger is sound and coordinated, with both strength in bearing and elegance in movement. A dimorphic breed, the Leonberger possesses either a strongly masculine or elegantly feminine form, making gender immediately discernible.|$|E
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the SH09 is {{designed}} to provide pilots <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> field of view and simplify the act of operating the rotorcraft. A Sagem-built ICDS-8A glass cockpit suite is an integrated part of the SH09's standard avionics and instrumentation package. The rotorcraft has been designed with a condition-based maintenance policy, specifying {{that there should be no}} time between overhaul (TBO) limits on its various components and systems, including the engine; instead, maintenance is performed based upon condition, which is continuously monitored at all times by an onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS). Ease of maintenance and access to systems was an active consideration during the design phase, aiming to deliver lower overall maintenance costs.|$|E

25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the TBM seats {{a pair of}} flying crew. According to Flying Magazine, even in the {{standard}} configuration, the cockpit is provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> suite of avionics and equipment. It features an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), {{traffic collision avoidance system}} (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, lightning detection, dual Garmin GNS 530 navigation/communication systems, Bose headsets, dual transponders, dual compasses, and full cockpit instrumentation for both positions. Pilots can enter the cockpit either from the main cabin or via a small pilot's door on the left hand side, forward of the wing; in a cargo configuration, the pilot's door eliminates the need to clamber over the cargo payload. The pilot's door is an optional extra, and is not installed upon all aircraft. From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin entry door was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E

500|$|Such was {{the quality}} of Henson's {{scholarship}} that his history tutor encouraged him to enter the annual competition for appointment as a Fellow of All Souls, the university's post-graduate research college. He was appointed in November 1884, {{at the age of}} twenty. Membership of the college offered an annual stipend of £200; for the first time, Henson was in reasonably comfortable financial circumstances. At All Souls, he later wrote, [...] "I was welcomed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> kindness which made me feel immediately at home. I formed friendships which have enriched my life." [...] His biographer John Peart-Binns suggests that Henson may nonetheless have remained something of an outsider, his arrival at All Souls [...] "akin to that of an alien". The college was headed by the Warden, Sir William Anson, who became something of a father figure to Henson, and encouraged his researches. Henson's first paper, on William II of England, marked him out as not only a fine scholar but a gripping speaker when he delivered it to an audience. Aware that his quick tongue could lead him into indiscretion, he adopted and maintained all his life the practice of writing out his lectures and sermons in full beforehand rather than improvising or speaking from concise notes. He preferred a quill pen, and wrote in a fine clear hand; he considered illegible writing to be a form of bad manners as tiresome as inaudible talking. He gained a reputation as a controversialist. In a biographical sketch, Harold Begbie wrote that at Oxford Henson was nicknamed [...] "Coxley Cocksure"; he added: ...|$|E

50|$|Welles's {{relations}} with RKO grew strained during {{the making of}} this film. His stock had fallen considerably after Kane had commercially flopped. Whereas studio head George Schaefer had given Welles carte blanche over Kane, he closely supervised Ambersons, sensing that his own position was in danger (which indeed it was - Schaefer was fired as head of RKO shortly after Ambersons was completed, and a commonly-attributed reason was for his having hired Welles <b>with</b> such <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> contract). RKO itself was in serious financial trouble, running a deficit.|$|R

5|$|Having been proclaimed emperor {{solely on}} the {{initiative}} of the Senate, Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace. As was custom by this time, a change of emperor was expected to bring <b>with</b> it <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> payment of gifts and money {{to the people and}} the army. Accordingly, a congiarium of 75 denarii per head was bestowed upon the citizens, while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person. This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans.|$|R
