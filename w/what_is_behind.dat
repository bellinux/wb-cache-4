25|$|Angel's {{searching for}} a kidnapped child, only to stumble upon a force of unspeakable evil and unimaginable power, seeking him for some reason. Angel ends up {{fighting}} a walking volcano, and must try and survive long enough to discover who or <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> the recent strange series of events. Finally, the strange evil reveals itself; Perfect Zheng, a vampire who beat Angel up in the 1920s. Angel, Wesley, Cordelia, and Gunn try to put the pieces together in time {{to make sense of}} present events, a possible product of Angel's past encounter with Zheng. In fact, as it turns out, the gypsy curse that was used on Angel was meant to be used on Zheng, turning him into the 'vampire champion', but it didn't take, and Zheng is determined to find out why Angel's soul was restored and his wasn't. A battle for survival between the pair ensues, which Angel wins. Supposed to be set early in the second season of Angel. Collected in Angel: Long Night's Journey.|$|E
25|$|Before each mission {{the player}} {{is taken to}} an upgrade screen, where they can spend their honor in three sections: Techniques (passive {{upgrades}} and skills such as new one-hit executions), Distraction Items (such as smoke bombs and firecrackers) and Attack Items (such as caltrops and poison-tipped darts). The next screen allows the player to select any unlocked costumes and equip items. Each costume (except the starting one) gives special bonuses, but also a side effect in order to balance its power, and must be unlocked by completing a number of seals {{in the form of}} optional goals related to the specialty of that costume (for instance, optionally terrorizing enemies in specific ways to unlock a costume which improves the ability to terrorize). Completing the game once unlocks a New Game Plus mode where the enemies behave more intelligently and can kill the player with only a single bullet or hand-to-hand strike, the player's line of sight is limited to a cone aimed in whatever direction the player is facing (preventing players from seeing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind,</b> above, or below them unless they turn to look), the player is unable to see the enemy's line of sight and must intuit it from the direction an enemy's face is pointed, and the player can no longer detect the radius at which their actions will be heard by enemies.|$|E

Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> it, I don't know. But I'm inclined to think that I do not believe it is anything which the old concept of God really covers." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, the anti-German {{sentiment}} in Britain {{during the war}} is repeatedly referenced. General Melchett orders Blackadder to find out <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> the leak in top-secret battle plans and immediately, though erroneously, pins it on a [...] "German spy" [...] (who is later discovered to be inadvertently one of their own). Blackadder takes the chance to [...] "interrogate" [...] Captain Darling, who vehemently denies being a spy and {{says that he is}} [...] "as British as Queen Victoria", to which Blackadder sarcastically replies [...] "So your father is German, you're half German and you married a German?". Blackadder's retort references the fact that Victoria {{was a member of the}} House of Hanover and that her husband was a prince from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1917, Victoria's grandson King George V changed the royal house name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in an effort to appease British nationalist feelings.|$|E
500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and he loves the villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main {{goal is to make}} Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and has no interest in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E
500|$|Following Ajay's escape, he is left {{stranded}} in the snow at high altitude where he is rescued by Pagan Min. After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as {{he is unable to}} return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called [...] "The Relic". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> the expedition and the Relic.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{advertisement}} {{stated that}} Zuckerman had [...] "declared {{to the public}} that he is a homosexual" [...] in an article for Point South, and that the local community and radio station had been [...] "speculating" [...] that Zuckerman's sexual orientation may have motivated him [...] "to attack the scouts and the LDS Church" [...] because of the Scouts' ban on gay scout leaders and the Church's opposition to gay marriage. The advertisement stated that [...] "it would be very unfair for anyone to conclude that is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> Zuckermanâ€™s motives"; an analysis by Glenn Greenwald in Salon asserted that [...] "the ad absurdly sought to repudiate the very 'speculation' about Zuckerman which it had just amplified." [...] A second advertisement suggested that Zuckerman, as a [...] "gay rights advocate" [...] and [...] "homosexual reporter," [...] had [...] "a personal ax to grind" [...] because of the Scouts' ban on gay scout leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Jonah {{taught in}} the name of Rabbi Levi that the world was created with a letter bet (the first letter in [...] which begins , bereishit bara Elohim, [...] "In the {{beginning}} God created"), because just as the letter bet is closed at the sides but open in front, so one is not permitted to investigate what is above and what is below, what is before and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind.</b> Similarly, Bar Kappara reinterpreted the words of [...] to say, [...] "ask not of the days past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth," [...] teaching that one may speculate from the day that days were created, but one should not speculate on what was before that. And one may investigate from one end of heaven to the other, but one should not investigate what was before this world. Both Rabbi Johanan and Rabbi Eleazar (or other say Resh Lakish) compared this to a human king who instructed his servants to build a great palace on a dunghill. They built it for him. Thereafter, the king did not wish to hear mention of the dunghill.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1999[...] Similarly, the Mishnah taught that one should not teach about the Creation to more than one student..|$|E
2500|$|Adorno {{argues that}} Marx {{explained}} convincingly why the appearance-form {{and the real}} nature of human relations often does not directly coincide, not {{on the strength of}} a metaphysical philosophy such as transcendental realism, but by inferring the social meaning of human relations from the way they observably appear in practical life â€“ using systematic critical and logical thought as a tool of discovery. Every step in the analysis can be logically and empirically tested. The hermeneutic assumption is that these relations require shared meanings {{in order to be able}} to function and communicate at all. These shared presuppositions have an intrinsic rationality, because human behaviour â€“ ultimately driven by the need to survive â€“ is to a large extent purposive (teleological), and not arbitrary or random (though some of it may be). If the [...] "essential relationships" [...] never became visible or manifest in any way, no science would be possible at all, only speculative metaphysics. It is merely that sense data require correct interpretation â€“ they do not have a meaning independently of their socially mediated interpretation. In that sense, the mask presupposes the existence of something which for the time being remains invisible, but which can be revealed when one discovers <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> the mask. It may be that the essence suddenly reveals itself on the stage of history, or more simply that the understandings which one already has, are altered so that the essence of the thing is finally grasped.|$|E
5000|$|Why {{does the}} story of {{creation}} begin with bet?...

And one may investigate from one end of heaven to the other, but one should not investigate what was before this world. Similarly, the Rabbis in a Baraita interpreted [...] to forbid inquiry into the work of creation in the presence of two people, reading the words [...] "for ask now of the days past" [...] to indicate that one may inquire, but not two. The Rabbis reasoned that the words [...] "since the day that God created man upon the earth" [...] in [...] taught that one must not inquire concerning the time before creation. The Rabbis reasoned that the words [...] "the days past that were before you" [...] in [...] taught that one may inquire about the six days of creation. The Rabbis further reasoned that the words [...] "from the one end of heaven to the other" [...] in [...] taught that one must not inquire about what is beyond the universe, what is above and what is below, what is before and what is after.|$|E
