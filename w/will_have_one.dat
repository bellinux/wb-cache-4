Loss of a single chromosome (2n-1), in which the daughter cell(s) with the defect <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> chromosome missing from one of its pairs, is referred to as a monosomy. Gaining a single chromosome, in which the daughter cell(s) with the defect <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> chromosome in addition to its pairs is referred to as a trisomy. In the event that an aneuploidic gamete is fertilized, a number of syndromes might result.|$|E
