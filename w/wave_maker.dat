It comprises a 25 m diameter circular tank, with 168 active-absorbing <b>wave</b> <b>makers</b> around the circumference, and 28 pumps arranged beneath the raisable floor. These allow the creation of multi-directional random waves with current in any direction across the 15 m diameter, 2 m deep test area.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the new active absorption wave basin, named Hydrodynamic Calibrator (HC), constructed at the University of São Paulo (USP), in the Laboratory facilities of the Numerical Offshore Tank (TPN). The square (14 m 14 m) tank {{is able to}} generate and absorb waves from 0. 5 Hz to 2. 0 Hz, by means of 148 active hinged flap <b>wave</b> <b>makers.</b> An independent mechanical system drives each flap {{by means of a}} 1 HP servo-motor and a ball-screw based transmission system. A customized ultrasonic wave probe is installed in each flap, and is responsible for measuring wave elevation in the flap. A complex automation architecture was implemented, with three Programmable Logic Computers (PLCs), and a low-level software is responsible for all the interlocks and maintenance functions of the tank. Furthermore, all the control algorithms for the generation and absorption are implemented using higher level software (MATLAB /Simulink block diagrams). These algorithms calculate the motions of the <b>wave</b> <b>makers</b> both to generate and absorb the required wave field by taking into account the layout of the flaps and the limits of wave generation. The experimental transfer function that relates the flap amplitude to the wave elevation amplitude is used for the calculation of the motion of each flap. This paper describes the main features of the tank, followed by a detailed presentation of the whole automation system. It includes the measuring devices, signal conditioning, PLC and network architecture, real-time and synchronizing software and motor control loop. Finally, a validation of the whole automation system is presented, by means of the experimental analysis of the transfer function of the waves generated and the calculation of all the delays introduced by the automation system.

50|$|During World War II, the {{entirety}} of the work going on in the tanks was for the war effort. The size of his team grew to 63, and Davidson hired women to help build the models. The tank was being used for almost 16 hours a day, everyday. Since Davidson wanted his own tank instead of having to go to Columbia on the weekends to run tests, he submitted a proposal for another tank. In 1942 the plan was approved and construction began on Tank 2. Tank 2 was a 75-foot square with a depth of 4.5 feet. Once the tank opened it was the world's first indoor maneuvering basin. This meant that Davidson did not have to go to Columbia to run tests on the turning abilities of boats. Like Tank 1, Tank 2 had state of the art sensors and measuring equipment. In November 1942, Davidson started to run test on seaplane hulls for the Bureau of Aeronautics. The problem was that neither of the two existing tanks were suitable for the tests needed, so a proposal for another tank was submitted. Tank 3 opened in November 1944. This tank was designed for high speed towing. Tank 3 had a length of 313 feet, was 12 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. This tank was able to tow models at speeds of up to 60 ft/sec. A <b>wave</b> <b>maker</b> was also installed to make waves of up to 8 inches tall. Once the tank opened it was flooded with tests on seaplane hulls.

50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s {{some more}} {{extensions}} were necessary. The great demand for specialist research required {{the building of}} more sophisticated test facilities. The first one was the Seakeeping Basin (1956) for research into ship behaviour in waves. Next came the Shallow Water Basin (1958), for tug boats, inland shipping and merchandise shipping in shallow water. In 1965 a High Speed Basin and a Wave and Current Basin were put in operation.In the High Speed Basin tests are carried out with ship models or appendages that are propelled at very high speeds. In the Wave and Current Basin (today’s Offshore Basin) wind, current and waves are simulated for research into the behaviour of structures during complex operations at sea, such as {{the oil and gas}} production and dredging operations.In 1970 the Manoeuvring Simulator was built to find solutions for ever more complex manoeuvring operations and because of increased interest in the relation between man and ship.In 1972 the institute was further extended with a Vacuum Tank at Ede for the research into problems caused by propeller cavitation.

The latest extension was the Vessel Traffic Service simulator, where VTS operators are trained. In 2000 and 2001 the institute was again thoroughly updated.

Regularized Boussinesq System In this report, we study the regularized Boussinesq system t + ux + (u) x 16 xxt = 0; ut + x + uux 16 uxxt = 0; (1) which describes approximately the two-dimensional propagation of surface waves in a uni-form horizontal channel of length L lled with an irrotational, incompressible, invisid uid which in its undisturbed state has depth h. The non-dimensional variables (x; t) and u(x; t) represent, respectively, the deviation of the water surface from its undisturbed position and the horizontal velocity at water level q 2 3 h. Among a class of formally equivalent models, system (1) is particular interesting because that the dispersion relation is stabilizing for all wave numbers and it is reasonably straightforward to implement the initial-boundary-value problems that arise in laboratory experiments. Moreover, the regularized Boussinesq system is much simpler than the full Euler equations {{and can be used}} on a wider class of problems than a model equation with the assumption of waves traveling in only one direction.

The added resistance experiments include calm water, head wave, and oblique wave cases {{with a focus}} on establishing a validation benchmark for CFD codes computing the added resistance and motions of the ship model during maneuvering. The ship used is a 1 / 85. 19 scale KRISO Container Ship, KCS, model with a length of 2. 70 m. Tests were performed at the IIHR wave basin. The 20 x 40 x 4. 5 m wave basin is equipped with 6 inline plunger type <b>wave</b> <b>makers</b> and a 3 degrees of freedom carriage. A 4 degrees of freedom, surge, heave, roll, and pitch free mount with a mass spring damper system was used to tow the model. Calm water tests were performed for 13 Froude numbers between 0. 0867 and 0. 2817. The resistance coefficients, sinkage, and trim were found for each test. The calm water results were obtained and compared to results from towing tank facilities, with traditional mounts, to estimate facility biases at the IIHR wave basin. The results show that the size difference of the IIHR model and surge free motion create magnitude differences between facilities. Head and oblique wave tests were performed at Froude number 0. 26 and wave height to wavelength ratio, H/λ, of 0. 0167. For all wave tests, time histories of wave amplitude, resistance, and 4 DOF were measured. Fourier analysis was completed for all time histories of waves, forces, and motions and the 0 th, 1 st, and 2 nd harmonic amplitudes and phases are presented. All head wave results are compared to other facilities data taken in a towing tank with a traditional mount. The data from all wave heading data was analyzed {{with a focus on}} the trends with incremented wave encounter angle. Most harmonic amplitudes show good agreement between all facilities, but removal of the small model used by IIHR shows even better agreement between facilities. The oblique wave heading data shows good agreement with the only other experimental oblique wave added resistance testing. Complete uncertainty analysis was completed for select cases for calm water, head wave, and oblique wave conditions. The uncertainty showed accurate data form most wavelength settings...|$|R
40|$|Artificial Surf Reefs (ASR) {{are built}} {{to improve the}} surf {{conditions}} of the waves. Three ASR have been realized {{over the last decade}} and many more are planned to be constructed within a period of ten years. Even though a hot topic, ASR design is often done fairly ad hoc and there remains great uncertainty as to what the optimal dimensions of the ASR should be. Through combination of numerical and experimental modeling efforts, this study aims at: 1) Improving our general understanding of how ASR design affects the actual surfability; 2) Designing an optimal reef shape; 3) Obtaining measurements of the surfability parameters to verify the predicted surfability by the numerical wave model. The quality of a surf break is expressed in four measurable parameters: breaker height, breaker shape, peel angle and the attendant currents. Usually a surf break differs from other places along the coast by the ability to make waves peel along their crest. Therefore the peel angle is studied thoroughly. By considering idealized topographies, the important reef properties that affect the peel angle become clear. The model applied in the numerical study is a state-of-the-art, deterministic amplitude evolution model that takes into account quadratic interactions (triad interactions). Optimal shape dimensions were estimated in the numerical study for varying reef shapes and wave conditions. The resulting ASR design was constructed in a wave basin in the laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Faculty of Civil Engineering. Unidirectional incident waves (regular and bichromatic) were generated by three piston type <b>wave</b> <b>makers</b> with second-order <b>wave</b> board control. The laboratory observations were used to verify three parameters that were predicted with the numerical study: breaker height, breaker shape and the peel angle. The combined numerical and experimental study shows that: Two reef properties are needed to obtain surfable peel angles. First there must be a certain angle enclosed between the reef normal and the offshore wave direction. Secondly, the depth at which the reef starts needs to be sufficiently shallow. The reef shape performs optimal when the tip of the reef is relatively sharp. This results in less intense breakers suitable for the take-off. The predicted surfability parameters by the numerical wave model agreed well with the laboratory measurements. The experiment showed that the water depth over the reef crest significantly affects the breaker shape. Also the currents over and around the reef {{have a significant impact on}} the surfability of the surf break. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|First Wave {{describes}} the post WWII proliferation of low quality coffee [...] . second wave is exemplified by companies [...] . mass producing higher quality espresso coffee for cafes and supermarkets. Third <b>wave</b> coffee <b>makers</b> are distinguished by their dedication to extracting {{the best from}} coffee in its purest, unadulterated form (Ross 2009). An article in the Melbourne Age on 13 October 2009 left me feeling both annoyed and intrigued. The wave analogy implies Australia’s coffee culture did not start until after World War II and that post-war migrants from Southern Italy brought the coffee drinking habit to Australia. The ‘coffee snobbery’ inherent in the article, and the subtle suggestion that third wave coffee is accessible only to distinguished coffee drinkers, is also intriguing. This paper dismisses the wave analogy {{as a way of}} explaining the development of a coffee culture in Australia and, instead, explores the relationship that Australians have had with coffee since the 1930 s. It challenges the collective belief that post-war migrants from Southern Italy transported their coffee culture to Australia and asks the question; is an appreciation of taste and flavour a cultural asset belonging to an elite coffee drinking group or has it become important because coffee has lost its connection to sophistication and become a mainstream beverage...|$|R
