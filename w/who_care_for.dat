5|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of people with chronic pain notice memory and attention difficulties. Objective psychological testing has found problems with memory, attention, verbal ability, mental flexibility and thinking speed. Pain is also associated with increased depression, anxiety, fear, and anger. Persistent pain reduces function and overall quality of life, and is demoralizing and debilitating for the person experiencing pain and for those <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|E
25|$|Eusocial {{behavior}} {{has been discovered}} in the genus Synalpheus. The species Synalpheus regalis lives inside sponges in colonies that can number over 300 members. All of them are the offspring of a single large female, the queen, and possibly a single male. The offspring are divided into workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the young and predominantly male soldiers who protect the colony with their huge claws.|$|E

25|$|We {{need to make}} a {{balanced}} decision about compassionate use. If I were Charlotte Figi's parents and lived in Colorado I would have done exactly what they did. And as a doctor, I would gladly prescribe marijuana products for many of my patients who failed existing therapies if it were legal in my state.... Until we have the scientific data, we should make medical marijuana available to physicians <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> people with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their patients.|$|E
25|$|People <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> those {{infected}} with Ebola should wear protective clothing including masks, gloves, gowns and goggles. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) {{recommend that the}} protective gear leaves no skin exposed. These measures are also recommended for those who may handle objects contaminated by an infected person's body fluids. In 2014, the CDC began recommending that medical personnel receive training on the proper suit-up and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE); in addition, a designated person, appropriately trained in biosafety, should be watching each step of these procedures to ensure they are done correctly. In Sierra Leone, the typical training period {{for the use of}} such safety equipment lasts approximately 12 days.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a tribute}} to our forebears and {{in keeping with the}} work ethic {{embedded}} from our agricultural heritage, this Museum has won acclaim from visitors all over the United States, and most foreign countries. They say: “This is the best little historical museum we have ever seen!” Thanks to the handful of devoted folks <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> all the historical collections and items which tell the story of people of this area. The “homey” atmosphere, and the way the collections are displayed make you feel like you have stepped back a hundred years and will {{give you a sense of}} what it was like to live in pioneer days. There is something here for everyone, of all ages, to see, learn about, and enjoy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 Travers {{returned}} to playwriting {{with a new}} farce, Corker's End, which was produced at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. The Times commented, [...] "Some of his jokes, which always tended to be outrageous, are perhaps a little more outspoken {{than they used to}} be, but nothing essential has changed. Those <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> farce will enjoy themselves for exactly that reason." [...] In 1970 BBC television broadcast seven Travers plays: Rookery Nook, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Turkey Time, A Cup of Kindness, Plunder, Dirty Work and She Follows Me About. At the age of 83 Travers rewrote the plays for the BBC to concentrate on plot twists and verbal misunderstandings, rather than the high-speed action and split-second timing that characterised the original stage versions.|$|E
