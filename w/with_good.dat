5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends <b>with</b> <b>good</b> prevailing over evil.|$|E

5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site <b>with</b> <b>good</b> drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted <b>with</b> <b>good</b> reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E

5|$|Collected by French {{botanist}} Jacques Labillardière in 1792–93, Telopea truncata {{was first}} scientifically described in 1805. Genetic {{analysis revealed that}} the Tasmanian waratah is the most distinctive of the five waratah species. It can be cultivated in temperate climates, requiring soils <b>with</b> <b>good</b> drainage and ample moisture in part-shaded or sunny positions. Several commercially available cultivars that are hybrids of T.truncata with the New South Wales waratah (T.speciosissima) and Gippsland waratah (T.oreades) have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered <b>with</b> <b>good</b> quality stucco flooring. At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor. The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic.|$|E

5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as it is very hard to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils <b>with</b> <b>good</b> drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} {{activities at the}} airport gradually increased. In the early 1960s, sailplanes became popular at the airport.

Ronald Stensrud established a pilot school in 1966, but was forced to close after failing to make ends meet.|$|E
