2500|$|When Troughton {{left the}} series in 1969, the Doctor was renewed again, {{but this time}} the change was forced on him by the Time Lords at the {{conclusion}} of The War Games, where it is referred to as a [...] "change of appearance". As with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although Jon Pertwee's portrayal of the Third Doctor also differed quite substantially from Troughton's. Unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in The War Games the Doctor protests, [...] "You can't just change <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> like without consulting me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 12 September 1859 the Radical MP Richard Cobden visited Gladstone, who {{recorded}} {{it in his}} diary: [...] "... further conv. with Mr. Cobden on Tariffs & relations with France. We are closely & warmly agreed". Cobden was sent as Britain's representative to the negotiations with France's Michel Chevalier for a free trade treaty between the two countries. Gladstone wrote to Cobden: [...] "... the great aim—the moral and political significance of the act, and its probable and desired fruit in binding the two countries together by interest and affection. [...] Neither you nor I attach for the moment any superlative value to this Treaty {{for the sake of}} the extension of British trade. ... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> to is the social good, the benefit to the relations of the two countries, and the effect on the peace of Europe".|$|E

I don't suppose I betrayed my dire confusion, for Edna went off unconcernedly without another glance at me.|$|R

2500|$|Jermaine Lamarr Cole {{was born}} on January 28, 1985, at an American {{military}} base in Frankfurt, West Germany. His father is an African American former soldier for the U.S. Army, and his mother is a white German {{who worked as a}} postal worker for the United States Postal Service. Cole's father later abandoned the family during his youth, prompting his mother to relocate Cole and his brother, Zach Cole to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Cole grew up in a multi-ethnic environment, and when asked about how closely his ethnicity impacts him, Cole commented, [...] "I can identify with white people, because I know my mother, her side of the family, who I love. But {{at the end of the}} day, [...] never felt white. I can identify [...] but never have I felt like I'm one of them. I identify more with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> like, because that's how I got treated [...] not necessarily in a negative way". During his youth, Cole expressed an affinity for basketball and music, and served as a first-chair violinist for the Terry Sanford Orchestra until 2003.|$|E

60|$|As soon as I {{was well}} enough to go abroad, I went with the maid to see the house, {{and to see the}} {{apartment}} I was to have; and everything was so handsome and so clean and well, that, in short, I had nothing to say, but was wonderfully pleased and satisfied with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had met with, which, considering the melancholy circumstances I was in, was far beyond <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> for.|$|R

5000|$|Landecker {{earned her}} Screen Actors Guild card doing a voiceover for a Tampax {{commercial}}. In the commercial Landecker echoes {{the voice of}} the on-camera actress, saying only the word [...] "ballet", but made $10,000 in residuals from the commercial. Landecker recalls, [...] "I never saw money like that in my life, and it didn't even matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> like! <b>I</b> was hooked on voiceover from then on!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Reist," [...] he said slowly, [...] "your {{sister is}} very charming, and I {{have a great}} admiration for her. Yet I must admit this. The idea which you have {{suggested}} is an altogether new one to me. I did not, for one moment, imagine that she or you or any one would attach any significance to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> upon {{at the time as}} a harmless little ceremony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Quite the contrary. At least--I {{mean that}} you are wrong. I am the most commonplace person you can imagine--if you only knew. No matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> may <b>look,</b> <b>I</b> mean." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} his {{technique}} as an artist, Hyde says: [...] Minimalism is where I really came from, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought about; but I was less interested in the grid {{as a type of}} compositional device than as serialization and repetition. The grid was just a means for placing those fresco panels and repeating {{them in a way that}} doesn't involve notions of space, which I've never been interested in. Repetition allowed a sequential logic—a music of visual information.|$|R

5000|$|The {{cover for}} the album was photographed by Tim Barber. In an {{interview}} for his official website, Healy claimed that [...] "I wanted a portrait of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> like at that very second. I wanted to show that I {{was no longer the}} little boy that appeared on the inside sleeve of The Man Who. I did think about other images, but they just didn't feel right.

[...] "There are inconveniences {{attending}} such feelings as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.

"Oh, I {{know that}} you are very obstinate," [...] she said softly, [...] "very obstinate and very devoted to your marvellous country, but you have a soul, Leopold; you know that there are human duties as great as any your country ever imposed upon you.

6000|$|... "Yes, to be sure," [...] said Wemmick. [...] "Of course, {{there can}} be no {{objection}} to your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself {{to get him out of}} it. But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at is this. The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved. That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't you see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't suppose," [...] {{said the}} old man, in a high, husky treble, [...] "but what I could get some of it back from the captain; may be all. He didn't seem any ways graspin'. I don't want Lyddy should feel, {{any more than you}} do, Maria, that we're glad to have her go.

6000|$|... "Look here, old man," [...] Ralph said, [...] "I am not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>look.</b> I am a French officer, and I want to {{get down}} near the Prussian outposts, but without passes I could not get on. Besides I have been wounded, and am too weak to walk far.

6000|$|... "I suppose I {{should be}} now languishing in Bideford jail, shouldn't I?

60|$|I {{glanced at}} him, {{for he was}} silent, and in my life I can recall no sadder moment than this. The General heard, but {{the man who had}} spoken these words was gone forever.

He heard, but he did not respond; for the spirit was gone. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> upon was the {{tortured}} body from which the genius--the spirit I had worshipped--had fled. I turned away, only to turn back in anger.|$|R
5000|$|Students’ Radio [...] "Żak" [...] and its Charts {{were the}} first to give Marek Niedźwiecki some popularity. He recalls the times with sentiment: [...] "I like those {{beginnings}} of mine. I don’t distance myself from them. Now in the programme [...] "Markomania" [...] I do a small window - Radio Luxemburg Charts from 40 years before - so I play those things that I used to play in [...] "Żak". It's really nice for me, because I read the charts and in my mind I am watching a film from the past: <b>I</b> recall <b>what</b> <b>I</b> played then, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> like, <b>what</b> new songs appeared, which ones disappeared." ...|$|R
