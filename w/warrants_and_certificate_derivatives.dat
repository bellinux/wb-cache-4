6000|$|Here {{it will be}} as well {{to pause}} a moment and avert one {{possible}} misunderstanding. I do not mean that you and I cannot and do not practically see and personally remark on this or that eccentric or intermediate type, for which the word [...] "feeble-minded" [...] might be a very convenient word, and might correspond to a genuine though indefinable fact of experience. In {{the same way we}} might speak, and do speak, of such and such a person being [...] "mad with vanity" [...] without wanting two keepers to walk in and take the person off. But I ask the reader to remember always that I am talking of words, not as they are used in talk or novels, but as they will be used, and have been used, in <b>warrants</b> <b>and</b> <b>certificates,</b> <b>and</b> Acts of Parliament. The distinction between the two is perfectly clear and practical. The difference is that a novelist or a talker can be trusted to try and hit the mark; it is all to his glory that the cap should fit, that the type should be recognised; that he should, in a literary sense, hang the right man. But {{it is by no means}} always to the interests of governments or officials to hang the right man. The fact that they often do stretch words in order to cover cases is the whole foundation of having any fixed laws or free institutions at all. My point is not that I have never met anyone whom I should call feeble-minded, rather than mad or imbecile. My point is that if I want to dispossess a nephew, oust a rival, silence a blackmailer, or get rid of an importunate widow, there is nothing in logic to prevent my calling them feeble-minded too. And the vaguer the charge is the less they will be able to disprove it.|$|R
50|$|Growing dissatisfaction {{within the}} members of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Upper Canada with the slow {{responses}} of the Grand Lodge of England in forwarding <b>warrants,</b> <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> the like led {{to the question of whether}} it was time to create an independent grand lodge in Canada. After a Provincial Grand Lodge meeting in which the idea was ruled out of order by the Deputy Grand Master, the officers met and formed the Grand Lodge of Canada on 10 November 1855. Its officers were elected the next day, with W. Bro. William Mercer Wilson being elected the first Grand Master of the newly created Grand Lodge, and installed on 2 December.|$|R
