40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, consumption of <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> has been increasing, concurrent with a rise in consumer interest in free-range and 'healthy-eating' foodstuffs. Game birds can carry zoonotic pathogens, predominantly within the viscera. Whilst removal of the viscera is normal practice during the dressing of game birds, there is a specialised market in the UK for certain small game birds that are consumed uneviscerated. This qualitative risk assessment evaluates the risks to the consumer from the production and consumption of both uneviscerated and eviscerated small game birds for Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli (verotoxigenic), E. coli (antimicrobial resistant), Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Chlamydophila psittaci and Listeria monocytogenes. Whilst most pathogen/bird combinations were considered to have a very low risk, results suggest that Campylobacter spp. and T. gondii can pose an increased risk to consumers for some species of <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds.</b> There was no greater risk associated with the consumption of uneviscerated game birds than for eviscerated birds. In some cases, the risk from eviscerated birds may even be slightly higher, as the risk of cross-contamination during evisceration can outweigh the reduction in pathogenic organisms due to removal of the viscera. Additionally, the current low frequency of consumption of uneviscerated game birds of most species reduced the overall risk estimate for these birds. If there is an increased frequency of consumption in the future, then this risk should be re-examined. Assuming a general level of compliance with regulations and basic hygiene practices, the results suggested that large outbreaks of infection among UK consumers are unlikely, but sporadic, infectious events could occur due to combinations of 'rare-event, hygiene-related issues' in the 'field-to-fork' chain and/or inadequate cooking of the bird...|$|E

40|$|Severe declines have {{occurred}} in the populations of <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> in Britain. This has been attributed to agricultural intensification, leading to the loss of invertebrates vital within chick diets, fewer feeding resources for adults, and inadequate provision of nesting and brood-rearing habitat. This paper explores the potential value of simple sown grass strips – beetle banks – in providing these resources, and compares results with functionally similar conventional field margins. The data indicate that beetle banks can contribute useful, albeit lower, densities of chick-food than conventional margins. These resources are more abundant later in the season, which may have implications for early hatched chicks. Beetle banks provide considerable quantities of nesting cover for adults, although sheltering conditions may never be as satisfactory as in well managed hedgerows. Given the ease and low cost of establishment of beetle banks, we suggest that they may be valuable components within a range of game management techniques on the farm, as a ‘spin-off ’ to their primary role as overwintering habitat for polyphagous predators. They may be important particularly where resources for game birds are impoverished, but clearly cannot substitute for suitably managed field margins...|$|E
40|$|One {{thousand}} {{three hundred}} and eighty three (1383) samples of food, feed, water and compost samples yielded 60 Aeromonas isolates through enrichment technique. Ampicillin dextrose agar and Aeromonas 'Ryan' medium were used successfully without Ampicillin. The isolates were identified to the species level using the Aerokey-II. This speciation yielded twelve A. hydrophila, sixteen A. veronii bv. sobria, twenty-six A. caviae, three A. trota, two A. schubertii and one A. jandaei strain. Out of the sixty strains isolated, five were sensitive to 10 ug ampicillin, which included four A. caviae and one A. trota.

40|$|Restocking from captive-reared red-legged {{partridges}} (Alectoris rufa) is {{a frequent}} practice in some Spanish regions, due to the strong decrease of wild populations size in the last years. Chukar partridges (A. chukar), which never lived as <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> in Spain, are more prolific and efficient meat producers, being legally bred in many Spanish farms to be directly sent to slaughterhouses. Releasing foreign partridges species or hybrids is strictly forbidden by hunting and environment preservation laws. However, eventual hybridization with chukar partridges in breeding farms is a worrying possibility as, in many cases, farms produce birds for both meat and restocking purposes. DNA analyses might be useful to elucidate the genetic purity of wild or farmed partridges. Single Strand Conformation Polymorphisms (SSCP´s) were studied on individual DNA samples from Spanish supposed red-legged and captive chukar partridges. Two mitochondrial (Cytochrome B and D-loop) and one nuclear (Ribosomal DNA-intervening transcribed spacer, ITS) regions were considered for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) design and further polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results suggest that these techniques might identify interspecific A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids among wild and captive supposed red-legged partridges by detecting chukar partridge ancestors in their genealogies.

40|$|There {{are many}} unique aspects and peculiarities {{regarding}} {{the transmission of}} foodborne pathogens at the wildlife–livestock–human interface in Europe, which include the diversity of farming systems, wildlife and habitats, {{as well as the}} consumption habits of the European human population. However, it can be generalized that zoonotic diseases acquired from wildlife (or directly related to wildlife) are mainly linked to the consumption of undercooked venison, hunting or handling infected game carcasses. Hunting has always been {{an integral part of the}} cultures and traditions of European rural societies, with an estimated greater than seven million hunters practicing this activity for recreational, social, and/or consumptive purposes (Brainerd, [URL] 2007). Recently, there has been a growing consumer demand for hunted meat and cured, fermented, and dried game products, which have become more popular and accessible in the European market (Cenci-Goga et al., Meat Sci 90 : 599 – 606, 2012; Obwegeser et al., Vet Micro 159 : 149 – 154, 2012). Schulp et al. (Ecol Econ 105 : 292 – 305, 2014) report that 38 of the 97 European game species, including birds and mammals, are consumed, with the red deer (Cervus elaphus), the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), the European hare (Lepus europaeus), the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), and the wild boar (Sus scrofa) being the main game food species, since they are hunted in all countries and have the largest harvest numbers.

40|$|International audienceSince the 1970 s, {{the decline}} of the occidental populations of European Quail Coturnix c. coturnix, a partial migrant Galliform species, has driven the release of {{domestic}} Japanese Quail Coturnix c. japonica into the <b>wild</b> as <b>game</b> <b>birds.</b> Recent experiments suggest that reproductive isolating mechanisms have not developed to prevent hybridization between European and Japanese Quail. To assess the potential impact of hybridization between the subspecies in the wild, this study aims to compare the migratory characteristics of captive European Quail, domestic Japanese Quail, F 1 hybrids and a backcross. In a laboratory experiment, birds hatched in summer and reared under a natural photoperiod were transferred during winter to an artificial photoperiod (light–dark) of 14 : 10 h. Behavioural (migratory restlessness, crowing activity in males) and physiological (sexual development, fat accumulation, body mass) measures were recorded. Domestic Japanese Quail showed no migratory tendency in response to the increased day length. F 1 hybrids showed rapid sexual development and few of them exhibited the typical profile of a migrant bird. Backcrosses showed great variation in their response, comparable with those of the European Quail. Therefore, hybridization could lead to an increased proportion of quail showing sedentary rather than migratory behaviour. Furthermore, hybrids that do show migratory behaviour have the potential to facilitate Japanese gene flow into areas where the release of domestic Quail as <b>game</b> <b>birds</b> is not yet practised...|$|R

The above definition for trials in Great Britain, for example, is quite different from, for example, FDSB (Field Dog Stud Book) field trials for pointers, English setters, German shorthaired pointers and Brittanys in the United States. The FDSB is the oldest stud book in the USA. The American Field publishes a weekly newspaper announcing field trials (open and amateur) in the USA, Canada and Japan and reporting the results of previous trials. Stakes in field trials are for puppies, derbies and mature dogs for which there are generally three placements in each stake. There are championships for which dogs must qualify by winning placements in order to compete in them. They generally award a winner and runner-up winner but there are exceptions to this. i.e. The National Championship has only a winner.

40|$|Background: Indigenous peoples have {{traditionally}} relied on foods hunted and gathered from their immediate environment. The Eastern James Bay Cree people consume <b>wild</b> <b>game</b> and <b>birds,</b> {{and these are}} believed to provide health as well as cultural benefits. Objective: To determine the fatty acid (FA) composition of traditional <b>game</b> and <b>bird</b> meats hunted in the Eastern James Bay area. Design: Harvested traditional <b>game</b> and <b>birds</b> were analysed for FA composition. A total of 52 samples from six wildlife species were collected {{in the areas of}} Chisasibi, Waswanipi and Mistissini, of which 35 were from birds (white partridge and Canada goose) and 17 were from land animals (beaver, moose, caribou and black bear). Results: Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was the most common n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in all samples except for the black bear flesh, in which it was docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn- 3). In white partridge, beaver and caribou flesh, PUFAs (mainly n- 6) were the most common category of fats while in goose, moose and black bear flesh, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) predominated. In all species, saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were the second most important FAs. It would appear that in the land animals and birds that were analysed, the SFA content was lower and the PUFA content was higher than store-bought meats giving them a more heart-healthy profile. Conclusions: These results showed that the FA composition of game species consumed by the James Bay Cree population is consistent with a beneficial diet and that traditional foods should continue to be promoted among the Cree people to provide better physical health as well as social and spiritual benefits...|$|R
