5|$|Events outside Britain have {{included}} The Clown Trial of President Bush held in New Haven in 2003 to {{protest against the}} Iraq War. Michael Dickinson has exhibited political and satirical collages in Turkey {{for which he was}} arrested, and charged, but acquitted of any crime—an outcome which <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have positive implications for Turkey's relationship with the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Head of the {{surveillance}} team I Nyoman Gatra later testified in court during trials for the accused that police were initially unaware Sukumaran {{was part of}} the group, because original information obtained from the AFP did not mention him by name. Indonesian police assumed Sukumaran was Chan's bodyguard as he <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> accompany Chan in Bali.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E

5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants and bank cormorants. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} two seasons with Chicago, Pierce posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen contributed to his {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in the sixth inning or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh's White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February, Finucane {{participated in}} the third Circus operation. 65 {{supported}} 610 and 302 Squadron over Saint-Omer. Leading high cover, Finucane claimed another Bf 109 over Cap d'Alprech as three German fighters attempted to attack the other squadrons from behind. It <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> crash into woodland. On 26 February 1941, 65 Squadron was posted to Kirton in Lindsey. The airfield was located in Lincolnshire in No. 12 Group RAF's sector where air-to-air combat was very uncommon in daylight. The stay at Lindsey was short. On 14 April 1941, Finucane was posted as a Flight Commander to the newly formed Australian No. 452 Squadron RAAF, the first RAAF squadron to serve in Fighter Command. He was promoted to acting flight lieutenant the same day.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of the 23 August an Fw 190 was claimed off Dunkirk and on 8/9 September 1943, an Fw 190A-5 off Aldborough proved his 19th victory and last claim of Cunningham for the year. The Fw 190 <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> crash into the sea by the Coastguard. Cunningham {{achieved}} his 20th and final air victory on {{the night of}} the 2/3 January 1944. He chased a Messerschmitt Me 410 to France, near Boulogne before shooting it down. The machine, Werknummer 017, Code U5+FE, belonging to 14./Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2), crashed at Marquise. Oberleutnant Helmut Schülze and Heinz Beger were killed.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E
5|$|Sam's initial {{function}} in the show was that of hospital Lothario – romancing and fathering a child with his boss, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), as well as engaging in relationships with Ward Sisters Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) and Faye Morton (Patsy Kensit), SHO Maddy Young (Nadine Lewington), and Staff Nurse Zoe Foxe (Alicia Davies). However, he was taken on a redemptive path and <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> change his philandering ways after being diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma stage three, with just a 40% survival rate.|$|E

5000|$|Avi {{attempts}} to get Jake {{to understand the nature}} of the ego. He tells Jake [...] "the greatest con that ego ever pulled was making you believe that he is you." [...] This <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the 'ultimate con', in that no-one wants to sever their connection with their ego, because they refuse to challenge their own lifelong investment in it. In the end, Jake also steps off the proverbial chess board by making a conscious effort to reverse everything his ego tells him <b>to</b> do. This <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the truest and most fundamental application of the Formula. The characters of Jake, Zach, Avi and Sorter (Mark Strong) <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> ultimately reject the ego's 'rules'. The character of Dorothy Macha <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> succumb to them.|$|R

5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Punk began feuding with Mike Knox after Knox's girlfriend, Kelly Kelly, <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have {{feelings}} for Punk. Punk defeated Knox {{in their first}} singles match (qualifying for the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember in the process) {{as well as the}} rematch, after which Kelly Kelly celebrated Punk's victory over her boyfriend. Punk then teamed with D-Generation X and the Hardy Boyz in their Survivor Series match against Rated-RKO, Knox, Johnny Nitro and Gregory Helms, a match in which all the participants on DX's side survived elimination. At December to Dismember, Punk participated in the Elimination Chamber for the ECW Championship; however, he was the first person eliminated by Rob Van Dam.|$|E
5|$|The Disney tag also <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> {{have turned}} off people who {{assumed that the}} film was for children. In addition, Rocketeers {{original}} Art Deco poster was changed because it failed {{to draw attention to}} the cast, including then-current James Bond, Timothy Dalton. A new poster was designed to feature Dalton, Billy Campbell and Jennifer Connelly prominently. The film also failed in Britain, grossing just over £1 million in its first two weeks at just under 250 screens. The new ad campaign was being designed while the British promotional campaign for the film was already under way and some theaters still had the stylized United States movie poster.|$|E

5|$|The black currawong consumes {{the berries}} of the heath species Leptecophylla juniperina, and Astroloma humifusum, {{and the native}} sedge Gahnia grandis, as well as {{domestic}} pea, and apples. Invertebrates consumed include earthworms (Lumbricidae) and many types of insects, such as ants, moths, flies, crickets, grasshoppers and beetles like weevils, scarabs and leaf beetles. It is adaptable, and has learnt to eat the introduced European wasp (Vespula germanica). A bird that was being harassed by three scarlet robins (Petroica boodang) <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> suddenly turn on them and catch and eat one. Other vertebrates recorded as prey include the house mouse (Mus musculus), small lizards, tadpoles, chickens, ducklings, the young of domestic turkey, Tasmanian nativehen (Gallinula mortierii), flame robin (Petroica phoenicea) and rabbit.|$|E
5|$|The censors thus {{expanded}} their jurisdiction from what <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> what was {{implied in the}} spectator's mind. In The Office Wife (1930), several of Joan Blondell's disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the implied image of the actress being naked just off-screen was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using their imaginations, so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, if allowed at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{classes were}} all pre-chosen by BR, but the various regions {{were free to}} choose, within certain parameters, which specific locomotives were to be represented. Tasked with supplying a suitable Coronation, the London Midland Region (LMR) selected No. 46236 City of Bradford. Regions were also free to choose their drivers. To drive the engine throughout, the LMR chose driver Byford from Camden shed who <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be sufficiently experienced. City of Bradford was then tested on its home ground between London Euston and Carlisle, on the Eastern Region (ER) between London Kings Cross and Leeds, on the Western Region (WR) between London Paddington and Plymouth, then finally on the Southern Region (SR) between London Waterloo and Exeter.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{synthesis}} of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms {{it came to be}} held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends.

5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
