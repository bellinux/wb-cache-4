There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E

During the interview Pusztai said he had [...] "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing." [...] When asked why he felt concerned, he said [...] "it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned" [...] and discussed his results in general terms.|$|E

500|$|Parker said {{following}} the tremendous success of [...] "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", {{much of the}} direct feedback he received for [...] "Damien" [...] was negative. Parker described it as the [...] "first sort of backlash" [...] he had experienced with South Park, with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had [...] "sold out". Parker said, [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?' We just kept doing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> was funny, we didn't go start making commercials or anything. But everybody was saying we sold out." [...] Nevertheless, the episode received generally positive reviews, and {{has been described as}} one of South Park [...] "classic episodes".|$|E
500|$|Despite his defeat, American Pharoah {{was moved}} up to Grade I class for the Del Mar Futurity over seven furlongs on September 3. He was ridden by Victor Espinoza {{for the first time}} and started as the 3.2–1 second {{favorite}} behind Best Pal Stakes winner Skyway, with Calculator and Iron Fist also in the field. American Pharoah took the lead from the start and went clear in the straight to win by four and three quarter lengths from Calculator, with a gap of more than eight lengths back to Iron Fist in third. Commenting on the colt's improvement, Baffert said, [...] "We took the blinkers off, put cotton in his ears and schooled him a lot. He trained well, we decided he was ready and we put him in there. Today, he behaved himself and showed what he could do. He did <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> he'd do the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let us know that it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> was just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E

Dean DeLeo stated that the band was also unhappy about the performance, stating [...] "We were all let down that that album didn’t do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it would do.

2500|$|Friedkin {{elaborated}} on {{this theme}} {{in an interview}} with Thomas D. Clagett: [...] In the director's opinion, the premise of The Wages of Fear (both the novel and the first film adaptation) seemed to him a metaphor for [...] "the world [...] full of strangers who hated one another, but if they didn't cooperate, if they didn't work together in some way, they would blow up." [...] Walon Green, the screenwriter, said that he and Friedkin [...] "wanted a cynical movie where fate turns the corner for the people before they turn it themselves". Additionally, their intention was to [...] "write a real movie about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> was the reality of Latin America and the presence of foreigners there today".|$|E

[...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E
