5|$|Amfleet is a {{fleet of}} single-level {{intercity}} railroad passenger cars built by the Budd Company for American company Amtrak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Budd based the Amfleet design on its earlier Metroliner electric multiple unit. An initial order for 57 cars in 1973 to supplement the Metroliners on the Northeast Corridor grew to two orders totaling 642 cars, sufficient to reequip all the services on the Northeast Corridor and many other routes around the United States. The first 492 cars, known as Amfleet I and completed between 1975–1977, <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> short-distance service. A second order of 150 cars, known as Amfleet II and completed between 1980–1983, <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> long-distance service. They were the last intercity passenger cars built by Budd.|$|E
5|$|Clausholm Castle (1693–94) near Randers was {{designed}} by the Danish architect Ernst Brandenburger with assistance of the Swede Nicodemus Tessin who was invited to decorate the facade. The more sophisticated first-floor apartments with their higher ceilings <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> use by royalty.|$|E
5|$|Excluding Whitney's sports fields, the school's outdoor {{facilities}} {{are composed of}} a number of circular gathering areas (including an amphitheatre) that <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> use during lunch hour and for outdoor class excursions. In addition, Whitney's class campus structures have private workspaces for the teaching faculty from which each of the structure's classrooms branch off.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes <b>were</b> <b>{{designed}}</b> <b>for</b> Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{repetitive}} dives. The US Navy tables <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> {{a single}} repetitive dive, {{and there were}} concerns {{about the safety of}} extending their use to multiple repetitive dives. As an attempt to address this issue, some tables were modified to reduce the allowable bottom time for repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17P-2 was {{identical}} to the P-1, with the additional installation of an ETC 500 bomb rack under the fuselage. These aircraft <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> night reconnaissance. It is assumed that Dornier converted most, if not all, P-2 models from existing P-1 production aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The M-class cruisers were a {{class of}} light cruisers planned, but never built, by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine before World War II. The ships <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> {{commerce}} raiding in the Atlantic Ocean. The design {{for the first four}} ships suffered from a number of problems, and so the fifth and sixth ships were substantially redesigned.|$|E
5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
5|$|Ironclads <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> several roles, {{including}} as {{high seas}} battleships, coastal defense ships, and long-range cruisers. The rapid development of warship {{design in the}} late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward {{by the development of}} heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.|$|E
50|$|Varminter bullets <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> varmint hunting. As such, {{they are}} {{normally}} smaller calibers, and <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> rapid expansion, {{and need to}} be accurate to hit the typically small targets.|$|R
50|$|The 420G is a 6-speed manual {{transmission}} manufactured by Getrag. It <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> longitudinal engine applications and <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> use on engines producing up to 499 Nm of torque.|$|R
5000|$|Infrared flash quality/range tradeoff: If the {{infrared}} flash <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> maximum range the images may be overly white, or blur. If {{the infrared}} flash <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> best image quality, range will be sacrificed.|$|R
5|$|ML's {{first two}} motor vessels, with engines and {{accommodation}} located aft, were commissioned in April 1956. The Manchester Vanguard and Venture, 1,662 grt, <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the Great Lakes service. Two larger motor vessels, the Manchester Faith and Fame, 4,460 grt, were commissioned in April 1959, and the Faith {{quickly became the}} first commercial vessel to transit the newly opened St Lawrence Seaway with its larger locks.|$|E
5|$|The sensors <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> air {{deployment}} {{by either}} of two means. The first was by parachute, which would hang the devices in trees, where {{they appeared to}} be part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which would drive the spike-shaped device into the ground like a lawn dart, burying all but their antennae, which were designed to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.|$|E
5|$|These bus power {{currents}} being {{much higher}} than cables <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for,</b> though not unsafe, cause a larger voltage between {{the ends of the}} ground signal, significantly reducing noise margins causing problems with High Speed signaling. Battery Charging Specification 1.1 specifies that charging devices must dynamically limit bus power current draw during High Speed signaling; 1.2 simply specifies that charging devices and ports must be designed to tolerate the higher ground voltage difference in High Speed signaling.|$|E
50|$|Advanced models <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> high {{mobility}} and security. Most {{of the advanced}} models <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> advanced processing and include a port replicator. Models from the T, S, E and P-series are in the advanced segment.|$|R
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{different}} types of shoes. Most types of shoes <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> specific activities. For example, boots <b>are</b> typically <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> work or heavy outdoor use. Athletic shoes <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> particular sports such as running, walking, or other sports. Some shoes <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to <b>be</b> worn at more formal occasions, and others <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> casual wear. There are also {{a wide variety}} of shoes <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> different types of dancing. Orthopedic shoes are special types of footwear <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> individuals with particular foot problems or special needs. Other animals, such as dogs and horses, may also wear special shoes to protect their feet as well.|$|R

5|$|Within {{a year of}} the enquiry, almost 100 cells {{had been}} {{enlarged}} by knocking down the inner wall between two cells, and a classification system was introduced. Internal walls were constructed in the main block, creating four separate divisions. Following the urgings of the prison Superintendent George and various official enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. Five spaces <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters.|$|E
5|$|Women's lacrosse, a {{non-contact}} {{version of}} the sport originating in Scotland during the 1890s, is played by twelve players per side, on longer fields and with less protective equipment than the men's game requires. In the 1930s Canadian businessmen established a version called box lacrosse to create business for ice hockey arenas during the summer months. Box lacrosse is played indoors, with smaller nets, between two teams of six players, and strongly resembles the game its areas <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breslau {{was built}} in 1901 by the Bremer Vulkan yard at Vegesack for the North German Lloyd line as the fourth of seven ships of the Köln class. The Köln-class ships, all named after German cities, <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the Bremen to Baltimore and Galveston route, and were {{specially}} fitted for steerage traffic. Though the class was designed with accommodations for 120 cabin-class passengers and up to 1,850 steerage passengers for service from Germany, Breslaus capacity was somewhat lower, with room for 66 cabin-class and 1,660 in steerage. The Köln-class steerage compartments had portholes for better light and ventilation than was typical, and included cabins that housed from four to ten passengers. Köln-class ships were specially designed to carry large freight loads on return voyages to Germany, with holds customized for carrying wheat and cotton.|$|E
50|$|Like the LGV Sud-Est, {{the line}} <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a nominal speed of 300 km/h, {{with a minimum}} curve radius of 4,000 m, and a space between track centres of 4.2 m. The second section <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> 320 km/h.|$|R

PMS is often divided among desktop-only software, client-server software, or Internet-based software.|$|R
50|$|MATILDA {{comes in}} many {{different}} models such as Urban Warrior, Block 2, and Scout Model. Each of these models <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a specific situation. The Urban Warrior <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> military use {{when it comes to}} aggressive situations such as bomb control, drone control, and rugged terrain. The Block 2 model <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a more tactical use for law enforcement and the fire department. This model is a jack of traits; it comes with the technology to be aggressive to a certain extent, but also comes with the ability to do reconnaissance. The scout model <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> pure reconnaissance and surveillance. This model is often used in the battlefield to get information or infiltrate enemy bases.|$|R
5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II coaches <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> {{long-distance service}} and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat {{accounted for the}} odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms {{at one end of}} the car. There is a baggage rack at the end of the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, M3 GMCs {{were being}} used by tank {{destroyer}} battalions in the North African Campaign, each of which consisted of 36 M3s and four 37mm M6 GMCs. The M3 GMCs, which <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> ambushing tanks, proved to be inadequate for this task in the battles of Sidi Bou Zid and Kasserine Pass, mainly due to poor tactics. Nevertheless, the M3 was later used in the Battle of El Guettar with success, claiming 30 German tanks, including possibly two Tiger tanks, {{at the cost of}} 21 M3s. Some M3s also saw service in Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), but by that time, the M10 tank destroyer had replaced it in the U.S. Army. A total of 1,360 M3 GMCs were also converted back into M3A1 half-tracks.|$|E
5|$|Designs for {{the asylum}} {{departed}} from comic interpretations {{of a large}} mansion and instead developed an entire island, with hints of Alcatraz prison, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear believable and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The intensive treatment unit has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by early twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a bunker, and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, 3 exterior areas, and 3 Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the game.|$|E
