5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those <b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be {{reckless}} before the first battle.|$|E
5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens <b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E

Again, the Court reiterated that {{it is up to the}} provinces to legislate protection for religious groups.|$|E

25|$|In Australia, a dummy bid (shill, schill) is a {{criminal}} offence, but a vendor bid or a co-owner bid below the reserve price is permitted, if clearly declared as such by the auctioneer. These are all official legal terms in Australia, but may have other meanings elsewhere. A co-owner {{is one of two}} or several owners (<b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> among themselves).|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 1962, Pope John XXIII {{opened the}} Second Ecumenical Vatican Council. The 21st ecumenical {{council of the}} Catholic Church {{emphasized}} the universal call to holiness and brought many changes in practices, including an increased emphasis on ecumenism; fewer rules on penances, fasting and other devotional practices; and initiating a revision of the services, which were to be slightly simplified and made supposedly more accessible by allowing the use of native languages instead of Latin. Opposition to changes inspired by the Council {{gave rise to the}} movement of Traditionalist Catholics <b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> with changing the old forms of worship.|$|E
25|$|Those <b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> {{with the}} AMA {{point to the}} case of Nosrat Khajavi. In 1996, Khajavi, an {{anesthesiologist}} in Yuba City, California, disagreed with a surgeon over the appropriateness of cataract surgery for a patient and refused to attend during the procedure. Khajavi was subsequently terminated from his anesthesia group. He sued for wrongful termination under California Business & Professions' Code Section 2053, and the suit was allowed by the California Court of Appeals. In 2000, the court held that Khajavi was not protected from termination on the basis of advocating for what he felt was medically appropriate care. The court did not rule on the merits of the dispute.|$|E

Unbeknownst to Minoru, the town is under attack from a swarm of giant bugs and {{encounters}} Elsa Bloodstone. Bloodstone informs Minoru that the attack is the result of an infection that is turning the populace into insects and takes her to meet Janine, whose daughter Alice has gone missing during the commotion.

25|$|Emergent {{structures}} are patterns that emerge via collective actions of many individual entities. To explain such patterns, one might conclude, per Aristotle, that emergent {{structures are}} {{other than the}} sum of their parts {{on the assumption that the}} emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply interact independently of one another. However, there are those <b>who</b> <b>disagree.</b> According to this argument, the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form. In fact, some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts, and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way. In particular renormalization are methods in theoretical physics which enables scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{and policymakers}} who address {{controversial}} safety-related {{issues have been}} targets of threats or violence {{for hundreds of years}} from those with strong feelings who wish to obstruct certain knowledge for the basis of evidence-based policy. More recently, researchers and their institutions have come under attack for work in the areas of firearms and motorcycle helmets. These sorts of things are known because they {{have been the subject of}} editorials in journals and even print and broadcast news stories. However, providers of scholarly information such as SafetyLit have also been harmed by those <b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> with part of its content. Some SafetyLit readers write letters to the agencies and organizations that provide funding for the project. Others take more extreme action to make their point. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been made against the SafetyLit servers. Other attackers organized their interest groups to subscribe to the SafetyLit email service and then to label the SafetyLit messages as unsolicited spam by using their internet service providers' automated reporting process. This in an unsuccessful attempt to block all users of that ISP from receiving SafetyLit email messages.|$|E

500|$|The {{publication}} of this essay, {{the title of}} which Esolen claimed he did not choose, was greeted with anger on the Providence campus from students and faculty alike. Providence students organized a protest march. A group of faculty members of the school wrote a petition in which they charged that Esolen's writings contained repeated [...] "racist, xenophobic, misogynist, homophobic and religiously chauvinist statements." [...] The Rev. Brian Shanley, O.P., President of Providence College, publicly distanced himself from Esolen's statements by claiming [...] "that he speaks only for himself." [...] Meanwhile, Robert P. George, a conservative Catholic professor at Esolen's alma mater, Princeton University, defended him. He argued that students and faculty members <b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> with him [...] "should respond in the currency of academic discourse—reasons, evidence, arguments—not by attempting to isolate, stigmatize, and marginalize him for stating dissenting opinions." ...|$|E

[...] The band's members were [...] "on the same page" [...] politically, sharing a liberal and progressive outlook. Mills admitted that there was occasionally dissension between band members on what causes they might support, but acknowledged [...] "Out of respect for the people <b>who</b> <b>disagree,</b> those discussions tend to stay in-house, just because we'd rather not let people know where the divisions lie, so people can't exploit them for their own purposes."

Redskin's spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response, saying, [...] "We respect those <b>who</b> <b>disagree</b> with our team's name, but we wish the United Church of Christ would listen {{to the voice of}} the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage and tradition of the Native American community."

Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech [...] "foreseeably create a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment", which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.

However, Apu, himself a vegan, reveals that she has eaten a tofu dog. Apu takes Lisa through a secret passageway to the Kwik-E-Mart roof, where they meet Paul and Linda McCartney.
