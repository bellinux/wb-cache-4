5|$|The Newby-McMahon Building is a four-story brick {{building}} {{located near the}} railroad depot in downtown <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> built in 1906 by Augustus Newby (1855–1909), {{a director of the}} <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> and Oklahoma City Railway Company. The oil-rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon, a petroleum landman and structural engineer from Philadelphia, was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building.|$|E
5|$|Lawton is {{primarily}} served by Interstate 44, {{designated as the}} H. E. Bailey Turnpike. It connects the city to Oklahoma City to the northeast and to <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> Texas, to the south. The city is also connected by US Highway 62, which connects to the regional towns of Altus {{to the west and}} Anadarko to the north. Other major thoroughfares include US Highway 277 and 281, which parallels the H. E. Bailey Turnpike to <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> to the south and leads to regional towns of Anadarko and Chickasha, respectively, to the north, and OK-7, which connects Lawton to Duncan.|$|E
5|$|The Newby-McMahon Building {{is among}} several {{historic}} buildings {{featured in the}} documentary film Wichita Falls: The Future of Our Past, a retrospective analysis of the city's architectural past produced in 2006 by Barry Levy, a public information officer {{with the city of}} <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E
5|$|In July 1949, Haynes became Inspector General, Military Air Transport Service (MATS) at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. He was {{appointed}} deputy commander for services of MATS two-month later, at {{the rank of}} major general. In January 1951, he assumed command of the 3750th Technical Training Wing at Sheppard Air Force Base, <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> Texas. Haynes retired in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Lawton {{is part of}} a bi-state media {{market that}} also {{includes}} the nearby, larger city of <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> Texas; the market, which encompasses six counties in southwestern Oklahoma and ten counties in western north Texas, has 152,950 households with at least one television set, making it the 148th-largest in the nation as of the 2016–17 season, according to Nielsen Media Research. KSWO-TV (channel 7), an ABC affiliate (which also carries affiliations with This TV and Telemundo on digital subchannels), is the only broadcast television station in the market that is licensed to Lawton, and its local news programming maintains a primary focus on southwestern Oklahoma in its coverage. All other major stations in the area, including KFDX-TV (channel 3; NBC), KAUZ-TV (channel 6; CBS, which is a sister station to KSWO through a shared services agreement but maintains separate operations on the Texas side of the market), and KJTL (channel 18; Fox), are based in <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls.</b>|$|E
5|$|The oil {{industry}} would ultimately {{prove to be}} a resource curse to <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{building}} housed {{a succession of}} tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because {{a sufficient number of}} local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded to the city of <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls.</b> As {{the building}} continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Born in Selma, Alabama, Mia was {{the fourth}} of six {{children}} of Bill and Stephanie Hamm. She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being born with a club foot. Hamm spent her childhood on various United States Air Force bases {{around the world with}} her family. While living in Florence, Italy, Hamm first played soccer, which was hugely popular there; her entire family quickly became involved in the sport. At age five, then living in <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> Texas, Hamm joined her first soccer team. Her father coached Mia and her newly adopted brother, 8 year old Garrett.|$|E
5|$|Hamm played sports from a {{young age}} and excelled as a {{football}} player on the boys' team at junior high school. As a high school freshman and sophomore, she played soccer for Notre Dame Catholic High School in <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls.</b> She played at the 1987 U.S. Olympic Festival, the youngest player {{to play for the}} United States women's national soccer team. As a new player, she often started as a forward but did not score a goal during her first year on the team. Hamm spent a year at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia, and helped the Lake Braddock soccer team win the 1989 state championships.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} while Grissom {{was still in}} high school, and {{he was eager to}} enlist upon graduation. He enlisted as an {{aviation}} cadet in the United States Army Air Forces, and completed an entrance exam in November 1943. Grissom {{graduated from high school in}} 1944, and was inducted into the United States Army at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, on August 8, 1944. He was sent to Sheppard Field in <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> Texas, for basic flight training, after which he was sent to Brooks Field in San Antonio, Texas, and then, in January 1945, was assigned to Boca Raton Army Airfield in Florida as a clerk.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bombing}} of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Nunn {{departed}} for Cincinnati, Ohio, to take flying lessons in hopes of becoming a B-17 pilot. By the time he finished his flight training, however, the Army had discontinued its air cadet program. On June 2, 1943, he enlisted in the Army and received his recruit training at Fort Wolters near Fort Worth, Texas. He was transferred numerous times. First, he was stationed at Sheppard Air Force Base near <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> Texas. Next, {{he was assigned to}} the 97th Infantry Division, then received additional training at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Finally, he transferred to the Army Medical Corps, but his back injury flared up, and he received a medical discharge on September 13, 1945. He held the rank of corporal {{at the time of his}} discharge.|$|E
5|$|Haynes and {{his wife}} toured the American West after his retirement, indulging {{themselves}} while searching for a permanent residence. Some of the general's friends suggested <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> the city of his last military post, but he left to assess the possibility of living in Taos, New Mexico, {{where he and his}} airman son hiked and explored ancient human settlements. Deciding against Taos, Haynes {{and his wife}} continued in their tour, soon finding Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to their liking. There, he bought two adjoining lots on North Carmelo Street with one existing house. Rather than accepting any of the offers he received promising an executive career in the aeronautics industry, he relaxed by hunting and fishing.|$|E
5|$|He stopped {{racing and}} opened a {{motorcycle}} dealership in <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> in 1966. The dealership is still open (as of 2008), {{and it is now}} the oldest Honda and Kawasaki dealership in Texas. He soon wanted to race again, so he built his own motorcycle and began racing as a 30-year-old. He raced in numerous types of motorcycle racing: cross country, drag racing, hare scramble, motocross, road racing, and short track. When Hill participated in a Daytona race in 1971, he had an opening lap at , which was faster than factory rider Gary Nixon. Hill continued to race motorcycles and in 1972 and won the Texas state road racing championship. Hill won over 100 trophies in his motorcycle career.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Hill's {{entered his}} first drag race at the Flying Fish Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod {{to the track}} and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his {{employer}} allowed him to scavenge {{while working as a}} sales engineer at a foundry in <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls,</b> Texas. He used the dragster to set the Texas state low elapsed time (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161miles per hour (259kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a Hot Gas race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event set the B/Gas dragster record at 163.04mph (262.39km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he set the a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84seconds and set the speed record in the class at 161.29mph (259.57km/h).|$|E

25|$|In 1961, Terry Southall, {{the first}} of Coach Southall's three sons, suited out for the Brownwood varsity squad. Coach Wood's team won eight games that season with one loss in non-{{district}} play, but a tie with Breckenridge also meant a tie for the district title. Breckenridge advanced to the state playoffs on penetrations, while the Lions turned in their gear.

The Lions scored one playoff victory before losing to Dumas 36-18 in the state quarterfinals and ending the season with eleven wins and one loss. 1963 produced a winning season for Brownwood, but two losses to Stephenville and <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> Rider kept them out of the state finals. The Lions ended the season with eight wins and two losses. 1964 was also a winning season, but seven wins wasn't enough that year. A tie with Graham and two losses to Cleburne and <b>Wichita</b> <b>Falls</b> Hirschi left Brownwood players sitting at home for another playoff series.|$|E
