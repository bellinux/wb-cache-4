It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter {{hole through the}} pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is poured into the hole – dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the epoxy <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> to the core and provide physical evidence.|$|E

This sucker is functionally {{analogous to the}} dorsal fin sucker possessed by the remoras or the pelvic fin sucker of the lumpsuckers, but is anatomically distinct; these similarities {{are the product of}} convergent evolution. Gobies can often be seen using the sucker to adhere to rocks and corals, and in aquariums they <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> to glass walls of the tank, as well.|$|E

25|$|Traditional orb webs are not {{effective}} for capturing moths, because only their scales <b>will</b> <b>stick,</b> allowing the moth to escape. The ladder webs of Scoloderus species {{appear to be}} adaptations in web design to increase moth capture. These webs extend vertically about seven times their width. When a moth slides down the web, it leaves a trail of scales until its body sticks to the web. However, these spiders {{do not seem to}} be closely related to bolas spiders. The nearest relatives seems to be the Cyrtarachneae (e.g. Pasilobus) of the Paleotropics. They also specialize on moths, and use threads that are beaded with sticky droplets. Celaenia and Taczanowskia species in South America seem to use chemical attractants to catch moths, too, and may also be closely related to bolas spiders.|$|E
500|$|Objects {{that are}} smaller than the katamari <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to {{determine}} if an object <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> to the katamari. [...] This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up. [...] Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, {{and they can be}} rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked. [...] In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up {{to the point where the}} katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.|$|E

In 2013, she said that, while she has left much aggression and profanity behind since leaving the sex industry, some of the issues that she developed <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> with her until the end of her life.

500|$|... "Mine" [...] is a country-pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 52 seconds. KILT-FM {{described}} [...] "Mine" [...] as [...] "an uptempo song that's unmistakably Taylor" [...] with [...] "a big chorus and [...] very singable." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 explained that the song [...] "is a mishmash of ideas bolted together by a terrific power-pop chorus that <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> in your brain after {{the second or third}} listen." [...] The song is set in the time signature of common time, and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from G3 to D5. It follows the chord progression of C2–G5–D5–C2–D5. Alan Macpherson of The Guardian noted that the song [...] "reprises the joyous rush of Swift's breakthrough hit, [...] "Love Story", but depicts love as an adult process rather than a teenage dream." ...|$|E
500|$|While Willis was {{editor of}} the Evening Mirror, its issue for January 29, 1845, {{included}} the first printing of Poe's poem [...] "The Raven" [...] with his name attached. In his introduction, Willis called it [...] "unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift... It <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> {{to the memory of}} everybody who reads it". Willis and Poe were close friends, and Willis helped Poe financially during his wife Virginia's illness and while Poe was suing Thomas Dunn English for libel. Willis often tried to persuade Poe to be less destructive in his criticism and concentrate on his poetry. Even so, Willis published many pieces of what would later be referred to as [...] "The Longfellow War", a literary battle between Poe and the supporters of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whom Poe called overrated and guilty of plagiarism. Willis also introduced Poe to Fanny Osgood; the two would later carry out a very public literary flirtation.|$|E

Graham declined the poem, which {{may not have been}} in its final version, though he gave Poe $15 as charity. Poe then sold the poem to , which paid him $9 for it, and printed [...] "The Raven" [...] in its February 1845 issue under the pseudonym [...] "Quarles", a reference to the English poet Francis Quarles. The poem's first publication with Poe's name was in the Evening Mirror on January 29, 1845, as an [...] "advance copy". Nathaniel Parker Willis, editor of the Mirror, introduced it as [...] "unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift... It <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> to the memory of everybody who reads it." [...] Following this publication the poem appeared in periodicals across the United States, including the New York Tribune (February 4, 1845), Broadway Journal (vol. 1, February 8, 1845), Southern Literary Messenger (vol. 11, March 1845), Literary Emporium (vol. 2, December 1845), Saturday Courier, 16 (July 25, 1846), and the Richmond Examiner (September 25, 1849). It has also appeared in numerous anthologies, starting with Poets and Poetry of America edited by Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1847.|$|E
500|$|On the [...] "EC" [...] set {{the next}} morning a {{reluctant}} Wendy joins a gray side-burned Cartman who promises he <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> to school-related questions and go easy on her. However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. She steps down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book [...] on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron, who turned the book into his new film, Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power. The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements, which include a student's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman's performance as president, causing him to run out the room crying, [...] "I'm doing the best I can!" ...|$|E
500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he <b>will</b> <b>stick</b> to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E
