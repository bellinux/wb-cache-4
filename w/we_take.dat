5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. We saw this courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory and <b>we</b> <b>take</b> strength from his example.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{business}} {{closed in the}} 1850s, it leaves an important legacy in many of our gardens and parks, since {{a number of the}} attractive plants <b>we</b> <b>take</b> for granted, were first introduced into cultivation by Loddiges Nursery.|$|E
25|$|Introjection: Identifying {{with some}} idea or object so deeply {{that it becomes}} {{a part of that}} person. For example, introjection occurs when <b>we</b> <b>take</b> on {{attributes}} of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation than we do.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{there may}} also exist zeros and poles at z = 0 and z = ∞. If <b>we</b> <b>take</b> these poles and zeros as well as multiple-order zeros and poles into consideration, the number of zeros and poles are always equal.|$|E
25|$|Example. <b>We</b> <b>take</b> f(x) as the S(x) defined above. This f is a 1-ary {{primitive}} recursive function. And so is g(x) = S(x). So h(x) {{defined as}} f(g(x)) = S(S(x)) is a primitive recursive 1-ary function too. Informally speaking, h(x) is the function that turns x into x+2.|$|E
25|$|If we further {{consider}} both spaces {{with the}} sup norm the extension map becomes an isometry. Indeed, {{if in the}} construction above <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the smallest possible ball B, {{we see that the}} sup norm of the extended sequence does not grow (although the image of the extended function can be bigger).|$|E

25|$|Personal responsibility, self-reliance, {{and mastery}} – We accept {{that we are}} the masters of our own destiny. We make {{decisions}} and live with the consequences of them.

25|$|The {{expectation}} based relationship {{will also}} hold in a no-arbitrage setting when <b>we</b> <b>take</b> expectations {{with respect to}} the risk-neutral probability. In other words: a futures price is a martingale {{with respect to the}} risk-neutral probability. With this pricing rule, a speculator is expected to break even when the futures market fairly prices the deliverable commodity.|$|E
25|$|By {{taking the}} limit of the {{expression}} as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral. We know that this limit exists because f {{was assumed to be}} integrable. That is, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.|$|E

25|$|In {{functional}} analysis and linear algebra the spectral theorem establishes {{conditions under which}} an operator can be expressed in simple form as a sum of simpler operators.

25|$|Thus, {{the total}} number of {{speakers}} of Berber languages in the Maghreb proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million. The vast majority are concentrated in Morocco and Algeria. The Tuareg of the Sahel adds another million or so to the total.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the one-parameter {{subgroup}} {{generated by}} any elliptic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every {{transformation in the}} subgroup fixes the same two points.
