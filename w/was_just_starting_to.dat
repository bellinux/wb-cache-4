5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing or learning about the art. Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E

Graham and Khan lobbied SOM partners to purchase a mainframe computer, a risky investment at a time, when new technologies <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> form. The partners agreed, and Khan began programming the system to calculate structural engineering equations, and later, to develop architectural drawings.|$|R

25|$|At {{this point}} in time, the idea of {{constructing}} a new tramway was revolutionary. The trend throughout the world had been to close existing tramways rather than open new ones, and only three relatively small tram systems remained in France (the Lille, Marseille and Saint-Étienne systems). In North America {{the very beginning of}} a light rail renaissance <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> be seen, with the Edmonton Light Rail Transit system opening in 1978, followed by the Calgary C-Train and San Diego Trolley systems in 1981. No significant new tramway system had been built in Europe in many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{two biggest}} moves the Astros {{made in the}} offseason were the {{acquisitions}} of Joe Niekro and José Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> use it {{when he came to}} the Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07. José Cruz was also a steal, in retrospect, from the Cardinals. Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Garibaldi Belt formation, {{a number}} of older, but related {{volcanic}} belts were constructed along the Southern Coast of British Columbia. This includes the east-west trending Alert Bay Volcanic Belt on northern Vancouver Island and the Pemberton Volcanic Belt along the coastal mainland. The Pemberton Belt began its formation when the former Farallon Plate was subducting under the British Columbia Coast 29million years ago during the Oligocene epoch. At this time, the north-central portion of the Farallon Plate <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> subduct under the U.S. state of California, splitting it into northern and southern sections. Between 18and five million years ago during the Miocene period, the northern remnant of the Farallon Plate fractured into two tectonic plates, known as the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates. After this breakup, subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate might have been coincident with {{the northern end of}} Vancouver Island eight million years ago during the late Miocene period. This is when the Alert Bay Belt became active. A brief interval of plate motion adjustment about 3.5million years ago may have triggered the generation of basaltic magma along the descending plate edge. This eruptive period postdates the formation of the Garibaldi Belt and evidence for more recent volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt has not been found, indicating that volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt is likely extinct.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success.

Moby <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was.

Having forced his way into manager Steve Bruce's plans, he started the opening match of the new Premier League season, playing the full 90 minutes against Birmingham at the Stadium of Light in a 2–2 draw. He also played the full 90 minutes in Sunderland's next league outing against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. However, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Sunderland's 1–0 win against Manchester City on 29 August 2010, which sidelined him for an expected six months. Steve Bruce said [...] "It's a tragedy. But Fraizer will be back. He's a larger-than-life character. He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> show what he was about.

500|$|In 2006, Cameron {{stated that}} if Avatar was successful, {{he hoped to}} make two sequels to the film. In 2010, he said the film's {{widespread}} success confirmed {{that he would do}} so. He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups. Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work [...] "once the novel is nailed down". He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus. The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest. He intended to capture footage for this sequel {{at the bottom of the}} Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible. In 2011, Cameron stated that he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story.

500|$|In 1992, {{the band}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour. On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played Ten in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band's tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band's audience expanded, saying that unlike before, [...] "everyone came." [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening {{and there was no}} stopping it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say he wanted to talk to Brett, the sound guy, and they'd carry him out there on their hands. You hadn't really seen that reaction from a crowd before..." [...] When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, [...] "We'd been on the road over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> get pretty intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever." [...] The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.|$|E
