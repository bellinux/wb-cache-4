40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an attempt}} at explaining and analyzing capital flight from Southeast Asia over the period 1970 to 2002. The research is organized into five questions. The first question is: What is capital <b>flight?</b> <b>We</b> review {{the literature on the}} meanings and measurements of capital <b>flight.</b> <b>We</b> define capital <b>flight</b> as the movement of capital from resource-scarce developing countries in order to avoid social control. The second question is: Was capital fleeing Southeast Asia? We employ a modified residual method to estimate capital <b>flight.</b> <b>We</b> measure capital <b>flight</b> as net unrecorded capital outflow, or the net of officially recorded capital inflows and recorded foreign exchange outflows. The third question is: Why was capital fleeing Southeast Asia? We examine direct and indirect linkages between capital flight and external borrowing, using a 2 ̆ 7 revolving door 2 ̆ 7 model, and other exogenous variables. The fourth question is: Should Southeast Asia worry about capital <b>flight?</b> <b>We</b> deal with a counterfactual situation, using a planning method and a multiplier method: if there was no capital flight and the capital was utilized in productive domestic activities, how much additional output and employment would have been generated? The last question is: What is to be done to address capital <b>flight?</b> <b>We</b> discuss some policy guidelines to restrain, reduce, and reverse capital flight. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} flight {{mechanics}} {{and control of}} birds and bird-size aircraft. It is intended to fill a niche in the current survey literature which focuses primarily on the aerodynamics, flight dynamics and control of insect scale <b>flight.</b> <b>We</b> review the <b>flight</b> mechanics from first principles and summarize some recent results on the stability and control of birds and bird-scale aircraft. Birds spend a considerable portion of their flight in the gliding (i. e., non-flapping) phase. Therefore, we also review the stability and control of gliding flight, and particularly those aspects which are derived from the unique control features of birds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present the}} design and {{implementation}} of a small Vertical-Take-Off-and-Landing (VTOL) aircraft. The vehicle requires minimal additional components to achieve the hover capability and is thus very efficient in forward <b>flight.</b> <b>We</b> improve over {{the state of the}} art by using a single controller in all flight modes without using blending between hover condition and fixed wing controllers or gain scheduling. We present a compact airflow estimation model for VTOL airframes which rely on the slipstream across control surfaces for hover attitude control. Furthermore we show attitude and position control results in simulation. Finally <b>we</b> show outdoor <b>flight</b> experiments validating our simulation results. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} and control of flapping flight of insects. To quantify {{the stability and}} to assess the control, we build a 3 D dynamic flight model, which {{takes into account the}} instantaneous coupling between the insect body and the wings. To compare with published results, we also implement a time-averaged model where aerodynamic forces are averaged over every wing-beat. To stabilize hovering <b>flight,</b> <b>we</b> design a control algorithm that incorporates a discrete sampling and a time delay within neural feedback circuits. Our study suggests conditions that the sampling interval and the delay time should satisfy so as to actively stabilize flapping <b>flight.</b> <b>We</b> also investigate how passive stability can be achieved for flapping flight by tuning wing attachment points. Finally, we extend our stability analysis and controller design to ascending flight. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Recent {{advances}} in small-scale flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles have extended {{the capabilities of}} flight control {{for a number of}} applications, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities. In this work, <b>we</b> demonstrate autonomous <b>flight</b> control of a 13 gram ornithopter capable of flying toward a target without remote assistance. For autonomous <b>flight</b> control, <b>we</b> developed 1. 0 gram control electronics integrated with a microcontroller, inertial and visual sensors, communication electronics, and motor drivers. We also developed a simplified aerodynamic model of ornithopter flight to reduce the order of the control system. With the aerodynamic model and the orientation estimation from on-board inertial sensors, <b>we</b> present <b>flight</b> control of an ornithopter capable of flying toward a target using onboard sensing and computation only. To this end, we developed a dead-reckoning algorithm to recover from the temporary loss of the target which can occur with a visual sensor with a narrow field of view. As a result, the 28 cm wing-span ornithopter flying toward a target landed within a radius of 0. 5 m from the target with more than 85 % success (N = 20). I...|$|R
