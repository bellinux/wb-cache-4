500|$|The book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2007 {{prompted}} a reevaluation {{of the book}} from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in Carousel magazine, wondered if {{the popularity of the}} Cat and his [...] "delicious naughty behavior" [...] will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, [...] "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues.

500|$|... "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] and [...] "Lois Kills Stewie" [...] are the 102nd and 103rd {{episodes of}} Family Guy respectively. They are {{the fourth and}} fifth episodes of the sixth season of the show. [...] "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] was written by {{executive}} producer and former Futurama and South Park writer David A. Goodman. The episode was directed by John Holmquist. [...] "Lois Kills Stewie" [...] was written by recurring voice actor and future showrunner Steve Callaghan, and directed by Greg Colton. Colton and Callaghan previously worked on the season 5 episode [...] "Whistle <b>While</b> <b>Your</b> Wife Works".|$|E

5000|$|The word jog {{originated}} in England in the mid-16th century. The etymology {{of the word}} is unknown, {{but it may be}} related to shog or have been a new invention. In 1593, William Shakespeare wrote in Taming of the Shrew, [...] "you may be jogging <b>whiles</b> <b>your</b> boots are green". At that point, it usually meant to leave.|$|R
500|$|... "Whistle <b>While</b> <b>Your</b> Wife Works" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of season five of Family Guy, the last episode {{produced}} for Season 4. The show originally aired on November 12, 2006. The plot follows Peter losing his fingers after an accident while holding fireworks. Behind on his work and threatened {{with the possibility of}} dismissal, he asks Lois to catch up on his work for him, to which she agrees. However, he repeatedly attempts to seduce her, eventually succeeding, distracting her from the work. Meanwhile, Brian begins dating a woman named Jillian who, much to Stewie's delight, lacks general knowledge and intelligence.|$|E
500|$|New {{recurring}} {{characters were}} also introduced in season five. The character of Jillian Fisher, Brian's new dimwitted girlfriend, {{was introduced in}} the episode [...] "Whistle <b>While</b> <b>Your</b> Wife Works". She provided an ironic counterpoint to Brian's intellectualism. Her final character personality was designed to be a stereotypical blonde, [...] "a bulimic cheerleader," [...] and [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree." [...] Her voice would later play upon the bulimic cheerleader element, with actress Drew Barrymore providing the voice of Jillian in eight episodes, five of which would be in season five. Other guest stars who made multiple appearances as recurring characters from previous seasons were Carrie Fisher as Peter's boss, Angela, and Phyllis Diller as Peter's mother. Seth MacFarlane's sister, Rachael MacFarlane, also made an appearance as Olivia, the child actress, when her character was apparently killed by Stewie in the episode [...] "Chick Cancer".|$|E
500|$|Green Hill Zone {{has also}} been {{recognized}} by critics as a classic, well-known video game level. It {{has been described as}} [...] "classic" [...] by Samit Sarkar of Polygon and by Jim Sterling and Chris Carter of Destructoid. Comparably, Joe Skrebels of Official Nintendo Magazine called it [...] "nostalgic", while Christopher Grant from Joystiq considered it to have a place [...] "in the center of your retro-gaming shrine". Kevin Wong of Complex stated that the game's and level's popularity were such that [...] "even if you didn't have a Genesis, this was the level you played at the department store <b>while</b> <b>your</b> parents went shopping." [...] Andy Kelly from Computer and Video Games called the Green Hill theme a [...] "monumental slice of Sega nostalgia", and GamesRadar writer Justin Towell also referred to it as classic. Anka has summarized that [...] "Green Hill Zone in the original game has gone down as an instantly recognisable piece of music in pop culture".|$|E

You keep {{waiting for something}} to happen, and after a <b>while</b> <b>your</b> mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are two guys in the woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, you go with it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E
500|$|Patrick Duffy {{returned}} to Dallas in 1986 after being absent {{for an entire}} season. The whole year's worth of episodes was written off entirely as Pam's dream. The storyline garnered the show a lot of publicity, both good and bad. The Staff of UGO Networks.com said: [...] "Soap Operas are known (and at times hated) for their ridiculously implausible storylines, and while '80s primetime suddser Dallas {{is still one of}} our favorite guilty pleasures, even the great Ewing empire is not immune to the absurd storytelling techniques the genre has become associated with. <b>While</b> <b>your</b> average primetime soap operas don't usually mingle with the stuff of sci-fi and horror, there's an incredibly high rate of characters returning from the dead in the genre. Case in point: Bobby Ewing. Presumed dead after being run over by his sister-in-law, Katherine Wentworth, who also happened to be obsessed with him, fans (and CBS) had to do without Patrick Duffy, and even worse, ratings, for one whole season. Thus, Larry Hagman, who played Duffy's onscreen brother and despised oil baron J.R. Ewing, along with network execs, persuaded Duffy to return, making it possible (we're talking in soap opera terms here), for Bobby Ewing's character to come back by writing off the ratings nightmare of a season as a dream... a very bad one." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{press was}} given an {{opportunity}} to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, [...] "an unqualified disaster". A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered. The Sunday Times called the C5 a [...] "Formula One bath-chair"; its reporter [...] "had travelled five yards outdoors when everything when phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule". The Guardians reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes, <b>while</b> <b>Your</b> Computer found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: [...] "The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive [...] "peep, peep" [...] noise signalling that the engine had overheated." [...] Even the distinguished former racing driver Stirling Moss ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported that while he had started out well, [...] "a jaunty smile on [...] face as he braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath", he ran into problems when he reached a hill: [...] "It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead. On a cold and foggy London day, the great man was visibly sweating." ...|$|E

500|$|Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U both {{garnered}} critical {{praise and}} were commercially successful, holding current ratings of 85/100 and 92/100 on Metacritic and 86.10% and 92.39% on GameRankings. Reviewers have particularly noted the large, diverse character roster, the improvements to game mechanics, and {{the variety of}} multiplayer options. Some criticisms in the 3DS version include a lack of single player modes and issues concerning the 3DS hardware, such as the size of characters on the smaller screen when zoomed out and latency issues during both local and online multiplayer. There were also reports of players damaging their 3DS Circle Pads while playing the game excessively. [...] The Wii U version's online play quality was mildly criticized for some inconsistency, but has overall been critically acclaimed. Daniel Dischoff of Game Revolution stated [...] "It's true that Super Smash Bros. evolves every time with regard to new features, items, and characters to choose from. [...] <b>While</b> <b>your</b> favorite character may not return or a few annoying pickups may force you to turn off items altogether, this represents the biggest leap forward Smashers have seen yet." [...] Daniel Starky at GameSpot criticized the inconsistent online performance in the game, but still called it an [...] "incredible game", noting [...] "With the Wii U release, Smash Bros. has fully realized its goals." [...] Jose Otero from IGN, praising the replayability of the game, states [...] "Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only {{to appeal to the}} nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Black & Blue" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. John Bergstrom of PopMatters described it as [...] "smooth, winning blue-eyed soul", and Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that its breathy vocals, piano chords and synth backing made it a [...] "successful blend of melancholy and dancefloor-ready rhythms". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian deemed the falsetto vocals and synths [...] "naggingly infectious", citing it as the band's strong point: [...] "the trio may be faceless, but they write a good tune". Sputnikmusic's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the [...] "techno swirl" [...] of the song [...] "nail the juxtaposition between Wyatt's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Black & Blue" [...] four stars out of five and recommended it for when [...] "you just need something to lift the spirits a bit, without someone shouting something stupid in your ear". He continued, [...] "It basically wants to rub your shoulders {{at the end of}} a long hard day, and whisper something funny in your ear <b>while</b> <b>your</b> shoulders untie." [...] Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy, it [...] "swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow". Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy McAloon's breathy vocal style on [...] "Black & Blue", but without the [...] "lyrical wit". He rated the song three stars out of five and called it [...] "decent", finding the remixes available on the release more interesting. A more critical review came from Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan, who wrote that it [...] "promisingly... splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole".|$|E

'Journey's End' is almost a two fingers up at technobabble; there's {{certainly}} tons {{of it in the}} episode, but it's largely irrelevant." [...] He praises the action sequences and the portrayal of Davros, Donna, Rose and the Doctor, but remarks that the overcrowding of minor characters made parts of the script seem [...] "underdeveloped" [...] and describes the Daleks as mostly [...] "annon fodder". [...] " [...] plot does hang together, but only just". [...] Overall, he describes the episode as [...] "exceptional" [...] but [...] "not perfect".|$|E
2500|$|Halladay {{was named}} the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think the one thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate <b>while</b> <b>your</b> team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often {{a player}} is {{confronted with a}} conundrum: You have good cards to hold but must throw to your {{opponent}} cards {{that are likely to}} score significantly in his (or her) crib. If you are dealt a hand composed of 10-10-8-7-6-2, your best opportunity to score points is to hold the 8-7-6-2: fifteen four and a run of three make seven. More importantly, this hand can be cut to ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen or sixteen. But to what extent does throwing a pair of 10s mitigate the usefulness of holding the deuce? By throwing a 10-deuce, the likelihood your opponent will score significantly in the crib is reduced, <b>while</b> <b>your</b> hand's possibilities still range from five (two less than thrown the [...] "better" [...] way, offset by throwing two less points to the crib) to twelve. The opponent's largest possible crib, your having thrown a 10-2, is fourteen, whereas throwing a pair of 10s offers the maximal possibility of twenty-two.(10,10,5,5,5) ...|$|E

2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, <b>while</b> <b>your</b> externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers.

Ibn Taymiyyah went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to Ghazan Khan, who was the Khan of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Iran, to plead clemency and to stop his attack on the Muslims. It is reported that none of the scholars said anything to the Khan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said: [...] "You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you Mu'adhdhins, Muftis, Imams and Shaykhs but you invaded us and reached our country for what? <b>While</b> <b>your</b> father and your grandfather, Hulagu were non-believers, they did not attack and they kept their promise. But you promised and broke your promise." [...] By early January 1300 the Mongol allies, the Armenians and Georgians, had caused widespread damage to Damascus and they had taken Syrian prisoners. The Mongols effectively occupied Damascus for the first four months of 1303. Most of the military had fled the city, including most of the civilians. Ibn Taymiyyah however, stayed {{and was one of the}} leaders of the resistance inside Damascus and he went to speak directily to the Mongol Ilkhan Mahmud Ghazan and his vizier Rashid al-Din Tabib. He sought the release of Muslim and dhimmi prisoners which the Mongols had taken in Syria, and after discussion, secured their release.|$|E
