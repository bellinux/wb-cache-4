5|$|At the time, no type {{specimen}} was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it {{was assigned to}} specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only V.thapsus specimen. The species had previously been designated as type species for Verbascum. European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the plant acquiring many synonyms over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar {{in size to}} Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered in orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> speculations about the possibilities for habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Notable {{classical}} composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentarō Taki. Popular {{music in}} post-war Japan has been {{heavily influenced by}} American and European trends, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the evolution of J-pop, or Japanese popular music. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{as a way}} {{to bring}} {{publicity}} to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman. He {{was also one of the}} first scientists to conceive the possibility of quantum computers. In 1984–86, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational perturbation theory) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak {{contains}} {{large tracts}} of tropical rainforest with diverse plant species, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{a number of them}} being studied for medicinal properties. Mangrove and nipah forests lining its estuaries comprise 2% of its forested area, peat swamp forests along other parts of its coastline cover 16%, Kerangas forest covers 5% and Dipterocarpaceae forests cover most mountainous areas. The major trees found in estuary forests include bako and nibong, while those in the peat swamp forests include ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), meranti (Shorea), and medang jongkong (Dactylocladus stenostachys).|$|E

Though the dance is established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin, turfing, jerkin', and krumping.|$|E
5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen {{into and out}} of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> its re-acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} extant work on astrology that is extensive, coherent, {{and mostly}} intact, the Astronomica describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the zodiac and astrology. The poemwhich {{seems to have}} been inspired by Lucretius's Epicurean poem De rerum naturaespouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the Astronomica features a lacuna, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.|$|E

In the resulting positions Black has found it difficult to generate any winning chances, and even finding equality has not been a simple task. The fact that one must know a lot of theory just to secure a draw has rendered the entire variation beginning with 9...b5 rather unattractive from Black's point of view, even though it appears to be objectively the best move.|$|E

Simone recalled how Madonna had struggled through her early days in New York city, and through her tough business mind and musical intuition had succeeded in crafting her own niche.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth {{to as many as}} 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E

5|$|Goldman united populations {{ranging from}} {{northern}} Veracruz through eastern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua south to far northwestern Costa Rica in the nominate subspecies, Oryzomys couesi couesi. He placed six other names as full synonyms of this form, {{which has its}} type locality in Guatemala—Oryzomys jalapae Allen and Chapman, 1897, from Veracruz; Oryzomys jalapae rufinus Merriam, 1901, from Veracruz; Oryzomys teapensis Merriam, 1901, from Tabasco; Oryzomys goldmani Merriam, 1901, from Veracruz; Oryzomys jalapae apatelius Eliot, 1904, from Veracruz; and Oryzomys richardsoni Allen, 1910, from Nicaragua. According to Goldman, individual variation within the subspecies is large, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{the large number of}} published synonyms, but populations from all parts of its range are essentially similar.|$|E
5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} {{a high level of}} social {{interaction}} between birds, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved {{to the front of the}} body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E
5|$|Moons in {{retrograde}} orbits cannot form in {{the same}} region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit, so Triton must have been captured from elsewhere. It might therefore have originated in the Kuiper belt, a ring of small icy objects extending outwards from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 50AU from the Sun. Thought to be the point of origin {{for the majority of}} short-period comets observed from Earth, the belt is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the plutinos) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.|$|E

5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E
5|$|Pilgrim {{numbers have}} greatly {{increased}} in recent years, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> numerous accidents and deaths due to overcrowding. The first major accident during Hajj {{in modern times}} occurred in 1990, when a tunnel stampede led {{to the death of}} 1,462 people. Afterwards, various crowd-control techniques were adopted to ensure safety. Because of large crowds, some of the rituals have become more symbolic. For example, it is no longer necessary to kiss the Black Stone. Instead, pilgrims simply point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba. Also, the large pillars used for pebble throwing were changed into long walls in 2004 with basins below to catch the stones. Another example is that animal sacrifice is now done at slaughterhouses appointed by the Saudi authorities, without the pilgrims being present there.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
