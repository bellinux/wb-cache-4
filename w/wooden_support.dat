25|$|Solid {{hardwood}} floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed {{perpendicular to the}} <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> beams of a building (the joists or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors {{as well as most}} traditional wood blocks, mosaics and parquetry.|$|E
25|$|When {{this picture}} was taken, almost every {{building}} immediately around St Paul's had burned down, with the cathedral surviving in a wasteland of destruction. Its survival was mainly {{due to the}} efforts of a special group of firewatchers who were urged by prime minister Winston Churchill to protect the cathedral. Twenty-nine incendiaries fell on and around the cathedral, with one burning through the lead dome and threatening to fall into the dome's <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> beams. Members of the volunteer St Paul's Watch would have had to climb through the rafters to have any chance of putting it out, but the bomb fell outwards from the roof onto the Stone Gallery, where it was quickly extinguished.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Nevins, Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Fire Department, {{arrived at}} the theatre around 11:26pm; he decided {{immediately}} that the building was lost and his job was one of confinement. Dieter Hotel, {{on the corner of}} Washington and Johnson streets, was lower than the theatre, its broad flat roof was an inviting target for flaming debris. The First Police Precinct station house, south of the theatre, was an old brick building with dry <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> beams. Ramshackle wooden frame buildings stretched down the block on Flood's Alley opposite the burning theatre. At that point, the prevailing wind was from the west, carrying smoke and cinders east, dropping firebrands onto these old structures. The Post Office, south of the police station house, was filled with paper mail. Nevins had called {{in the second and third}} alarms while on the way to the fire; when the additional equipment arrived, he deployed the engines around the block to keep adjoining buildings free of sparks and burning debris.|$|E
500|$|In late 2009, Six Flags Over Texas {{closed their}} Texas Giant wooden roller coaster for a $10 million {{renovation}} which {{took more than}} a year to complete. Idaho-firm Rocky Mountain Construction replaced the wooden track with a new steel I-Box track, retaining a <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> structure. The refurbishment was ultimately a success with [...] "resoundingly positive reviews from riders". The park's parent company, Six Flags, immediately began looking for other rides in its chain which would benefit from a similar overhaul.|$|E

500|$|The art {{style was}} {{influenced}} by a simplification approach, eliminating enough details but keeping overall shapes to make objects clearly recognizable. According to Antonio, they took inspiration for simplification from real-world photography, artwork, and from the environments of the games Journey, Team Fortress 2, and Mirror's Edge. They still wanted {{to ensure that a}} player would be able to recognize an area of the island they were in based on the visual appearance, such as by the types of trees around them, and assured there was enough distinction while simplifying the assets to make this possible. Blow's team was also able to engage with Fourm Design Studio, a real-world architecture firm, and Fletcher Studio, a landscape architecture team, to help develop the environments for The Witness. According to Fourm's founder, Deanna Van Buren, they developed the various manmade and cultivated areas based on the concept of three different civilization periods, with later civilizations building on the structures from earlier ones and repurposing these structures as needed. Their studios helped to bring design principles to the main development team, allowing them to then extrapolate their own ideas for the final game. Blow said that the guidance and advice of the architects helped to craft the island in a way that [...] "feels more immersive just because the details are in place, and your brain kind of picks up on it". Blow gives an example of how many of the buildings on the island are in various states of deterioration, but were designed as fully detailed and complete structures and purposely worn down to create the ruined look; the resulting structures retain logically-consistent details, such as the remains of <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> posts for rotted-away stairways in a castle, that aid in immersion for the player.|$|E
2500|$|Ntereso Found in 1952 by Oliver Davies, {{outlines}} of dwellings have been excavated {{since the early}} 1960s, and pieces of construction material such as fired clay and <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> poles have been found. Artifacts typical of a hunting-fishing community such as harpoons and fish hooks were discovered here. Clay figuines shaped like lizards and bovids were also discovered. [...] There is also evidence of animal husbandry being practiced.|$|E
2500|$|Most structures, however, like palaces, villas, commoner's houses, {{and other}} churches and monasteries, were built of {{alternating}} layers {{of stone and}} wood. The protruding <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> beams in these structures have been named [...] "monkey heads" [...] and are a staple of Aksumite architecture and a mark of Aksumite influence in later structures. Some examples of this style had whitewashed exteriors and/or interiors, such as the medieval 12th-century monastery of Yemrehanna Krestos near Lalibela, built during the Zagwe dynasty in Aksumite style. Contemporary houses were one-room stone structures or two-storey square houses or roundhouses of sandstone with basalt foundations. Villas were generally two to four stories tall and built on sprawling rectangular plans (cf. Dungur ruins). A good example of still-standing Aksumite architecture is the monastery of Debre Damo from the 6th century.|$|E
50|$|The Church of St. Dominic is a Roman Catholic parish church {{under the}} {{authority}} of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 1739 Unionport Road, Van Nest, Bronx, New York City. The parish was established in 1927. The Romanesque Revival was built 1925 to the designs of Bronx-native architect Anthony J. DePace of the firm DePace & Juster. In May 2011, two of the three bells were removed in order to service the <b>wooden</b> <b>supports</b> which were waterlogged and had seepage problems. The goal is to replace the <b>wooden</b> <b>supports</b> and return the bells to their original location. The expected restoration cost of the bells is estimated at $30,000.|$|R
50|$|Traditional Sirion√≥ {{houses were}} often only {{temporary}} structures with <b>wooden</b> <b>supports</b> and palm leaf roofs that could house up to 120 {{people at a}} time. Families were matrilineal and matrilocal, that is, young married couples would live in the wife's community.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wooden</b> <b>supports</b> {{depending}} {{on what kind of}} object they are used for are made from hard and soft woods. Some types of woods that artists use are poplar, beech, spruce, pine, chestnut, cherry, mahogany, and cypress. <b>Wooden</b> <b>supports</b> are susceptible to several kinds of deterioration. These include insect infestation, fluctuations in humidity/temperature causing warping and cracking, and structural damages. Cradling was previously used to correct warping by thinning the original structural support and then adhering the cradle to the reverse side of the support. However, it has become widely understood that cradling can be harmful to the paint and ground layers. Conservators today instead work to preserve what remains of the wood support rather than making corrections.|$|R
2500|$|The {{evidence}} at present {{is that the}} earliest type of European windmill was the post mill, so named {{because of the large}} upright post on which the mill's main structure (the [...] "body" [...] or [...] "buck") is balanced. By mounting the body this way, the mill is able to rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> was developed called the trestle. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the nineteenth century, when more powerful tower and smock mills replaced them.|$|E
2500|$|When Marty {{arrives in}} 1885, the DeLorean's fuel line is pierced by an arrow during an Indian attack. He and Doc patch it {{and attempt to}} use whiskey as a {{replacement}} fuel, since commercial gasoline is not yet available; the test fails, destroying the fuel injection and ignition systems and leaving the car unable to travel under its own power. Its final trip, from 1885 to 1985, is propelled by a steam locomotive that has Doc's version of [...] "Presto Logs" [...] (pressed wood treated with anthracite) added to the boiler to provide the extra power needed to push the car up to 88mph; once this speed is reached, the Mr. Fusion unit provides the power required to activate the flux capacitor and make the jump through time. Doc replaces the 1955-style wheels with cast iron train wheels that fit on the track rails. [...] He uses the old tires and a <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> to cushion the locomotive's [...] "cow catcher" [...] and the car's rear end. [...] Since {{each of the three}} [...] "Presto Logs" [...] fire at different intervals with increasing power, Doc installs a boiler temperature gauge on the DeLorean's dashboard to indicate when the car will experience a sudden burst of acceleration.|$|E

60|$|But Nina put {{the lamp}} out {{and turned back}} again towards the {{balustrade}} of the verandah, standing with her arm round the <b>wooden</b> <b>support</b> and looking eagerly towards the Pantai reach. And motionless there in the oppressive calm of the tropical night she could see at each flash of lightning the forest lining both banks up the river, bending before the furious blast of the coming tempest, the upper reach of the river whipped into white foam by the wind, and the black clouds torn into fantastic shapes trailing low over the swaying trees. Round her all was as yet stillness and peace, but she could hear afar off {{the roar of the}} wind, the hiss of heavy rain, the wash of the waves on the tormented river. It came nearer and nearer, with loud thunder-claps and long flashes of vivid lightning, followed by short periods of appalling blackness. When the storm reached the low point dividing the river, the house shook in the wind, and the rain pattered loudly on the palm-leaf roof, the thunder spoke in one prolonged roll, and the incessant lightning disclosed a turmoil of leaping waters, driving logs, and the big trees bending before a brutal and merciless force.|$|E
