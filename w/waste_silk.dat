40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: p-Chloronitrobenzene is a benzoic {{compound}} that {{widely used in}} many chemical industrials. p-Chloronitrobenzene may be absorbed through the skin and is suspected to causing cancer. So, developing an easy method to remove {{of it from the}} environment is necessary. Equilibrium isotherms and adsorption kinetics of p-Chloronitrobenzene onto modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> were studied experimentally. 			Materials and Methods: <b>Silk</b> <b>waste</b> was modified by HCl and used as an adsorbent to remove of p-Chloronitrobenzene from aqueous solutions. After preparing of adsorbent, the adsorption experiments were down in a batch system in an erlen mayer at different concentrations of p-Chloronitrobenzene (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mg/L), pH (2, 4, 6), dosage of modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 g/ 250 mL), temperature (20, 30, 40 oC) and contact time. 			Results: Data revealed that the adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene on to modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> was reached equilibrium after 20 min. The adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene decreased with the increasing of pH and the concentration of p-Chloronitrobenzene which is increased by increasing of modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> dosage. Also, data confirmed that changing of temperature did not have significant p-Chloronitrobenzene removal efficiency. Pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations were used to determine the kinetics of removal process. It was found that the adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene onto modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> was obeyed from pseudo-second-order kinetic model. 			 		 	 Conclusion: The results indicated the adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene onto modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> could be well fitted with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models...|$|R

Since the Brazilian silk production annually generates {{a large amount of}} waste during the silk fibers processing, this work explores the preparation and characterization of silk fibroin hydrogels using spinning <b>waste</b> <b>silk</b> fibers from textile processing and the processed ones. Hydrogels were obtained directly by dialyzing silk fibroin solutions against frequent changes of water until the gelation point and then lyophilized and characterized in terms of their morphology, crystallinity, thermal resistance and secondary structure. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the presence of β-sheet conformation related to sol-gel transition. FT-IR spectra indicated the coexistence of random coil (silk I) and β-sheet (silk II) structures, with predominance of β-sheet conformation for hydrogels from processed silk fibers. From thermogravimetric analysis the presence of β-sheet secondary conformation was demonstrated by a degradation peak around 292 °C for both hydrogels. Freeze-dried hydrogels presented sheet or leaf like morphology and no significant change was observed among the hydrogels from <b>waste</b> <b>silk</b> fibers and processed ones.

The extraction conditions of sericin from two <b>silk</b> <b>wastes,</b> pieced cocoon and inferior knubbs were studied to find the optimum extraction conditions.

30|$|Sericin {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} immune responses attributed to silk in general (Altman et al. 2003). Sensitization to silk leads to allergic reactions affecting the skin or respiratory tract, while silk as such can also cause an inflammatory response when {{in direct contact with}} living tissues. As a result, due to biocompatibility concerns, sericin has been largely neglected as a potential biomaterial. Although still underutilized, there has been a change over the last decade in the attitude regarding the potential applications of sericin in various fields of human activity. This was mainly prompted by environmental and economical concerns with respect to the large amounts of sericin, estimated to exceed 50, 000  t annually (Mondal et al. 2007), which have to be discarded as <b>waste</b> from <b>silk</b> processing factories, and also by the realization that sericin is a biocompatible material despite being traditionally regarded as a pathologic allergen. A comprehensive review (Kundu et al. 2008) presents a detailed account of current uses of sericin, chiefly from B. mori silkworms, in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, dietary foods, controlled drug administration, wound dressing, and media for cell culture. Some time ago, it was suggested (Minoura et al. 1995 b) that sericin on its own could be a biomaterial, which is obviously different from using it as a supplement in the cell culture medium.

Despite these advantages, the wide spread use of synthetic fiber- reinforced polymer composite is declining because of their higher cost and adverse environmental impact. On the other hand the use of natural fiber to develop environment friendly green materials are attracting researches worldwide due to their advantages like biodegradability, high weight, low-cost and high specific strength compared to synthetic fiber. In this category, silk is also a natural fiber. It is mainly branded as a status symbol of wealth and luxury. Just like any other conventional raw materials in silk manufacturing also wastes are generated during manufacturing.

Experiments were conducted under laboratory condition to assess the effect of different environment such as subzero, steam, saline water and natural conditions for various time lengths.
