Western tanagers have been observed foraging on Perry's agave (Agave parryi) nectar. Reports of western tanager eating Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) nectar, Russian-olive fruits, and human-provided food, including bird seed and dried fruit, were summarized in. Western tanagers are major consumers of <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworms</b> (Choristoneura occidentalis), and they have been observed eating Douglas-fir tussock moth larvae (Orgyia pseudotsugata). Hymenopterans, mostly wasps and ants constituted 75% of insects in western tanager stomachs in August. The other insects were beetles (Coleoptera, 12%), mainly click beetles (Elateridae) and woodborers (Bupestridae), true bugs (Hemipterans, 8%), grasshoppers (Orthoptera, 4%) and caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 2%).|$|R
40|$|Final Report / Contract on 43 - 8371 - 4 - 628 / For: USDA, Forest Service, Southwestern RegionRegional {{outbreaks}} of <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworms</b> (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman) have recurred {{at least three}} times in northern New Mexico since the early 1920 's when the U. S. Forest Service first began systematic forest-pest surveys and documentation (Lessard 1975, U. S. Forest Service documents). The current outbreak was first noticed in a small area on the Taos Indian Reservation in 1974, and since then the defoliated areas have increased in New Mexico and Arizona to more than 370, 000 acres of Federal, Indian, State and private lands (Linnane 1984). Losses in timber values can generally be ascribed to radial growth loss, height growth loss, topkilling, reduced regeneration, and mortality (Carlson et al. 1983, Fellin et al. 1983). A damage assessment project was initiated in 1978 and was aimed at obtaining measurements of some of these losses in budworm infested stands on the Carson National Forest, New Mexico (Holland and Lessard 1979). A large data base has subsequently been developed, including yearly measurements on topkilling, mortality, defoliation, and insect population changes (Stein 1980, 1981, Stein and McDonnell 1982, Rogers 1984). A growth assessment study was undertaken in 1982 to determine the feasibility of using dendrochronological methods to identify the timing of past outbreaks and to quantify radial growth losses associated with budworm defoliation (Swetnam 1984). Results of this work showed that three major outbreaks during the twentieth century were clearly visible in the tree-ring samples obtained from currently infested trees. The radial growth of host trees was corrected for age, climate and other non-budworm environmental effects, and then growth losses were computed as a percentage of expected growth (Swetnam 1984). Additional collections were obtained in 1984 in order to expand the scope of the radial growth study. The objectives included 1) assessment of a larger number of tree -ring samples, 2) comparison of radial growth losses between the two primary host species - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and white fir (Abies concolor), 3) comparison of radial growth losses between age classes, and 4) analysis of the relationship between yearly measurements of defoliation, insect populations and radial growth. This report summarizes the findings of the above analyses. Increment core samples from the 1982 collections are included here, therefore this report supersedes the earlier report (Swetnam 1984). Information is also presented on observations derived from the dated tree-ring series on the timing of occurrence of known and inferred <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> outbreaks for the past 284 years (1700 - 1983).

50|$|The budworm {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1914 in the United States, in Oregon. However, {{it was not}} initially recognized as {{a serious threat to}} coniferous forests in the western U.S. Aerial spraying apparently terminated some smaller epidemics in the southern and central Rockies; others subsided naturally. The insect then appeared to be dormant in US forests until 1922, when two outbreaks were reported near Priest Lake in northern Idaho. Since then, significant outbreaks in the Rockies and in the Pacific Northwest have caused top-killing and serious economic losses in tree growth. Tree mortality from budworm can occur in regeneration, sapling, and pole-sized trees. Trees in mature stands severely defoliated by the <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> may become susceptible to bark beetles, which kill mature trees.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman; WSB) is a {{widespread}} and destructive defoliator of commercially important coniferous forests in western North America. In British Columbia, Canada, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is the most prevalent host, and records show that significant outbreaks have primarily occurred in the southern interior over the last century. In the central interior of British Columbia, particularly in the Cariboo Forest Region, the most recent outbreak of <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm,</b> which is in its second decade, has been severe and widespread. It is perhaps due to this long outbreak, which is unprecedented in duration since detailed surveys began in the 1950 s, {{that there is an}} anecdotal perception that the <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> is expanding its range northward into the region, affecting Douglas-fir near the edge of its northern distribution. However, very {{little is known about the}} long-term outbreak history of <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> in the central interior of the province. In this study we used 11 Douglas-fir host chronologies and 2 regional Pinus non-host chronologies to reconstruct <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> outbreaks over a 435 -year period. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used to develop tree-ring chronologies at each site and the program OUTBREAK was used to detect outbreak periods. We reconstructed 12 outbreaks starting in early 1600 s with a mean return interval of 30 years. Sensitivity analysis illustrated that including light, moderate and severe intensity thresholds modified the number of reconstructed outbreaks, their duration and mean return interval. Sub-regional chronologies based on biogeoclimatic subzones and variants (BEC units), revealed strong synchrony of some outbreak events, but not all. Wavelet analysis of the sub-regional chronologies demonstrated the quasi-periodic behavior of <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> over the entire record, which averaged 32 -years. By reconstructing WSB dynamics over 400 years we demonstrated that outbreaks observed over the last 40 years in the Cariboo Forest Region are not unprecedented...|$|E

There is no clear reason for the positive insect response, but changes in foliage nutrient patterns and phenolic chemistry are indicated. Insect caused defoliation has been earlier reported to enhance successful colonization of Armillaria spp. on deciduous trees in the forests of the northeastern United States. The positive response of the fungus was attributed to a weakened tree condition. Conversely, although this study conclusively found water-limited trees to have increased susceptibility to A. ostoyae, defoliation significantly lowered Armillaria-caused infection and mortality. The decline in infection success is attributed to defoliation-caused reduction in plant water stress and an alteration of root carbohydrate chemistry. One and/or two years of defoliation {{did not appear to}} weaken the physiological condition of seedlings. Conversely, water-stressed seedlings that were also defoliated produced more buds, had an earlier bud phenology, contained higher total reserve carbohydrates, and had little Armillaria-caused mortality. The study suggests that during drought, short-term defoliation may be beneficial to grand fir and its associated forest community. Also, the additive effects of simultaneously occurring A. ostoyae and <b>western</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> may not be as severe as conventionally believed.
