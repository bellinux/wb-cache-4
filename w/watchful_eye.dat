5|$|Obama {{hosted the}} White House Passover Seder for all {{eight years of}} his administration. Among the annual traditions for the White House Seder were Obama's {{imitation}} of Pharaoh, Chaudhary's speech on the Hillel sandwich, and the hiding of the afikoman under the <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> of a Secret Service member. The Seder convened in the Old Family Dining Room and lasted for two hours. During Obama's last year in office in 2016, the Seder was held on April 26, the sixth day of Passover, due to Obama's previously scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia on {{the first and second}} nights of Passover.|$|E

They passed the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally trying to get away from Nora's <b>watchful</b> <b>eye,</b> Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E

5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, under the <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> of Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E
5|$|Scientist Hector Hammond is {{summoned by}} his father, Senator Robert Hammond, {{to a secret}} {{government}} facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body under the <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers {{at the cost of}} his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris. Back at the government facility, Hammond uses telekenisis to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller high above the floor. As she's falling, Jordan arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a pool of water which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Under the <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> {{of police}} detective Bobby Fulbright, Phoenix, Apollo and Athena become {{involved}} in several cases. Apollo and Athena investigate the murder of alderman Rex Kyubi. They face Simon Blackquill in court, who prosecutes despite serving a murder sentence himself. Additional content set after these events {{tells the story of}} Phoenix's first case after regaining his badge, having to defend an orca accused of killing her owner. Afterwards, Athena defends her childhood friend Juniper Woods who is charged with the murder of her teacher. Some time later, following a bombing at a space station, Apollo's friend Clay Terran is found murdered. During the trial, where Athena and Apollo defend an astronaut named Solomon Starbuck, a bomb goes off in the courtroom, injuring Apollo. Juniper is accused of the bombing, but Phoenix defends her and finds the real culprit. Feeling personally involved in the case, Apollo takes a leave of absence from the agency to investigate the case on his own while Phoenix takes over Solomon's case. He proves Solomon's innocence, but a new piece of evidence places Athena as the prime suspect.|$|E

25|$|The first written {{mention of}} Düsseldorf (then called Dusseldorp {{in the local}} Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa {{the small town of}} Kaiserswerth to the north of Düsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where {{soldiers}} kept a <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of Düsseldorf in 1929.|$|E
25|$|These {{movements}} did {{not escape}} the <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> of Napoleon, who detached {{a division of the}} Young Guard and a battery of the same Corps in support of his Left Wing, as also General Colbert's Brigade of Lancers from Count Pajol's Corps, to reinforce the Cavalry on the Left, and to preserve the communication with Ney.|$|E

The Marshall islanders were formerly aggressive, but the influence of the mission churches eliminated most conflict. They took pride in extending hospitality to one another, even distant relatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} of this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably {{to reduce the}} Danish fleet. But he continued to keep a <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> over the Baltic, and in 1170 destroyed another pirate stronghold, farther eastward, at Dziwnów on the isle of Wolin. Absalon's last military exploit came in 1184, off Stralsund at Whitsun, when he soundly defeated a Pomeranian fleet that had attacked Denmark's vassal, Jaromar of Rügen.|$|E

Thereafter royal princes were confined to the capital. Their power struggles continued, but at court under the king's <b>watchful</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

25|$|Harris {{had been}} a genuine pace bowler – albeit a wayward one – as a junior cricketer, but decided, under the <b>watchful</b> <b>eye</b> of mentor John Bracewell, to {{sacrifice}} a few yards of pace for accuracy. His gentle looping swing bowling makes the batsman work hard, as the ball {{is less likely to}} speed to the boundary, and the deceptiveness of the ball's speed often leaves them attempting to play the ball too early.|$|E
25|$|The SD was {{the chief}} organ of the {{information}} service of the party. Its task was to inform the top Party leaders of all opposition movements and forces at home and abroad.
