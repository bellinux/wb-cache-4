500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of that. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!" [...] This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
500|$|Wolstencroft {{stated that}} after {{watching}} the episode with his friends, they both commended and criticised his work: [...] "I got some angry phone calls from my friends the next day saying 'how could you, but well done, but how could you, but she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nice,</b> but how could you, but well done'." [...] Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that {{it came from a}} result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." [...] In a January 2010 poll, fans of the show voted Helen's death as the [...] "most shocking death scene" [...] in the series, drawing 49% of the votes.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{scheduled}} to premiere at RKO's flagship theater Radio City Music Hall on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941 for such magazines as Life, Look and Redbook. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (and Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a [...] "vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man" [...] and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography. Friday magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons, Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers. Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> to him and that she should [...] "wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss." [...] Welles immediately denied making the statement {{and the editor of}} Friday admitted that it may be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.|$|E

500|$|After {{the inaugural}} race, {{organizers}} improved the marking {{of the trail}} for the first contest held in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks direction. Musher Bill Cotter said, [...] "The trail <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> {{that it was difficult}} to keep from going too fast." [...] The race grew in popularity over the next few years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 completed the race—the most that have ever finished it. In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs became the first (and so far only) mother and daughter to compete in the same Yukon Quest: Terri finished 21st, beating her mother (22nd) by 26minutes. The 1991 race saw eight teams withdraw in the first quarter because of an outbreak of a canine disease called the [...] "Healy Virus". Thirty-five more dogs were sickened before the spread of the virus was halted by colder weather halfway through the race. In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused problems {{in the first half of}} the race, and the second was affected by bitter cold. The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was replaced after she offered canine acupuncture to several mushers. Though not then forbidden by any rule, this violated equal-treatment guidelines because she did not offer the treatment to every musher. At the end of that race, George Cook became the first musher since 1984 to finish short of Whitehorse when open water on the Yukon River prevented him from continuing. Because he did not quit, race officials gave him the Red Lantern Award.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, but it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> to see her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise {{to keep in touch}} and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E
