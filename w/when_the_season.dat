5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of exhaustion and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, replacing them with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Nieuwendyk {{entered the}} 1995–96 season unhappy with his {{contract}} status. Unable {{to come to}} terms with the Flames, he had gone to arbitration, and was awarded a contract worth C$1.85 million, but insisted on renegotiating the deal into a long-term contract extension. He refused an offer of a three-year, $6 million contract from the Flames, and as the dispute dragged on, chose not to join the team <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> began. He remained a holdout until December 19, 1995, when the Flames traded him to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Jarome Iginla and Corey Millen.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} end of the 2002–03 season, Goater {{announced}} his intention to leave Manchester City <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> finished in order to seek regular first team football. In his final match for Manchester City, he was asked to captain the side in Manchester City's final game at Maine Road. In total, Goater scored 103 goals in 212 appearances for Manchester City. Since ending his footballing career, Goater has been critical of both Kevin Keegan, who he claims never praised him and Nicolas Anelka, who he feels wanted to be 'the daddy' of Manchester City.|$|E
5|$|As {{the reigning}} most {{valuable}} player, Richard sought a pay raise {{prior to the}} 1947–48 season. General manager Frank Selke refused, even after Richard and team captain Émile Bouchard both sat out the Canadiens' preseason before capitulating and returning to the team <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> began. The Punch line was broken up after Blake suffered a career-ending leg injury. Richard's season also ended early as he missed the final {{games of the season}} due to a knee injury. He finished second in team scoring with 53 points in 53 games, but Montreal missed the playoffs. After recording only 38 points in 1948–49, Richard posted a 65-point campaign the next season and his 43 goals led the NHL for the third time. In 1950–51, Richard scored 42 goals, including his 271st career goal, making him Montreal's all-time goal leader.|$|E
5|$|BSR Housewares {{became the}} club's first shirt sponsor during the 1981–82 season. The club's shirts have been {{sponsored}} {{for the majority}} of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Other sponsors have included T-Mobile (2004–08), Homeserve (2010–11), Bodog (2011–12), Zoopla (2012–14), Intuit Quickbooks (2014–15), TLCBET (2015–16) and K8 group (2016–2017).|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or {{near the bottom of the}} league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> concluded, the writers had not decided what would happen with the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} months of 1894, Robey {{returned}} to London to honour {{a contract for}} Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred {{in a series of}} stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of Dick Whittington, for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress Ada Reeve felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ended, while the comedian Barry Lupino was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.|$|E

5|$|Schroeder {{spent the}} summer prior to the 2013–14 season {{recovering}} from shoulder surgery. He then fractured his left ankle in the Canucks first preseason game of the year. By mid-October Schroeder returned to the Canucks; however he only played three games before once again fracturing his left ankle; surgery was required after this injury, keeping him out until January 2014. Prior to rejoining the Canucks, Schroeder played two games with their AHL affiliate, the Utica Comets, recording one assist. He would ultimately play 25 games with Vancouver during the season, recording six points. As a result, the Canucks did not tender Schroeder a qualifying offer <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ended, making him an unrestricted free agent. He was then signed to a two-year, two-way contract by the Minnesota Wild on July 11.|$|E
5|$|Slaviša Jokanović left Watford {{at the end}} of his one-year {{contract}} after he, and the club, failed to reach new contractual agreements; he was replaced in June 2015 by the Spaniard Quique Sánchez Flores. Watford's first fixture in their return to the Premier League was a 2–2 draw with Everton. In the 2015–16 season, Watford reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a goal by midfielder Adlène Guedioura against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, ending Arsenal's bid to win the competition for three successive times, and finished 13th in the Premier League, despite the club being, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> began, a favorite among betting shops to be relegated. Sanchez was sacked in May 2016, a decision that Flores subsequently attributed to the difference between how the owners and himself assessed Watford's ongoing season, and replaced by Italian coach Walter Mazzarri.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Smith's run of {{consecutive games}} {{came to an}} end against Reading in October 1958, with Jim McCusker coming into the side to replace him for two games. Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and Charlie Bicknell. He played 26 further games in the 1958–59 season, in which the club finished 11th in the newy-formed Third Division. The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31. His last game was a 2–1 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league, keeping a club record 70 clean sheets. His record stood until it was broken by Paul Tomlinson in the 1990s. When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a benefit match.|$|E

5|$|Toledo's team, under {{financial}} {{pressure at}} season's end, worked to relieve themselves of their expensive contracts. Not yet fully {{recovered from a}} rib injury sustained in July, Walker was released by the Blue Stockings on September 22, 1884. During the offseason, Walker took a position as a mail clerk, but returned to baseball in 1885, playing in the Western League for 18 games. For {{the second half of}} 1885, he joined the baseball club in Waterbury for 10 games. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ended, Walker reunited with Weldy in Cleveland to assume the proprietorship of the LeGrande House, an opera theater and hotel. According to Zang, Walker could afford the business venture after commanding a $2,000 contract as a major leaguer. Though he could no longer negotiate such a salary, his skills were still highly attractive to teams: Walker returned to Waterbury in 1886 when the team joined the more competitive Eastern League.|$|E
5|$|As the 2003 season began, Robertson was {{competing}} alongside Brad Lidge, Kirk Saarloos, and Pete Munro for {{the final}} spot in the Astros' starting rotation. He pitched the entire month of spring training, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> began he was granted the final spot in the rotation. Robertson made his season debut on April 3, and allowed eight earned runs in 4⅓ innings, losing the match against the Colorado Rockies 10–5. He got his first career victory on April 10, allowing two hits in seven innings in a 4–2 victory against the Cincinnati Reds. He struggled in his next three starts, {{and by the end}} of April Robertson had a 1–3 record and an ERA of 7.99, which caused manager Jimy Williams to consider moving him back to the bullpen. After a May 2 matchup against the Atlanta Braves further increased his ERA, Robertson was demoted to the minor leagues, but only played with the Zephyrs for one game before being placed back on the major league roster ten days later.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1986–87 season, Rush {{announced}} his intention to leave Liverpool for Italian team Juventus <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> was finished. Rush did not want to leave but the club decided to sell him, as they were short of money due to their expulsion from European competition. Midway through the season, Dalglish signed John Aldridge to replace Rush when he left. Prior to his departure, Rush scored 40 goals. Liverpool finished second in the league behind Everton, and were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Luton Town. The club did reach the 1987 Football League Cup Final, but they were beaten 2–1 by Arsenal. At the end of the season, Dalglish signed Peter Beardsley and John Barnes to improve their attack. Liverpool regained the league championship; they did not suffer defeat until their 29th match against Everton, one of two losses during the season. The club had the chance to complete the double, as they reached the final of the FA Cup against Wimbledon. Although favourites against a club who had only {{become a member of the}} Football League eleven years previously, they lost the match 1–0.|$|E

5|$|Ballard {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a third-pairing defenseman in his second season with Vancouver. He missed five contests in November and December 2011 due to a back injury, before sustaining a season-ending concussion on February 5, 2012. Initially undetected, the injury was caused by two separate hits during a game against the Colorado Avalanche. He remained in the lineup for the following contest before being diagnosed with the injury. His season ended with 1 goal and 7 points over 47 games. His third season with the Canucks was shortened by the 2012–13 NHL lockout. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> started Ballard was again on the Canucks third pairing with Tanev. Early in the season the two were the Canucks' most consistent pairing. An injury to Kevin Bieksa allowed Andrew Alberts to get into the line-up and split the Ballard-Tanev pairing. After Bieksa's return it was Ballard who was removed from the line-up becoming a healthy scratch. In late March Vancouver suffered several injuries up front to help fill the void Ballard returned to the line-up as a forward. He played three games before suffering a broken foot. Though he was healthy by the playoffs Vancouver opted to play Alberts and rookie Frank Corrado in the first round lost to San Jose. He finished the year playing in 36 games and recording two assists.|$|E
5|$|Clyde began 1974 {{season with}} a 3–0 record, but became embroiled in {{controversy}} following a dispute between new manager Billy Martin and general manager Bobby Brown. Martin and Brown argued about what {{was the best way}} on handling Clyde's future development, which led to Brown's resignation and caused Clyde to miss a month before remaining on the Rangers roster {{for the rest of the}} year. He played in 28 games (21 starts) and finished with 3–9 record, and a 4.38 ERA. He started one game in 1975 (a loss) before injuring his shoulder and was demoted to the Pittsfield Rangers of the Eastern League. He stayed in the minors for three seasons, having a shoulder operation in 1976. The Rangers organization lost so much faith in Clyde's ability that he was left unprotected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but was not chosen. He played for the Sacramento Solons in 1976, and the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League in 1977 where he had 5–7 record with a 5.84 ERA. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ended, the Rangers traded Clyde and veteran Willie Horton to the Cleveland Indians for Tom Buskey and John Lowenstein on February 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|The win was not {{followed}} with more {{success and the}} team performed badly in the following seasons. At the AGM in October 1982, {{it was revealed that}} the club were in £1.6million of debt, mainly due to escalating wages and building costs, including the construction of the North Stand. At the end of November Ron and Donald Bendall resigned from the board to be replaced by Doug Ellis, who bought Ron Bendall's 42% shareholding. In January 1983, Villa beat Barcelona 31 on aggregate to win the 1982 UEFA Super Cup. Barton remained in charge for two seasons after the European Cup triumph, but was sacked {{at the end of the}} 198384 season despite Villa finishing tenth in the First Division and reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup. Shrewsbury Town manager Graham Turner was brought in as his successor. Turner was unable to reverse the decline, and in 1986 Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division. A lacklustre start to the following season saw Turner sacked halfway through September. Billy McNeill was hired in his place, but was unable to save Villa from relegation. They were relegated to the Second Division just five years after winning the European Cup. McNeill handed in his notice and moved to Celtic <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ended. Chairman Ellis persuaded Watford manager Graham Taylor to take over the reins and set about rebuilding the team.|$|E
