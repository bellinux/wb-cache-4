50|$|Already in May 1938, after cracks {{had been}} {{discovered}} in the conventional armour of the M36 vehicles, the ministry of defence had asked DAF whether their type, using untried welding techniques, could also be prone to cracking; {{in the summer of}} 1938 the commander of the 1e Eskadron Pantserwagens while testing the demonstrator vehicle had also expressed his concerns on this matter. Despite the warnings by Addink, Van Doorne pretended that he was unconcerned. Nevertheless the May 1939 contract had contained a <b>warranty</b> <b>clause,</b> instructing DAF to weld all connections tension-free and making DAF liable for all defects of this nature. Late March 1940 during cleaning it was discovered that on three of the six vehicles the welds of the machine gun mounts were cracking. One vehicle was sent to DAF that rewelded the crack and reinforced the glacis by riveting a steel plate behind it. Soon however, it transpired that next to the reinforcing plate a new crack had appeared. In April the number of cars showing cracks had risen to five and on some of these the welds between the glacis and bottom plates were starting to crack also. According to DAF the defects had been caused by attaching the mounts after the vehicles had been largely finished. The Comissie Pantserautomobielen concluded that, as war was imminent, DAF should be allowed to quickly repair the cracks by rewelding and fitting reinforcement plates but that ultimately the armour plates had to be completely replaced.|$|E
40|$|Many Departments of Transportation (DOTs) {{have made}} {{tremendous}} efforts for managing their civil infrastructure systems effectively {{and to meet}} public demands for their performance and safety. The introduction of warranties help many DOTs keep their construction with better quality by shifting post-construction responsibilities to contractors. Warranties are applied to numerous items according to each DOT’s needs, and this research focuses on steel bridge painting protection policy for Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT). This research represents {{the development of an}} implementable <b>warranty</b> <b>clause</b> for protecting steel bridge painting and the image processing technique for the objective and quantitative painting quality assessment. In the <b>warranty</b> <b>clause</b> development, extensive literature review was performed and many currently used steel bridge painting warranties were analyzed and compared. It was found that eleven items consist of the core issues for successful bridge painting warranty projects. The eleven elements are warranty period, defects definition, inspection schedule, repair procedure and progress schedule for correction work, season of work, liability insurance, traffic control, supplementary performance bond, supplementary lien bond, surety company, and work permit. These elements are used to framework INDOT’s <b>warranty</b> <b>clause</b> for protecting its steel bridge painting. In addition, this report proposes the various image processing techniques that can recognize the rust on the steel bridge surfaces. The computerized techniques are constructed for unbiased rust recognition and percentage determination in terms of distance, angles, brightness, and cleanness. The report explains the theoretical background and the application procedures and examples. Random sampling plan and stepwise applications are also proposed...|$|E
25|$|Ian Narev, {{the current}} CEO, was the Group Head of Strategy, with {{responsibility}} for corporate strategy development, mergers and acquisitions and major cross- business strategic initiatives. He led the Group’s $2.1 billion acquisition of Bankwest in 2008, and developed the strategy outlined below. The Share Sale Deed provisions provided the CBA at clauses 4 & 10 with price adjustment provisions. The <b>Warranty</b> <b>Clauses</b> are, 15.1, 15.3, 16.1, 16.2, schedule 6 cl 5.1 and clause 12 (c) of the Share Sale Deed provided the CBA with a $4 billion short term loan {{in support of the}} <b>Warranty</b> <b>Clauses.</b> (Refer the Share Sale Deed and the December 2015 CBA testimony to the PJC). The warranty provisions of the Share Sale Deed, enabled the CBA to deduct amounts from the HBOS $2,797 million loan it had secured (refer above), for pre acquisition BankWest loans it (the CBA) deemed retrospectively impaired.|$|R

Since {{the enactment of}} Title 10, Section 2403 of the United States Code in 1985, written <b>warranty</b> <b>clauses</b> have been mandated for the procurement of all major weapon systems. This thesis discusses the aircraft engine warranty program established by the Naval Air Systems Command {{in response to that}} warranty legislation. Warranty procedures and issues are examined during procurement, contract negotiations, and in the daily operations of the fleet. The aircraft engine warranty program of a major commercial airline (United Airlines) is presented to allow the reader to form a basis from which to make program comparisons. Those areas in which a commercial warranty may be applicable to a military environment are described and analyzed. Conclusions are drawn concerning the effectiveness of the Navy's warranty program and recommendations are suggested for improvements and/or follow on studies.

40|$|Wilcken's {{commentary}} on UPZ 1, 112, col. II, 11. 5 ss. (anyway partly lost), based on Polyb., VI, 17, 4, has raised in its turn {{the idea that}} the Polybian passage, describing how the Roman public lease system worked, implies the obligation to give also « secondary guarantors » to the state (in other words a « surety of the surety »). This article reconsiders the problem radically : through an analysis of the <b>warranty</b> <b>clauses</b> in the Hellenistic and Roman world it shows that a praxis to claim a « surety of the surety » did not exist anywhere. Therefore a new and different interpretation both of UPZ 1, 112, col. II, 11. 7 - 10 and the Polybian passage is suggested. Geraci Giovanni. Documenti ellenistici e appalti di stato romani.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedWithin the Department of Defense there {{continues to be}} considerable confusion and debate over {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>warranty</b> <b>clauses</b> required on major weapon system production contracts. Despite {{the fact that they have}} been mandated by law since 1985, and that their costs are estimated at over two percent of total hardware costs, a uniform process to ensure their proper development and administration does not exist. Because of the politics involved, Program Managers have received considerable direction in the form of "thou shalt", but virtually no guidance as far as "how to". Fortunately, significant efforts have been made by individual programs to correct problems experienced in the past and execute warranties that make sense. Their focus, however, has been on improving warranty administration. In contrast, this thesis looks at the warranty development process and discusses the potential improvements from the early integration of the warranty development into an aircraft engine's acquisition strategy. The findings of this report support avoiding insurance warranties, changing the Navy's "no-cost" warranty policy, and including warranty reviews as part of the Milestone review 1 process. There is potential for significant reductions in life cycle costs from this approach and universal applicability across all platforms and services. U. S. Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

40|$|As operações de compra e venda de participação societária seguem no Brasil um modelo importado do direito estrangeiro. Dentre diversos institutos importados, existem as cláusulas de declarações e garantias e suas qualificadoras. O objetivo do presente trabalho é examinar a validade da qualificadora “no melhor conhecimento” no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro e sua eficácia dentro dos limites impostos por esse ordenamento. Busca-se, para tanto, analisar o conceito da qualificadora em seu sistema originário, a Common Law, e posteriormente trazer a discussão para o ambiente jurídico do ordenamento brasileiro, propiciando a conclusão que a validade da inserção da cláusula decorre do princípio da autonomia privada, mas está limitada pelos valores trazidos pelo princípio da boa-fé objetiva e seus deveres relacionados. Uma vez verificada a validade do instituto jurídico no ordenamento brasileiro, sua eficácia está relacionada à alocação de responsabilidade entre partes sobre o conhecimento e as consequências dessa alocação.

It seeks, therefore, to analyze the concept of the “best knowledge” qualifier in its original system, the Common Law, and then bring the discussion to the legal environment of the Brazilian system, enabling the conclusion that the validity of the clause follows the principle of freedom of choice but it is limited to the values brought by the principle of objective good-faith and its related duties. Once verified the validity of the legal institute in the Brazilian legal system, its effectiveness relates to the allocation of responsibility between the parties related to knowledge and the consequences of this allocation...|$|R
40|$|Already in {{the twelfth}} century, men canvassed {{different}} {{views on the}} ways in which they thought lordship ought to be exercised. They used their picture of how an idealised "Good Lord" [...] a familiar label in later times [...] comported himself to assess the treatment they actually received from their lords. This Good Lordship had both Positive and Negative aspects: the "good lord" maintained his vassals in their honours and renounced his right to revoke grants afterwards. One excellent way to study the pursuit of this double ideal is through the language of charters, more particularly through the <b>warranty</b> <b>clauses</b> by which Good Lordship was often implemented. The transformation of warranty into its familiar Common-Law shape reflects corresponding and complex changes in both lord-vassal relations and the role of the King and his justice. 	Warranty actually began as a security device, designed to keep men to their word, and is found used in this sense over wide areas of sub- Carolingian Europe. It was probably imported to England by the French, and can be seen in twelfth-century charters progressively superseding other forms of words to become the classic "guarantee" of Good Lordship. In this manner it came by 1200 to be virtually equated with the lordship it had originally been used to enforce. Warranty was lordship seen from the vassal's point of view, that is, tenant-right. 	Despite this origin in very personal relations, warranty probably always created between the parties' heirs some kind of obligation, which sharpened and was made infinitely more clear-cut with the emergence of full legal inheritance rights. Warranty swelled to full tenant-right, a full guarantee of the Right to Good Lordship. 	As the heir's claim grew into an enforceable right of inheritance through increasing access to remedies by royal justice, and because such justice tended to strict construction, warranty became a contractual addition to which claimants had to prove their entitlement. The narrative of legal change from 1150 argues for gradual evolution but also suggests 1153 - 4 as the decisive turning-point in this development. 	Detailed (sometimes technical) examination of evidence for some relevant cases, royal writs concerning warranty and the turning-point of 1153 - 4 is reserved for three appendixes...|$|R

I argue, counter-intuitively, that contracts with long fine prints are no more complex and baffling to consumers than any alternative boilerplate-free templates of contracting. Therefore, there is no alternative universe in which consumers enter simpler contracts better informed of the legal terms. in addition, I argue that any policy that mandates consumer-friendlier arrangements (such as ones the eliminate boilerplate arbitration <b>clauses,</b> <b>warranty</b> disclaimers, or data collection) would hurt consumers in an unintended but potentially costly way...|$|R
40|$|A {{business}} is always dependent on its customers. It is therefore important to ensurethat customers {{are satisfied with}} the product and the warranty included. The {{study was conducted in}} cooperation with the building contacting companySkanska Sweden. The aim is to use interviews to collect and process experiences in order to answer the question: How should the recovery process in the construction industry be performed to ensure a professional handling of warranty? The results have shaped my conclusions and I have turned them into a proposal that companies in the industry can benefit from. The study indicates that the industry is not geared for a five year warranty, which was introduced in 2004 and 2006. This is manifested by difficulties to prioritize the management of guarantees, with long lead times and customer-, and employee dissatisfaction as a result. Achieving a professional management means to adapt the company to a longer warranty. It means taking responsibility, prioritizing and investing in the organization and effective computer systems. The investment will help to create a stronger brand and increase the profitability for the company. The results suggest that companies should set aside time for staff and implement an aftermarket organization that supports and relieves the staff. An important aspect is that a financial liability for the guarantees should be anchored in the production staff. Otherwise it can result in a reduced quality due to lack of responsibility during the construction process, leading to increased warranty costs. The industry is also in great need of accessible craftsmen that quickly can fix errors. The problem is that most craftsmen today are occupied in the new construction projects, it creates longer lead times for the process. The craftsmen must also be suitable for a job in the aftermarket. The way of handling the issues in the industry are not uniform and are often outdated. Therefore a need exists for a modern and computerized case management system, it would improve the situation for both staff and customers. Companies can also use an evaluation system to rate their partners on how they acted during the warranty period. The information can be valuable for future collaborations. Knowing that a classification is performed can also increase the corporate accountability. Contracts in the future can be added a clause to encourage responsibility for the work during the <b>warranty</b> period. The <b>clause</b> requires a meeting where the contractors, among other things, can agree on a case management system to use. But most important is {{to pay attention to the}} work during the warranty period, which must be improved...|$|R
