5|$|Although it <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>short</b> by Roosevelt's {{desire to}} have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph.

5|$|In 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly), {{his novel}} Dzieci (Children), {{depicting}} the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists {{of the day}} — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, Przemiany (Changes), was to have been, like The Doll, a panorama of society and its vital concerns.
