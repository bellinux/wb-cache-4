5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} {{concerned}} that Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became concerned that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1984 he {{produced}} designs for director Jeremy Kagan who <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to adapt René Barjavel's novel La Nuit des temps (The Ice People).

30|$|Only {{once all}} of the result moves of the {{operation}} are scheduled, with or without bypasses, the algorithm attempts to schedule input operand moves as well. In case the schedule of operand moves fails, the result moves are unscheduled and a reschedule <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> with only early bypassing enabled. If the scheduling of operands still fails, result moves are unscheduled again and a reschedule <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> with only late bypassing enabled. Once again, if the schedule of operands still fails, scheduled moves are unscheduled and a reschedule <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> without any bypassing enabled. Only if all previous attempts fail, the starting cycle of the scheduling is decreased and a reschedule <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Bomis began {{a search}} for experts to vet Nupedia articles, this proved tedious. In August 2000 Nupedia had more than 60 {{academics}} contributing to the peer-review process on the site, most with doctor of philosophy or doctor of medicine degrees. Scholars wishing to contribute to Nupedia were required to submit their credentials via fax for verification. At that time, Bomis <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to obtain advertising revenue for Nupedia and the company was optimistic that it could fund the project with ad space on Nupedia.com.|$|E
5|$|As {{with almost}} every event that he entered {{in at the}} 2008 Summer Olympics, Michael Phelps was the {{favorite}} to win the men's 100 metre butterfly. Since winning the {{gold medal at the}} previous Games, in Athens, Phelps had demonstrated his superiority in this event, by also becoming world champion at the Melbourne 2007 World Championships, and achieving victory at the United States Olympic Trials. Therefore, the 100 metre butterfly was one of the eight Olympic events where Phelps <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to win a gold medal.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as abbot Foliot became {{friendly}} with Aelred of Rievaulx, a writer and later saint, who dedicated a book of sermons to him.

5|$|Early {{difficulties}} with staff conditions and wages, {{which the company}} <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to simplify from the complex contracts arranged by LCBS, led to strike action by staff in February 1988. Performance levels on contracted routes were already below those expected by the local councils who had awarded LCNE the contracts, and by London Regional Transport. Following the strike three of the company's London contracts (routes 292, 298 and 313) were terminated and awarded to independents.|$|E
5|$|In October 1139, Talbot {{was once}} more in charge of Hereford and {{withstood}} an attack by Miles of Gloucester, at that time a supporter of King Stephen.

He was joined in his siege efforts by Miles of Gloucester, who had switched sides and was then supporting Matilda.|$|E
5|$|Most of Kartodikromo's fictional works {{took place}} in Bandung or Surabaya. He was an early Indonesian example of the social realist movement. Like most {{nationalist}} writers at the time, Kartodikromo preferred writing in Malay (the predecessor of modern Indonesian) rather than his native Javanese; however, he did write several pieces in Javanese. While the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to standardise Malay, Kartodikromo experimented with the language, using words, phrases, and scenes which {{had never before been}} used.|$|E

5|$|October 3, 1979: The Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado, an {{extremely}} destructive F4 tornado, {{one of the}} worst in Connecticut history, killed three and injured 500 in northern Hartford County. The tornado struck without warning, tearing through Bradley International Airport, destroying more than a dozen airplanes, and narrowly missing a Boeing 727 which <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to land. About 100 homes were completely leveled. Most of the $200+ million in damage was done in Windsor Locks and Suffield. This was the sixth-most damaging tornado in US history.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1962, a bomb {{disposal}} officer was killed at Lympne when the pipe mine he <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> to make safe exploded. The Army temporarily suspended their {{bomb disposal}} operations as a result. Skyways supplemented their Dakotas with an Avro 748 (G-ARMV) which operated its first revenue-earning flight on 17 April 1962. In July, {{it was reported that}} Skyways had extended the passenger terminal at Lympne. In November, Skyways was taken over by Euravia, excluding Skyways Coach-Air which remained a separate company.|$|E

This ultimately resulted in a Samoan strap match at Extreme Rules, which was won by Punk.|$|E
50|$|IA-BF - The Impairment Aware Best Fit (IA-BF) {{algorithm}} {{was proposed}} in. This algorithm is a distributed approach that is dependent upon {{a large amount of}} communication to use global information to always pick the shortest available path and wavelength. This is accomplished through the use of serial multi-probing. The shortest available path and wavelength <b>are</b> <b>attempted</b> first, and upon failure, the second shortest available path and wavelength <b>are</b> <b>attempted.</b> This process continues until a successful path and wavelength have been found or all wavelengths have <b>been</b> <b>attempted.</b>|$|R
50|$|Integrated Windows Authentication {{itself is}} not a {{standard}} or an authentication protocol. When IWA is selected as an option of a program (e.g. within the Directory Security tab of the IIS site properties dialog) this implies that underlying security mechanisms {{should be used in}} a preferential order. If the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target, and any associated settings permit Kerberos authentication to occur (e.g. Intranet sites settings in Internet Explorer), the Kerberos 5 protocol will <b>be</b> <b>attempted.</b> Otherwise NTLMSSP authentication <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b> Similarly, if Kerberos authentication <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> yet it fails, then NTLMSSP <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b> IWA uses SPNEGO to allow initiators and acceptors to negotiate either Kerberos or NTLMSSP. Third party utilities have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to UNIX, Linux and Mac systems.|$|R
