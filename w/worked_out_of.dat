5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{his home and}} studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran {{on a shoestring}} budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their {{money to pay the}} bills. The company did not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies before moving to the more profitable British home computer market.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Noel Lee wanted {{to improve the}} sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't have very much money, so Lee experimented with ways to create a better sound by {{improving}} inexpensive cabling. At first he <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee experimented with different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find {{an alternative to the}} zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. He compared different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} observations {{had been}} taken by the N2K program using the Magellan Telescopes' Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph (MIKE) at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile since 2004. Based on these observations, the stars HD 154672 and HD 205739 were among those flagged as potential planetary host stars. The two stars were identified originally as having short-orbit hot Jupiter planets, but 3.5 years of additional observations revealed that the planetary candidates' orbits were far longer than initially anticipated. HD 154672 b's discovery {{was reported in the}} Astronomical Journal by the American Astronomical Society, appearing in the journal on October 7, 2008 alongside the planet HD 205739 b. The two planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K program that <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Magellan telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for a reading list for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, in Chicago's {{municipal}} elections, Vrdolyak, rather than seeking re-election as alderman, was the Solidarity Party's candidate challenging Washington for mayor. Washington won re-election, and Washington allies won twenty-five City Council seats. Burke led opposition in the City Council, but Washington supporter Alderman Timothy C. Evans replaced Burke as Chairman of the Committee on Finance. Ousted from the spacious Finance Committee staff offices, Burke never used the relatively modest office allocated to him in City Hall and instead <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his private law office two blocks away. In the days {{following the death of}} Mayor Washington in office, Burke supported the Council's selection of Alderman Eugene Sawyer over Evans to serve as mayor. Sawyer prevailed, but Burke was the alderman who least often voted in support of the legislative agenda of Mayor Sawyer, Chicago's second black mayor. After Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in {{the spring of}} 1989, Daley nominated Burke as Finance chairman, a position he has held ever since.|$|E

Carrey has conducted studies into psychological resilience, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. He has worked in the field of adolescent psychiatry at IWK Health Centre. Lynn Suess assisted Persinger in 1980, in researching geological phenomena which may have affected unidentified flying object sightings in Washington.

5|$|Writing first {{appeared}} in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories. Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300BC. Later Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents, love poetry and tales, {{as well as in}} Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of Harkhuf and Weni. The genre known as Sebayt ("instructions") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the Ipuwer papyrus, a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval, is a famous example.|$|E
