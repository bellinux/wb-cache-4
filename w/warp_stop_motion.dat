5000|$|The {{development}} of a workable <b>warp</b> <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> by {{other members of the}} Draper organization and marketing of the first Northrop looms in 1894 the textile industry achieved new levels of production. By 1900, Draper had sold over 60,000 Northrop looms, They were shipping 1500 a month, were employing 2500 men and enlarging their works to increase that output.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Northrop {{invented a}} self-threading shuttle and shuttle spring jaws {{to hold a}} bobbin by means of rings on the butt. This paved {{the way to his}} filling-changing battery of 1891, the basic feature of the Northrop loom. Northrop was {{responsible}} for several hundred weaving related patents. Other members of the Draper organization had developed a workable <b>warp</b> <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> which was also included. The first Northrop looms were marketed in 1894. Northrop retired to California two years later when he was 42.|$|E
40|$|The {{tension in}} the warp yarns is a {{critical}} variable in the weaving process. If the warp tension is too high or too low the weaving process will be interrupted. A parameter that directly affects the warp tension is the vertical <b>warp</b> <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> position. The position of the <b>warp</b> <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> must be set for every produced new article. The setting procedure is performed completely manual. In this paper we present a mechatronic modification of an air jet-weaving machine to adjust the vertical <b>warp</b> <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> position {{with the help of}} actuators. The parameters for the automated movement are determined and an open loop control, which uses a PLC, is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Owing to spandex silks {{are very}} thin and transparent, {{it is very}} hard to spot the broken warp without alarm during sewing or weaving.

50|$|Cartwright added {{parts to}} his loom, namely a {{positive}} let-off <b>motion,</b> <b>warp</b> and weft <b>stop</b> <b>motions,</b> and sizing the warp while the loom was in action. He commenced to manufacture fabrics in Doncaster using these looms, and discovered {{many of their}} shortcomings. He attempted to remedy these {{in a number of}} ways: by introducing a crank and eccentric wheels to actuate its batten differentially, by improving the dicking mechanism, by means of a device for stopping the loom when a shuttle failed to enter a shuttle box, by preventing a shuttle from rebounding when in a box, and by stretching the cloth with temples that acted automatically. His mill was repossessed by creditors in 1793.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> {{has very}} rarely {{been shot in}} {{stereoscopic}} 3D throughout film history.

5000|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> (hyphenated stop-motion {{when used}} as an adjective) is an {{animation}} technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence. Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> for their ease of repositioning. <b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation using plasticine is called clay animation or [...] "clay-mation". Not all <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> requires figures or models; many <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. <b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> can also use sequential drawing {{in a similar manner}} to traditional animation, such as a flip book. <b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> using objects is sometimes referred to as pixilation or object animation.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> {{animation}} has a {{long history}} in film. It was often used to show objects moving as if by magic. The first instance of the <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> technique can be credited to Albert E. Smith and J. Stuart Blackton for Vitagraph's The Humpty Dumpty Circus (1897), in which a toy circus of acrobats and animals comes to life. In 1902, the film Fun in a Bakery Shop used the stop trick technique in the [...] "lightning sculpting" [...] sequence. French trick film maestro Georges Méliès used <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation once to produce moving title-card letters in one of his short films, and a number of his special effects are based on <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> photography. In 1907, The Haunted Hotel is a new <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> film by J. Stuart Blackton, and was a resounding success when released. Segundo de Chomón (1871-1929), from Spain, released El Hotel Eléctrico later that same year, and used similar techniques as the Blackton film. In 1908, A Sculptor's Welsh Rarebit Nightmare was released, as was The Sculptor's Nightmare, a film by Billy Bitzer. Italian animator Roméo Bossetti impressed audiences with his object animation tour-de-force, The Automatic Moving Company in 1912. The great European <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> pioneer was Wladyslaw Starewicz (1892-1965), who animated The Beautiful Lukanida (1910), The Battle of the Stag Beetles (1910), The Ant and the Grasshopper (1911).|$|R
