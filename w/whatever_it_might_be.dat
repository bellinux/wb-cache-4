25|$|Shilts {{declined}} to be told {{the results of his}} HIV test until he had completed the writing of And the Band Played On, concerned that the test result, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> would interfere with his objectivity as a writer. He was finally found to be HIV positive in March 1987. Although he took the anti-HIV drug AZT for several years, he did not publicly disclose his AIDS diagnosis until shortly before he died.|$|E
500|$|Republicans {{claimed that}} Taylor's suit, {{by virtue of}} having been filed two hours before Beckham's, gave the case {{precedence}} in Louisville. By mutual consent, the parties consolidated the suits, which were heard before Judge Emmet Field in Jefferson County circuit court. Both sides knew that Field's decision, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> would be appealed, but both agreed {{to abide by the}} outcome of the final court's decision. The case was heard on March 1 and 2, 1900. Taylor's attorney's contended that the General Assembly had acted in a quasi-judicial manner, violating the principle of separation of powers. Further, because the contest committee's report did not specify how many votes were invalid, Republicans argued that all 150,000 votes cast in the contested counties had been invalidated by the General Assembly's vote, and consequently, the voters of those counties had been illegally disenfranchised. The most the Assembly {{should have been able to}} do, they claimed, was to invalidate the entire election. Finally, they contended that the alleged illegal activities of the General Assembly had deprived Taylor and Marshall of their property rights – the [...] "property" [...] in question being the offices they claimed – and their liberty to hold an elected office. Attorneys for Beckham contended that legislative actions historically had not been subject to judicial review, and indeed were not subject to such under any provision of the state constitution.|$|E
2500|$|I soon {{got used}} to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one {{happened}} to strike up, and the pulling, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> {{did not seem to}} be getting forward very well, the mate would always say, [...] "Come, men, can't any of you sing? Sing now, and raise the dead." [...] And then some one of them would begin, and if every man's arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope.|$|E
6000|$|Their purpose, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> {{was arrested}} for a moment by Bunks {{suddenly}} shouting {{at the top of}} his lungs-- ...|$|R
60|$|Hodder's reply, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> was {{prevented}} {{by the sudden}} and unceremonious flight of both occupants toward {{the ceiling of the}} limousine, caused by a deep pit in the asphalt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is jealousy nothing?" [...] said Rebecca. [...] "He {{makes me}} miserable about you. And <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> once--my heart is all his. I am {{innocent}} now. Am I not, Mr. Sedley?" ...|$|R
60|$|Clement stood {{blank and}} open mouthed, and Fulbert laughed, secure that the joke, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> was against him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Foolish lads!" [...] ejaculated Captain Dan with a smile, and an {{expression}} that proved he took some interest in the folly, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And in thine eye a {{kindling}} light [...] (<b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be)</b> [...] Was all on Earth my aching sight [...] Of Loveliness could see.|$|E
60|$|Here Dan spoke so {{low that}} he could not be heard at all, save only by his companion; but that is of little consequence, for the plan, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> was never carried out.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{respect for}} the crown in a truly loyal subject, sir," [...] Mr. Green {{returned}} sharply, [...] "is not to be unsettled by the sea; not in my case, at least, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> in your own." ...|$|R
60|$|The biggest {{kind of a}} feast, or powwow, or council, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> called, was in progress, and {{so deeply}} {{interested}} were the Britishers, Tories, and Indians alike that I believe of a verity we could have approached within fifty feet and not been discovered save by purest accident.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything that's {{worth having}} is some trouble," [...] said Anne, {{secretly}} resolving to forgive Davy's next offence, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> {{since he had}} avenged her on Ginger.|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "but the happening, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> {{would be}} our misfortune, and not theirs, and so we ought to bear the loss of it." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} alone in their room Alan told Jeekie of the {{expected}} entertainment of crystal gazing, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> and the part {{that he was to}} play in it.|$|E
60|$|Joe was {{so intent}} upon the lithe {{forms of the}} Indians that he barely {{got a glimpse of}} their {{floating}} prize, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been.</b> Bringing up the rear was an athletic warrior, whose broad shoulders, sinewy arms, and shaved, polished head Joe remembered well. It was the Shawnee chief, Silvertip.|$|R
60|$|Billy Byrne {{saw them}} {{from where he}} worked in the {{vicinity}} of the cabin. When they were not looking he scowled maliciously at them. They were the personal representatives of authority, and Billy hated authority in <b>whatever</b> guise <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> visited upon him. He hated law and order and discipline.|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} now advance many steps, without spying eyes {{to track and}} {{denounce}} him. Her own helplessness struck her with the terrible sense of utter disappointment. The possibility of being the slightest use to her husband had become almost NIL, and her only hope rested in being allowed to share his fate, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> ultimately <b>be.</b>|$|R
60|$|The hurricane, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> called, had by {{this time}} spent itself. The rain ceased and before the lake town came into view the sun shone once more as brightly as ever.|$|E
60|$|We went {{round to}} the end of the structure, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> and {{presently}} came to another. Again we went on and came to another, all of them being berthed exactly in line.|$|E
60|$|For a {{while there}} was silence. There they stood {{and stared at the}} smitten man waiting the end, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> They all stared save Murgh, who fixed his stony eyes upon the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well. I {{suppose he}} was {{inclined}} {{for a little}} sight-seeing {{like the rest of}} us." [...] Cartlett's interest in Jude <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> when Arabella was new to him, had plainly flagged since her charms and her idiosyncrasies, her supernumerary hair-coils, and her optional dimples, were becoming as a tale that is told.|$|R
60|$|Guided by the {{directions}} Mr. Harrison had given me, I had no difficulty in making my {{way in the}} direction of Chris Holtzmann's place of business or house, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> prove to <b>be.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Certain {{sounds from}} without {{revealed}} that the town was in festivity, though little of the festival, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> could be seen here. Bells began to ring, and the notes {{came into the room}} through the open window, and travelled round Jude's head in a hum. They made her restless, and at last she said to herself: [...] "Why ever doesn't Father come!" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Rowly {{felt that}} {{something}} was going on before her which she could not understand. Anything of this man's saying which she could not fathom must be at least dangerous; so she determined to spoil his purpose, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We did," [...] said Mr. Furlong, [...] "at {{a more or}} less nominal sum--four hundred {{thousand}} or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> We felt that for such a purpose, almost sacred as it were, one would want as little bargaining as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How--a priest? Didn't I {{tell you}} that no chattel of the Church, no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my Man-Factory? Didn't I {{tell you that}} you couldn't enter unless your religion, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> was your own free property?" ...|$|E
60|$|Paul {{was moved}} {{in spite of}} himself by the vehemence of his companion's words. The horrors of that deathbed scene at Cruta had never grown dim to him. He had always felt that his father had only decided to keep {{something}} back from him in those last moments, after a bitter struggle; and he was now quite sure that <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> the secret had been confided to this priest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{examined}} it yet," [...] I answered, and {{then and there}} proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome looking. There {{was no sign of}} disease, but the edges were white and worn looking, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred to me that that this wound, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the means of that manifest loss of blood. But I abandoned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.|$|R
60|$|<b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> in detail, so {{much was}} proved against {{him that he}} was {{dismissed}} his ship, and his father was recommended to withdraw him from the service, as being disqualified by want of nerve. Also, it was added more privately, that such vicious tendencies needed home restraint. The big bully, his corrupter, bore witness against him, but did not escape scot free, for one of the captains spoke to him in scathing tones of censure.|$|R
60|$|It {{was plain}} {{that she had}} been leading the way to the {{delivery}} of that message, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> in all that she had said up to the present time. So far my poor powers of penetration helped me, and no further.|$|E
60|$|Ned could {{scarcely}} help smiling to himself, {{at the thought}} of the many benefits which the Portuguese had bestowed upon these unfortunate islanders, whom they had reduced from a state of happy freedom to one which, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> called, was but little short of slavery.|$|E
60|$|Guy {{wrote to}} Charles in the fulness of his heart, expressing {{gratitude}} for his confidence and sympathy. He again begged for the supposed {{evidence of his}} misconduct, declaring he could explain it, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> and proceeded to utter deep regrets for his hasty expressions.|$|E
6000|$|... "No certain idea, sir," [...] Robert replied doubtfully. [...] "Now I come {{to think}} of it, though, it seemed as though he had come to make Mr. Palliser some sort of an offer. After I had let him out, he came back and said {{something}} to Mr. Palliser about three thousand pounds, and Mr. Palliser said he would let him know. I got the idea, somehow or other, that the transaction, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> was to be concluded on Tuesday night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Woodhouse had {{scrambled}} {{from the}} seat to his feet. He was trembling violently and in a perspiration with the suddenness of the occurrence. Was the thing, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> was, inside or out? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> big, <b>whatever</b> else <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> Something shot across the skylight, and the telescope swayed. He started violently and put his arm up. It was in the observatory, then, with him. It was clinging to the roof apparently. What the devil was it? Could it see him? ...|$|R
60|$|Above the nocturnal diapason of the teeming jungle {{sounded a}} dismal {{flapping}} of wings and over head, {{through the thick}} night, a shadowy form passed across the diffused light of the flaring camp-fire. Sinclair raised his rifle and fired. An eerie wail floated down from above and the apparition, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been,</b> was swallowed by the darkness. For several seconds the listening men {{heard the sound of}} those dismally flapping wings lessening in the distance until they could no longer be heard.|$|R
