40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of tool rotation speed and feed rate on the forming limit of friction stir welded Al 6061 -T 651 sheets has been investigated. The forming limit curve was evaluated by limit dome height test performed on all the friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets.</b> The <b>welding</b> trials were conducted at a tool rotation speed of 1300 and 1400 r/min and feed rate of 90 and 100 mm/min. A third trial of welding was performed at a rotational speed of 1500 r/min and feed rate 120 mm/min. It is found that with increase in the tool rotation speed, from 1300 to 1400 r/min, for a constant feed rate, the forming limit of friction stir welded blank has improved and with increase in feed rate, from 90 to 100 mm/min, for a constant tool rotation speed, it has decreased. The forming limit of friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> is better than unwelded sheets. The thickness gradient after forming is severe {{in the cases of}} friction stir welded blanks made at higher feed rate and lower rotation speed. The strain hardening exponent of weld (n) increases with increase in tool rotation speed and it decreases with increase in feed rate. It has been demonstrated that the change in the forming limit of friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> with respect to welding parameters is due to the thickness distribution severity and strain hardening exponent of the weld region during forming. There is not much variation in the dome height among the friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> tested. When compared with unwelded sheets, dome height of friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> is higher in near-plane-strain condition, but it is lesser in stretching strain paths...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, the {{influence}} of shoulder diameter, traverse speed, and rotational speed on the formability of friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> made between sheets of AA 6061 T 6 and AA 5052 H 32 Al alloys has been studied. In-Plane Plane-Strain formability tests are conducted for this purpose. It is understood from the results that the formability of <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> can be improved by optimizing the welding and tool parameters. A larger shoulder diameter, higher traverse speed, and lower rotational speed are favorable for improved formability, and strain hardening exponent of weld region. This {{is due to the}} fact that the heat input and subsequent microstructure evolved depends on the heat input, which depends on the welding parameters...|$|R

To this purpose, sheets with dip or hump were machined and welded by either changing the rotational speed or the tool plunging {{in order to}} keep constant the vertical force occurring during welding. The mechanical strength of the joints was measured in the zones where the <b>sheets</b> before <b>welding</b> were characterised by different thicknesses. The <b>sheets</b> <b>welded</b> by the two different strategies are characterized by very similar ultimate tensile strength values.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} on the mechanical and microstructural properties of dissimilar 2024 and 7075 aluminium sheets joined by friction stir welding (FSW).

The fatigue endurance (S–N) curves of the welded joints have been achieved, since the fatigue behaviour of light <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> is the best performance indicator for a large part of industrial applications; a resonant electro-mechanical testing machine load and a constant load ratio RZsmin/smaxZ 0. 1 have been used at a load frequency of about 75 Hz.

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} work is to analyze the {{influence}} of shoulder diameter and plunge depth on the formability of friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets.</b> The base material used for welding and forming was AA 6061 -T 6. Formability evaluation was performed through limiting dome height tests. The forming limit curve, FLC (only in the stretching region), thickness distribution, and strain hardening exponent of the weld region were monitored during formability studies. It is found from the work that the forming limit of friction stir <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> is better than unwelded sheets. In general, {{with an increase in}} shoulder diameter and plunge depth, the forming limit is found to improve considerably. With a decrease in thickness gradient severity and an increase in strain hardening exponent (n) of the weld region, the forming limit is found to increase. The increase in n value of the weld region is believed to occur because of the reduction in dislocation density. The maximum thickness difference is higher in the retreating side, rather than in the advancing side, of the weld. This is due to the differential straining and hardness levels attained by both sides during friction stir welding...|$|R

30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{result that}} could be concluded from Fig.  6 is that in low rotational speed (lower than the optimum rotational speed or 1570  rpm), impact strength (and also tensile strength in Fig.  4) will decrease with increasing traverse speed. But at high rotational speed (higher than 1570  rpm), this behavior could not be seen. In other words, at higher rotational speeds, traverse speed of 42  mm/min could be chosen as optimum traverse speed in which the mechanical properties of <b>welded</b> <b>sheets</b> could be maximized.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} work is to analyze the {{influence}} of external weld flash on the formability of friction stir <b>welding</b> <b>sheets</b> through in-plane plane-strain formability tests. The load-extension behavior and forming limit strains are measured to quantify the formability. The influence of friction stir welding parameters on the height of weld flash was also studied. The base materials used for welding trials are AA 6061 T 6 and AA 5052 H 32 alloy sheets of 2. 1 -mm thickness. It is observed that the influence of external weld flash on the maximum load and total extension for all the friction stir welding conditions is negligible. The effect of weld flash on the limiting major strain is also insignificant. But the presence of weld flash has changed the limiting minor strain, more toward plane-strain condition, indicating the change in strain-path toward plane-strain. This {{is due to the}} strain taken by weld flash, along with the major strain, minor strain, and thickness strain in the friction stir <b>welding</b> <b>sheet</b> plane because of constancy of volume. The formation of weld flash and its height are affected synergistically by the axial force and temperature development during friction stir welding. The higher the axial force and temperature, the higher the flash height...|$|R
