40|$|While Wiskott-Aldrich {{syndrome}} protein (<b>WASP)</b> plays critical {{roles in}} TCR signaling as an adaptor molecule, how it transduces innate immune signals {{remains to be}} elucidated. To investigate the roles of <b>WASP</b> in innate immune cells, we established bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cell lines from <b>WASP</b> 15 transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing the <b>WASP</b> N-terminal region (exons 1 – 5). Upon LPS stimulation, <b>WASP</b> 15 Tg BMDM cell lines produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL- 6, and IL- 12 p 40 than the wild-type BMDM cell line. In addition, the production of nitric oxide by <b>WASP</b> 15 Tg BMDM cells in response to LPS and IFN-c was significantly impaired. Furthermore, we uncovered that the <b>WASP</b> N-terminal domain associates with the Src homology (SH) 3 domain of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk). Overexpression of the <b>WASP</b> N-terminal domain diminishes the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous <b>WASP</b> in <b>WASP</b> 15 Tg BMDM cells, possibly by interfering with the specific binding between endogenous <b>WASP</b> and Btk during LPS signaling.

5|$|The {{interaction}} between figs and fig <b>wasps</b> is especially well-known (see section on reproduction, above). In {{addition to its}} pollinators (Pegoscapus mexicanus), F. aurea is exploited {{by a group of}} non-pollinating chalcidoid <b>wasps</b> whose larvae develop in its figs. These include gallers, inquilines and kleptoparasites as well as parasitoids of both the pollinating and non-pollinating <b>wasps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adult solitary <b>wasps</b> mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter <b>wasps</b> (Eumeninae) and sand <b>wasps</b> (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other Ficus species, the {{community}} of <b>wasps</b> inside the figs of F. rubiginosa is made up mostly of pollinator <b>wasps.</b> These develop deep inside the syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the fig. At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis—are common while others are rare. Investigation of F. rubiginosa syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic <b>wasps</b> develop closer {{to the wall of}} the syconium. The <b>wasps</b> of the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis are parasitic and are around {{the same size as the}} pollinator species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the pollinator wasp. Male Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis <b>wasps</b> fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a F. rubiginosa fig. Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other <b>wasps</b> and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of pollinator <b>wasps</b> in the fig later. An example of this is Pseudidarnes minerva, a metallic green wasp species.|$|E

5|$|Government {{agencies}} {{in both the}} USA and Canada have utilized a native species of parasitoid wasp, Cerceris fumipennis, {{as a means of}} detecting areas to which emerald ash borer has spread. The females of these <b>wasps</b> hunt other jewel beetles and emerald ash borer if it is present. The <b>wasps</b> stun the beetles and carry them back to their burrows in the ground where they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the beetles. Volunteers catch the <b>wasps</b> as they return to their burrows carrying the beetles to determine whether emerald ash borer is present.

5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} an insect host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are <b>wasps</b> or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid <b>wasps,</b> which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid <b>wasps,</b> which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid <b>wasps,</b> which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E
50|$|Host-parasite {{interactions}} are prime examples of evolutionary arms races. The host evolves methods of detecting the parasite, and the parasite counters by evolving methods of evasion. It {{has been reported}} in some specialized Chrysis species that the cuckoo <b>wasp</b> chemically camouflages itself when infiltrating the nest of its host. Field observations indicate that the cuckoo <b>wasp</b> is only attacked when the host <b>wasp</b> visually recognizes it. If the cuckoo <b>wasp</b> can make it into the nest in the dark, research has shown that it can disguise itself chemically by secreting saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons to match the scent profile of the host <b>wasp.</b> In these situations, even when the host <b>wasp</b> encounters the cuckoo <b>wasp</b> head on in the dark, the cuckoo <b>wasp</b> remains undetected.|$|R

5|$|Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies {{compared}} to certain other eusocial <b>wasps</b> species. Thus, {{it is common}} for the nest to be destroyed, for the queen to die prior {{to the end of the}} season, or for the nest to fail through other means, such as predation, parasitisation, or worker mortality, leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister <b>wasps.</b> Due to this, it would be advantageous for there to be <b>wasps</b> that remain casteless till adulthood, allowing female wasps’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic. It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker <b>wasps</b> would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present, exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity. Experimentally, this has been found to be true. Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had the eggs and larvae removed. In the experimental group, the <b>wasps</b> began to behave like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens. In the control group, the <b>wasps</b> continued to behave as workers. This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity.|$|E
5|$|Social <b>wasps</b> are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the <b>wasps</b> sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the <b>wasps</b> may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|Some social <b>wasps</b> are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male <b>wasps</b> {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some <b>wasps,</b> such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E

40|$|Involvement of the Wiskott-Aldrich {{syndrome}} protein (<b>WASp)</b> {{in promoting}} cell activation requires its release from autoinhibitory structural constraints {{and has been}} attributed to <b>WASp</b> association with activated cdc 42. Here, however, we show that T cell development and T cell receptor (TCR) -induced proliferation and actin polymerization proceed normally in WASp�/ � mice expressing a <b>WASp</b> transgene lacking the cdc 42 binding domain. By contrast, mutation of tyrosine residue Y 291, identified here as the major site of TCR-induced <b>WASp</b> tyrosine phosphorylation, abrogated induction of <b>WASp</b> tyrosine phosphorylation and its effector activities, including nuclear factor of activated T cell transcriptional activity, actin polymerization, and immunological synapse formation. TCR-induced <b>WASp</b> tyrosine phosphorylation was also disrupted in T cells lacking Fyn, a kinase shown here to bind, colocalize with, and phosphorylate <b>WASp.</b> By contrast, <b>WASp</b> was tyrosine dephosphorylated by protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) -PEST, a tyrosine phosphatase shown here to interact with <b>WASp</b> via proline, serine, threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PSTPIP) 1 binding. Although Fyn enhanced WASpmediated Arp 2 / 3 activation and was required for synapse formation, PTP-PEST combined with PSTPIP 1 inhibited WASp-driven actin polymerization and synapse formation. These observations identify key roles for Fyn and PTP-PEST in regulating <b>WASp</b> and imply that inducible <b>WASp</b> tyrosine phosphorylation can occur independently of cdc 42 binding, but unlike the cdc 42 interaction, is absolutely required for <b>WASp</b> contributions to T cell activation.

5|$|The most {{commonly}} known <b>wasps,</b> such as yellowjackets and hornets, {{are in the}} family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Many of the solitary <b>wasps</b> are parasitoidal, meaning that they raise their young by laying eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult).
