5|$|On 22 May 1816, a {{group of}} 56{{residents}} met at The Globe Inn in Littleport to discuss the lack of work and rising grain costs. Fuelled by alcohol, the residents directed their anger at local farmer Henry Martin. He had been overseer of the poor in 1814 and was not well liked by the parishioners. One man <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a horn from Burgess, the lighterman, and started blowing it outside The Globe Inn, gathering hundreds of villagers to join the first group, and the riot commenced.|$|E

25|$|The Williamses {{pulled away}} from the McLarens who were pulling away from the Ferraris (Prost had by now passed Alesi). On lap 18, Patrese waved Mansell through and decided to follow him. The McLarens stopped first and Senna got ahead of Berger. When Mansell stopped on lap 29, his crew had trouble fixing the wheelnut of his right rear properly. As the Williams {{mechanic}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a spare nut, the lollipop man, unaware of the trouble signalled for Mansell to depart. Immediately, his right rear fell off and he stopped {{in the middle of the}} pitlane. The team retrieved the tyre, fixed it on Mansell's car and sent him on his way but he had dropped to 17th.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of her disappearance, Moore and a friend had driven into New York City, for a night of {{clubbing}} and drinking. Moore was underage at the time.

Moore's friend later moved the car, but it was ticketed while the girls were inside the club and finally towed to the West 38th Street impound lot. When Moore and her friend <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the vehicle at the impound lot, the attendants refused to surrender it.

Richards dragged Taylor under some of the straw {{mattress}} to put pressure on his wounds and slow the bleeding and then <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help. Both Richards and Taylor survived. Taylor eventually became the third president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Richards had escaped all harm except for a bullet grazing his ear.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{evidence}} entered against her was from events that had happened {{five or ten years}} previous. Phillip and Sarah Nelson testified that Robert Shilleto (by then deceased, so he could not affirm or deny the story) had repeatedly complained that Margaret was a witch, afflicting him until he died. Jonathan Burbank, Captain Daniel Wycomb and Frances Wycomb testified that Margaret had come to Burbank's house, asking for corn from his field. (By this time, she had long been widowed.) Burbank initially asked her to wait until he retrieved it from his field, but when she persisted, his wife gave her some. Later, when he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some more corn out of the field, his oxen refused to move, which he attributed to Margaret's bewitching of them. Similarly, Thomas Nelson testified that Margaret repeatedly came to him for wood, for payment of a debt he owed to her. After he denied her, two of his cows died, which he and his neighbors considered unnatural, causing him to conclude Margaret was a witch.|$|E
500|$|In Frankfurt she met {{and married}} a white German man named Alexander.

When she and Alexander <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their marriage license, the registrar greeted Alexander, wrote down his name, and then asked [...] "Where is the bride?" [...] As they were descending the courthouse steps after their wedding, a passerby offered wedding congratulations to the maid of honor. She ignored the incidents even though [...] "I am troubled by this continual need {{to point out to}} others that it is I who am getting married." [...] After six years she and Alexander divorced.|$|E
500|$|Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, {{a friend}} of the Cowboys, later testified that he woke up about 1:30pm [...] after the late-night card game, and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a shave at a barbershop. That's where he first learned that the Cowboys were armed. Behan stated he quickly {{finished}} his shave and went to locate the Cowboys. At about 2:30pm he found Frank McLaury holding a horse and talking to someone on Fourth Street near the corner of Fremont. When he saw Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury near C. S. Fly's photography studio, he walked there with Frank. He told the Cowboys that they must give up their arms. Ike Clanton said he was not armed, and Tom McLaury pulled his coat open to show he was not carrying a weapon.|$|E

[...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E

He fell backwards while standing on stage with other est participants, during {{a part of the}} training known as [...] "the danger process" [...] or [...] "fear confront", which had started at approximately 11:30 P.M. that night. During this process, Slee was supposed to confront his fear of {{standing in front of a}} group of individuals. An est graduate whose role was called a [...] "body catcher" [...] or [...] "people catcher" [...] broke Slee's fall and then <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help.

500|$|Throughout {{his life}} Mendelssohn was {{wary of the}} more radical musical {{developments}} undertaken by some of his contemporaries. He was generally on friendly, if sometimes somewhat cool, terms with Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, and Giacomo Meyerbeer, but in his letters expresses his frank disapproval of their works, for example writing of Liszt that his compositions were [...] "inferior to his playing, and [...] only calculated for virtuosos"; of Berlioz's overture Les francs-juges [...] "the orchestration is such a frightful muddle that one ought to wash one's hands after handling one of his scores"; and of Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable [...] "I consider it ignoble", calling its villain Bertram [...] "a poor devil". When his friend the composer Ferdinand Hiller suggested in conversation to Mendelssohn that he looked rather like Meyerbeer– they were actually distant cousins, both descendants of Rabbi Moses Isserlis– Mendelssohn was so upset that he immediately <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a haircut to differentiate himself.|$|E
