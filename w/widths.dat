40|$|Abstract—This is {{the first}} paper to discuss the ON-state drain–current of a special {{thin-film}} transistor structure with a wide channel <b>width</b> and a narrow source/drain <b>width</b> in the linear region. The experimental results indicate that when the channel <b>width</b> is wider than the source/drain <b>width,</b> the side-channel current effect is generated. This effect increases the ON-state drain–current due to the additional current-flow paths exist-ing in the side-channel regions and low channel resistance. As the side-channel <b>width</b> increases, the ON-state drain–current ini-tially increases and then gradually becomes independent of the side-channel <b>width</b> when the side-channel <b>width</b> {{is larger than the}} effective side-channel <b>width,</b> which depends on the channel <b>width</b> and is largely independent of the source/drain <b>width.</b> This paper also demonstrates that the ON-state drain–current gain is directly proportional to the channel length and the ratio of the channel length to the source/drain <b>width</b> and dependent on the side-channel <b>width.</b> Index Terms—Drain–current, poly-Si thin-film transistor (TFT), source/drain <b>width,</b> wide channel <b>width.</b> I...|$|R
