5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E

5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> animals and environments beyond his property rights theory.

He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E

5|$|The exact line {{of descent}} between {{domestic}} sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear. The most common hypothesis states that Ovis aries is descended from the Asiatic (O. orientalis) species of mouflon. It has been proposed that the European mouflon (O. musimon) is an ancient breed of domestic sheep turned feral rather than an ancestor, despite its commonly being cited as ancestor in past literature. A few breeds of sheep, such as the Castlemilk Moorit from Scotland, were formed through crossbreeding <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> European mouflon.|$|E

Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island.

5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E

5|$|The Ujung Kulon {{peninsula}} of Java {{was devastated}} by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. The Javan rhinoceros recolonized the peninsula after the event, but humans never returned in large numbers, thus creating a haven for wildlife. In 1931, as the Javan rhinoceros {{was on the brink}} of extinction in Sumatra, the government of the Dutch East Indies declared the rhino a legally protected species, which it has remained ever since. A census of the rhinos in Ujung Kulon was first conducted in 1967; only 25 animals were recorded. By 1980, that population had doubled, and has remained steady, at about 50, ever since. Although the rhinos in Ujung Kulon have no natural predators, they have to compete for scarce resources <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> cattle, which may keep their numbers below the peninsula's carrying capacity. Ujung Kulon is managed by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry. Evidence of at least four baby rhinos was discovered in 2006, the most ever documented for the species.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} for a {{flexible}} theatre complex, where up to ten areas are available for performance. Tom Morris has cited as inspiration the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. The main auditorium gained an optional thrust stage, {{and an increase in}} seating to 540. The Side Stage area was redeveloped, with additional capacity of 250, creating the option of a separate second auditorium. Other spaces redeveloped as performance areas included the Paint Shop and the rehearsal room. The Theatre Royal re-opened in September 2012, <b>with</b> <b>Wild</b> Oats. Further work (mainly {{in the area of the}} foyer) is planned for the refurbishment's next phase, to be completed in 2016, to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the theatre opening.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the film}} was set in Istanbul, Turkey. Locations {{included}} the Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia and the Sirkeci railway station which also {{was used for the}} Belgrade and Zagreb railway stations. The MI6 office in London, SPECTRE Island, the Venice hotel and the interior scenes of the Orient Express were filmed at Pinewood Studios with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey and the truck ride were shot in Argyll, Scotland and Switzerland. The end scenes for the film were shot in Venice. However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent {{of the film}} had to have been filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth. The Gypsy camp was also to be filmed in an actual camp in Topkapi, but was actually shot in a replica of it in Pinewood. The scene with rats (after the theft of the Lektor) was shot in Spain, as Britain did not allow filming <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> rats, and an attempt filming white rats painted in cocoa in Turkey did not work. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963, and wrapped on 23 August. Ian Fleming spent a week in the Istanbul shoot, supervising production and touring the city with the producers.|$|E
