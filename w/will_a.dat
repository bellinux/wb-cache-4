5|$|The final {{consideration}} is cost: how much <b>will</b> <b>a</b> particular defensive strategy cost {{a plant in}} energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection outweigh the costs, specifically in situations where there is high herbivore pressure.|$|E

5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the <b>will.</b> <b>A</b> happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free <b>will,</b> <b>a</b> view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his <b>will.</b> <b>A</b> Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Fragments of Him {{is based}} on {{the life and death of}} <b>Will,</b> <b>a</b> man who dies early in the game. The player controls four characters throughout the game; Will, his ex-girlfriend, his boyfriend at the time when he died, and his grandmother. As the game progresses, it becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also on those of the other characters, and how they cope with his death. The game relies heavily on its narrative which, although the player controls the game in the first-person, is described by the developer as being viewed in a second-person perspective, i.e. where the player is not directly controlling a character but instead indicates what the characters should interact with next.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} noble {{democracy}} became more firmly rooted {{during the first}} interregnum, {{after the death of}} Sigismund II Augustus, who following the Union of Lublin wanted to reassert his personal power, rather than become an executor of szlachta's <b>will.</b> <b>A</b> lack of agreement concerning the method and timing of the election of his successor was one of the casualties of the situation, and the conflict strengthened the Senate-magnate camp. After the monarch's 1572 death, to protect its common interests, szlachta moved to establish territorial confederations (kapturs) as provincial governments, through which public order was protected and basic court system provided. The magnates were able to push through their candidacy for the interrex or regent to hold the office until a new king is sworn, in the person of the primate, Jakub Uchański. The Senate took over the election preparations. The establishment's proposition of universal szlachta participation (rather than election by the Sejm) appeared at that time to be the right idea to most szlachta factions; in reality, during this first as well as subsequent elections, the magnates subordinated and directed, especially the poorer of szlachta.|$|E

5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, and very often <b>will</b> <b>a</b> warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free to move into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster was {{released}} {{as a collection}} for the PlayStation 3 and as separate releases of each game for the PlayStation Vita. Alongside the standard PlayStation Vita releases in Japan, there was a Twin Pack that bundled both games and a Resolution Box collection which additionally contained the handheld console. A dual release was decided against for the Vita versions due to the limited storage capacity of the cartridges. Play Arts Kai figurines of Tidus and Yuna were produced and the original soundtracks were re-released. Two new Ultimania guide books were published for each game. Nojima wrote the tie-in novel Final Fantasy X-2.5: Eien no Daishō that bridges the gap between Last Mission and Final Fantasy X: <b>Will.</b> <b>A</b> Collector's Edition of the PlayStation 3 version was exclusively released in North America via Square Enix's online store. It contained both games, an artwork book, a Blu-ray disc for the rearranged soundtrack and five artwork lithographs. A special launch event was held at Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra, California during March 2014. It included a signing event with Kitase and Naora, and an artwork auction with all profits going {{to the victims of}} Typhoon Haiyan. The PlayStation 4 port of the remaster, officially announced at a PlayStation conference in China on December 11, 2014, was originally leaked in Square Enix France's online store earlier that same day. The PS4 release supports save transfers from the PS3 and Vita versions, remote play on the Vita, switching between the original and remastered soundtracks and further enhanced graphics now in full HD (1080p) with non-player NPCs and monsters receiving further treatment. It {{was released}} worldwide on PS4 in May 2015. It was later released on Microsoft Windows via Steam in May 2016 with an auto-save feature, 5 game boosters, 3 parameter changes, 4K resolution support, graphic and audio settings and the option to skip FMVs.|$|E
