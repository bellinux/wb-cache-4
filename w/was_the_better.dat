Benchley took this offer to Vanity Fair {{to see if they}} would match it, as he felt Vanity Fair <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> magazine, and Vanity Fair offered him the position of managing editor. He accepted and began work there in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In July 1780, 5,000 veteran French troops {{led by the}} comte de Rochambeau {{arrived at}} Newport, Rhode Island {{to aid in the}} war. French naval forces then landed, led by Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse. At first Washington hoped to bring the allied fight to New York and to end the war there, but Rochambeau advised de Grasse that Cornwallis in Virginia <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> target. Admiral de Grasse {{followed}} this advice and arrived off the Virginia coast. Washington immediately saw the advantage created, made a feinting move with his force towards Clinton in New York, and then headed south to Virginia.|$|E

5|$|After VVKJ acceptance, a {{group of}} pilots {{conducted}} 16 mock dogfights between the IK-2 and the Hawker Fury I biplane already in service with the VVKJ, during which the IK-2 displayed overall superiority over the British-built aircraft. At one point, Bajdak declared his continuing doubts about the aircraft, and Dobnikar challenged him to a duel, with Bajdak flying his preferred aircraft, the Fury I. After Dobnikar won the climbing competition and a race to Zemun and back from Belgrade, the final dogfight forced Bajdak to concede that the IK-2 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> aircraft. On 20 November 1937, the VVKJ submitted a proposal to order a batch of 12 IK-2s, which was approved the following month. The production version included some additional improvements, but continued testing resulted in further delays, with the aircraft not entering service for another year. By this time, international consensus had coalesced around {{the superiority of the}} low-wing monoplane, and the IK-2 was already obsolescent {{by the time it was}} delivered to VVKJ fighter units.|$|E

There he realized that Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, president of the Fusion Party, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> option to help in this task. While in Spain, Muñoz Rivera received notice that his father had died, which heavily affected him. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he published an article about his father in La Democracia. He subsequently noticed that his travel had caused controversy within the Autonomist Party, which became divided between followers of Barbosa and Muñoz Rivera, with the two factions becoming known as Muñocistas and Barbosistas.|$|E
5|$|The third contest was a tag team match, {{in which}} The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) faced the APA (Bradshaw and Faarooq). At one point, Bradshaw {{performed}} a Clothesline from Hell on Haas. Benjamin then delivered a superkick to Bradshaw and pinned him {{to gain the}} win for his team. After the match, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his seat by arena security. In the ring, General Manager Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring segment on how SmackDown! <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> program over Raw. Lesnar would {{come down to the}} ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. As part of the storyline, Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring, where Lesnar performed a spear on Goldberg however he recuperated and delivered a Jackhammer to Lesnar. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric Flair in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where Michaels challenged Flair to a singles match for later during the show, which Flair accepted. As the match {{was about to take}} place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the Flair versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood instead of on the broadcast of Raw. Later on that episode, Flair and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after Flair cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following Monday on an episode of Raw, Michaels and Flair were in a promotional in-ring segment, where they both discussed who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> wrestler. Later during the program, Michaels, along with Kevin Nash and The Hurricane defeated Evolution. The feud between Flair and Michaels enhanced on the June 9, 2003 episode of Raw. During the show, Flair and Michaels managed Randy Orton and The Hurricane, respectively; after Orton defeated The Hurricane, Flair and Michaels were scripted to brawl until the program went into a commercial break.|$|E

25|$|The main {{figures in}} this debate were John Maynard Keynes from Cambridge and the LSE's Friedrich Hayek. The LSE Economist Lionel Robbins was also heavily involved. Starting off as a {{disagreement}} over whether demand management or deflation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomics. Keynes put forward the theories now known as Keynesian economics, involving the active participation {{of the state and}} public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the Austrian School, which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.|$|E
25|$|The Penang state {{government}} at the time under the then Chief Minister, Koh Tsu Koon attempted to revamp the state's ailing bus network. Under the revamped routes that were launched in 2006, bigger buses were made to run along trunk routes while minibuses ran feeder routes which branched off the trunk routes. The revamp, however, failed to improve the situation, leading the Penang {{state government}} to study the revamp already conducted in Kuala Lumpur and request for federal intervention. It was felt that bringing in Rapid KL, which already had the expertise and know-how, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> solution than simply purchasing more buses, although Rapid KL at the time chose to focus on its core operations in the Klang Valley.|$|E

He also officiated the Quarter Final match between Ireland and Wales, the semi-final between Australia and New Zealand and the final between New Zealand and France, in the process {{becoming}} the youngest referee ever to officiate a final. Joubert was publicly criticised by French players Dimitri Yachvili, Dimitri Szarzewski and Maxime Mermoz for his performance in the final. Gerry Thornley, writing in The Irish Times, was {{of the opinion that}} France <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> team on the night, with Joubert being reluctant to award penalties against New Zealand {{in the last quarter of}} the match.|$|E

The ŻOB {{had more}} than 750 fighters, but lacked weapons: they had only 9 rifles, 59 pistols and several grenades. A developed network of bunkers and fortifications were formed. The Jewish fighters also received support from the Polish Underground (Armia Krajowa). The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the ŻOB, Mordechai Anielewicz died fighting on May 8, 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.|$|E
25|$|Allenby {{returned}} to Britain in 1890 and he sat– and failed– the entry exam for the Staff College in Camberley. Not deterred, he sat the exam {{again the next}} year and passed. Captain Douglas Haig of the 7th Hussars also entered the Staff College at the same time, thus beginning a rivalry between the two that ran until the First World War. Allenby was more popular with fellow officers, even being made Master of the Draghounds in preference to Haig who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> rider; Allenby had already developed a passion for polo. Their contemporary James Edmonds later claimed that the staff at Staff College thought Allenby dull and stupid but were impressed by a speech that he gave to the Farmers' Dinner, which had in fact been written for him by Edmonds and another.|$|E
25|$|Somewhat later, Delgado's team mates {{got back}} to Delgado, and {{together}} they chased Roche, and caught him just before the climb of La Plagne. Roche then anticipated that Delgado would keep attacking on the climb. Knowing Delgado <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> climber, Roche decided he would not follow Delgado's attack. Instead, he let Delgado get away until the margin was one minute, giving Delgado {{the impression that he}} could safely save energy for the next stages, and at {{the last part of the}} stage gave it everything he had to reduce the margin. Roche followed that tactic, and confused not only Delgado, but also the commentators and the Tour organisation. Roche finished a few seconds behind Delgado, and after the finish he collapsed and was given an oxygen mask in an ambulance.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August, Feyenoord was {{eliminated}} by Dynamo Kyiv {{in the third}} qualifying round of the Champions League following losses in both legs. Feyenoord was therefore demoted to the play-off round of the UEFA Europa League. Koeman said that Feyenoord <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> side over the two legs but had missed a scoring striker, referring to John Guidetti, who had rejoined Manchester City {{following the end of}} his loan. On 10 August 2012, Dutch international and Málaga defender Joris Mathijsen joined Feyenoord on a three-year contract. Málaga had made clear to Mathijsen that he needed to find a new club to generate income for the financially-suffering Málaga after Sheikh Al Thani left. Stefan de Vrij remained captain, despite Mathijsen being more experienced at both international and club level.|$|E
25|$|In 1143, while {{preparing}} to conquer Crusader Antioch, John II died following a hunting accident in Cilicia. John Axouch {{was instrumental in}} gaining control of Constantinople for John's chosen successor, his younger surviving son Manuel I Komnenos, against the possible candidacies of his elder brother and uncle, both named Isaac. Leaving Manuel and the army in Cilicia, Axouch travelled rapidly and reached Constantinople before news of John's death; once in the capital he secured control of the imperial treasuries and regalia, and the persons of the two princes, whom he confined to the Pantokrator Monastery. Manuel's accession therefore suffered from no active opposition. Axouch was faithful to the wishes of John II, although he is recorded as having tried hard to persuade the dying emperor that his elder surviving son Isaac <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> candidate to succeed.|$|E
25|$|Luigi - An Italian badger who {{travelled}} from Italy {{and stayed}} at Bodger and Badger's flat during Series 7 (the puppet design {{for this was}} very similar to Badger's). He had several arguments with Badger over which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> food - spaghetti or mashed potato. At first Bodger {{did not know about}} Luigi's presence. After he found out about Luigi, Bodger allowed him to stay at the flat a while. Luigi only appeared in one episode. This meant use was made of the programme's requirement to have more than one Badger puppet at a time, should one get damaged in a stunt and be out of action for some time being repaired. A small blue trilby hat was wedged over the spare puppet's red beret and the clothes were changed (as all the Badger puppets were designed to be).|$|E
