5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} its apparent magnitude. It {{is a function of the}} star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is what the apparent magnitude a star <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} given above produce {{dates in}} radiocarbon years: i.e. dates {{that represent the}} age the sample <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> the / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, {{it was not until}} discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.|$|E
5|$|After Homer sees how devastated Apu {{was about}} being deported, he changes {{his mind about}} the {{immigration}} proposition and vows {{that he and his}} family will help Apu. Lisa discovers that Apu will not have to leave if he can pass a United States citizenship test. Homer agrees to be Apu's tutor to help prepare for the exam. After Lisa intervenes, Apu goes to take the test; he passes and becomes a citizen of the United States. At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests how terrible it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> immigrants were deported, explaining they make the United States thrive. He inspires them to vote no on Proposition 24, but it still passes, with 95% of voters voting yes. After the ballot is passed, the only person deported is Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E

5|$|Portrayed by Kristin Kreuk, Lana Lang {{is one of}} Clark Kent's {{friends and}} on-again-off-again girlfriend. In the first season, Lana and Clark's {{friendship}} is just beginning, as she is dating Whitney Fordman during this time. After Whitney leaves for the Marines in the season one finale, Lana and Clark slowly begin to try to start a romantic relationship. In season seven, Lana leaves Smallville, leaving behind a DVD explaining to Clark that, even though she loves him, {{the only way for}} him to help the world to the best of his ability <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> she left him and Smallville for good.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway. This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient than it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although {{a wide variety of}} metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E

5000|$|Asked by Samuel French, Inc. if {{he could}} name the playwright who had most {{influenced}} him, Heinze said, [...] "If I <b>were</b> darker, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Orton. <b>If</b> I <b>were</b> more laconic, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Pinter. <b>If</b> I <b>were</b> more lyrically erudite, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Stoppard. <b>If</b> I had ten additional brains, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Shakespeare. Hm. Everyone seems to <b>be</b> English. <b>If</b> I <b>were</b> more Irish, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Beckett. (And <b>if</b> I had more savoir faire, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Molière.)" [...] He added, [...] "I think all my sources of inspiration are unconventional. It's the feeling of something unconventional that {{makes me want to}} write the play. At least for a full-length play that’s true. I think I wouldn't want to invest the time if I didn’t have that feeling." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

An {{example of}} amplification <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if,</b> {{with the land}} masses around 65° north covered in year-round ice, solar energy were reflected away.
