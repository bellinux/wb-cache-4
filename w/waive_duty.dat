5000|$|Batista {{encouraged}} large-scale {{gambling in}} Havana. In 1955, {{he announced that}} Cuba would grant a gaming license to anyone who invested US$1 million in a hotel or $200,000 in a new nightclub—and {{that the government would}} provide matching public funds for construction, a 10-year tax exemption, and <b>waive</b> <b>duties</b> on imported equipment and furnishings for new hotels. Each casino would pay the government $250,000 for the license, plus a percentage of the profits. The policy omitted background checks, as required for casino operations in the United States, which opened the door for casino investors with illegally obtained funds. Cuban contractors with the right connections made windfalls by importing, duty-free, more materials than needed for new hotels and selling the surplus to others. It was rumored that, besides the $250,000 to obtain a license, an additional [...] "under the table" [...] fee was sometimes required.|$|R
40|$|This Note {{examines}} {{a largely}} unexplored consequence of jurisdictions adopting a default duty to mitigate for commercial leases: whether a contract provision <b>waiving</b> the <b>duty</b> should be enforced. Only a few courts {{across the country}} have addressed the waiver issue in a commercial setting. At least two different appeals courts have enforced a waiver clause and claim that public policy supports their decision. In contrast, a federal court has stated the opposite—that public policy demands waiver provisions be void. Another state has outright voided all waiver clauses by statute. Courts that have enforced waivers have asserted that commercial parties have equal bargaining power and that these parties are free to enter into whatever agreements they wish. This Note argues that courts should not enforce clauses purporting to <b>waive</b> the <b>duty</b> to mitigate, because waivers are against public policy and there is no guaranteed equal bargaining power between commercial landlords and tenants. Finally, this Note proposes that states should adopt a blanket rule outright voiding all waiver clauses...|$|R

50|$|Between 1803 and 1930, ad hoc {{legislation}} was passed more than 100 times for relief or compensation after a disaster. Examples include the <b>waiving</b> of <b>duties</b> and tariffs to the merchants of New York City after the Great Fire of New York (1835). After {{the collapse of}} the John T. Ford's Theater in June 1893, the 54th Congress passed legislation compensating those who were injured in the building.|$|R
25|$|In 1634, the Mughal emperor {{extended}} his hospitality to the English traders {{to the region}} of Bengal, and in 1717 completely <b>waived</b> customs <b>duties</b> for their trade. The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, indigo dye, saltpetre, and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the Straits of Malacca by ousting the Portuguese in 1640–41. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R

40|$|In corporations, {{like most}} other {{business}} associations, fiduciary duties exist to deter management from abusing their power over the owners’ property. In Delaware limited partnerships and limited liability companies, this protection can be waived in the operating agreement. This Note explores the effects of retaining or <b>waiving</b> fiduciary <b>duties</b> and how this plays out {{in the interpretation of}} operating agreements. It argues that default fiduciary duties exist for limited liability companies and limited partnerships, including those that are member managed, and it proposes a combination of disclosure and signature requirements from each limited partner or member in order for waiver of fiduciary duties to be effective...|$|R
25|$|A special {{committee}} {{was formed to}} oversee reconstruction efforts, while government officials began considering new laws to enact stricter building codes. The government pledged to help eligible homeowners rebuild and repair their property. On October 6, Prime Minister of the Bahamas Perry Christie signed an order <b>waiving</b> import <b>duties</b> on materials needed for rebuilding by storm victims and registered charities on 12 islands. Local leaders called for {{an extension of the}} three-month exemption period, which many saw as inadequate. In what residents feared to be a major economic setback, storm-related damage forced Club Med to delay the annual opening of its San Salvador resort—the largest employer on the island—by two months. At the end of October, the National Emergency Management Agency began to shift its focus from emergency relief distribution to permanent rebuilding efforts.|$|R

40|$|Duty {{drawback}} (or rebate) systems, {{reduce or}} eliminate the duties paid on imported intermediate goods, or raw materials used {{in the production of}} exports. When a firm imports an intermediate product for use in the production of an export good, tariff payments on the imported intermediate good are either <b>waived</b> (<b>duty</b> drawback), or returned to the producer once the final product is exported (rebate). These incentive systems are often justified {{on the grounds that they}} tend to correct the anti-trade bias imposed by high tariff levels. The problem with this line of reasoning is that it assumes that tariffs are predetermined policy variables; if they were, the easiest way to reduce their anti 0 trade bias would be to eliminate them. But this is rarely done because existing levels of protection correspond to a political economy equilibrium, difficult to modify in the presence of lobbying pressures. The authors show that in a political economy setting, where tariffs and duty drawbacks are endogenously chosen through industry lobbying, full duty drawbacks are granted to exporters that use imported intermediate goods in their production. This in turn decreases their incentives to counter-lobby against high tariffs on their inputs. Indeed, under a full duty drawback regime, tariffs on intermediate goods are irrelevant to exporters, because they are fully rebated. In equilibrium, higher tariffs will be observed on these goods. Creating a regional trading block, alters the incentives by eliminating duty drawbacks on intra-regional exports, which leads to lower tariffs for goods that intra-regional exporters use as inputs. Evidence from MERCOSUR suggests that eliminating duty drawbacks for intra-regional exports, would lead to increased counter-lobbying against protection of intermediate products. The authors estimate that without this mechanism, the common external tariff would have been 3. 5 percentage points (25 percent) higher on average.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{managers}} of U. S. firms with {{operations in the}} Caribbean region evaluated the attractiveness of twenty host country incentives. Multivariate {{analysis of variance was}} employed to determine whether incentive preferences were a function of investment characteristics. The results indicate that incentive preferences depend on the type of investment, market orientation, size of investment, geographic location, year of invest-ment, and type of product. Furthermore, exporters considered import duty concessions to be more desirable than did investors oriented toward the local markets. These results indicate that government programs <b>waiving</b> import <b>duties,</b> such as the free trade zones of the Dominican Republic and the maquiladora program of northern Mexico, are providing the incentive deemed most important by their targeted investors. In order to attract foreign direct investment, many developing countries have offered various investment incentives. The competition among countries seeking investment has led to a proliferation of the types of incentives provided to foreign investors. Potential investors are now faced with a dizzying array of host government incentives. In fact, one study identified fifty-one different types of incentives given by developing countries t...|$|R

Even though the army <b>waived</b> her husband's <b>duty,</b> she was sent to train at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, where {{she was the only}} Mexican-American woman on the base. After her training, she was sent to Bergstrom Air Field. There were two other women, both non-Hispanic, at Bergstrom Air Field, and several more in Big Spring, all working in the sheet metal department. At Big Spring, she was the only woman working in the hangar. She worked as a mechanic between from 1942 to 1944.|$|R
25|$|Partly due to low {{awareness}} {{among the}} general population and prohibitive equipment costs, the number of licensed amateur radio operators did not increase significantly {{over the next two}} decades, numbering fewer than a thousand by 1970. CW (Morse code) and AM were the predominant modes at that time. The electronic equipment was mostly valve-based, obtained from Indian army surpluses. During the mid-1960s, the modes of operation saw a change from Amplitude Modulation to Single Side Band (SSB) as the preferred communication mode. By 1980, the number of amateur radio operators had risen to 1,500. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, <b>waived</b> the import <b>duty</b> for wireless equipment. After this, the number of operators rose steadily, and by 2000 there were 10,000 licensed ham operators. As of 2007, there are more than 17,000 licensed users in India.|$|R
25|$|Amateur {{radio or}} ham radio is practised {{by more than}} 16,000 {{licensed}} users in India. The first amateur radio operator was licensed in 1921, and by the mid-1930s, there were around 20 amateur radio operators in India. Amateur radio operators played {{an important part in}} the Indian independence movement with the establishment of illegal pro-independence radio stations in the 1940s. The three decades after India's independence saw only slow growth in the numbers of operators until the then Prime Minister of India and amateur radio operator, Rajiv Gandhi (VU2RG), <b>waived</b> the import <b>duty</b> on wireless equipment in 1984. Since then, numbers have picked up, and , there were more than 16,000 operators in the country. Amateur radio operators have played a vital role during disasters and national emergencies such as earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, floods, and bomb blasts, by providing voluntary emergency communications in the affected areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{installed}} capacity of natural gas-based {{power plants and}} the ready to be commissioned with the commencement of natural gas supply is nearly 26,765 MW {{at the end of}} financial year 2014-15. These base load power plants are operating at overall PLF of 25% only due to severe shortage of Natural gas in the country. Imported LNG was too costly for the power generation. Many of these power stations are shut down throughout the year for lack of natural gas supply. Natural gas shortage for power sector alone is nearly 100 MMSCMD. The break even price for switching from imported coal to LNG in electricity generation is estimated near 6 US$/mmBtu. Indian government has taken steps to enhance the generation from the stranded gas based power plants for meeting peak load demand by <b>waiving</b> applicable import <b>duties</b> and taxes due to drastic fall in the LNG and crude oil international prices.|$|R
