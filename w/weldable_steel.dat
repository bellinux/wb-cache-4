Various kinds of loads wereapplied, i. e. monotonically increasing static, constant, and cyclic. Appropriate measures of hydrogen degradationwere chosen and analyzed. Mechanisms of hydrogen degradation were detected and established on the basis ofscanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of fracture samples surface. Findings: Tested high strength steels and their welded joints are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement whenevaluated using a slow strain rate test (SSRT). On contrary, these steels and welded joints have high resistance tohydrogen delayed cracking under a constant load test. Significant reduction of a fatigue life time due to hydrogenabsorption has been observed during severe low-cycle fatigue tests.

40|$|The tubular {{welded joints}} {{used in the}} {{construction}} of Offshore structures can experience millions of variable amplitude wave induced stress cycles during their operational life. Fatigue has been identified as the main cause of degradation of structural integrity in these structures. As a result, fatigue is an important consideration in their design. Jack-up legs are made from a range of high strength steels with yield strengths up to 70 OMPa. These steels are thought to exhibit fatigue resistance properties which are different when compared with conventional fixed platform steels such as BS 4360 50 D and BS 7191 355 D. The difference in their behaviour was heightened by the discovery, in the late 80 s and early 90 s, of extensive cracking around the spud can regions of several Jack-ups operating in the North Sea. It was thought that these steels may be more susceptible to hydrogen cracking and embrittlement. There was the additional requirement to study their behaviour under realistic loading conditions typical of the North Sea environment. This thesis contains results of an investigation undertaken to assess the performance of a typical high strength <b>weldable</b> Jack-up <b>steel</b> under realistic loading and environmental conditions.

40|$|Reinforcing {{steel in}} {{concrete}} {{has been used}} for many years in roads, bridges and other structures to give strength and durability; concrete has only good compressive strength and reinforcing steel gives the tensile strength to the concrete to sustain both the compressive and tensile load, making concrete structures {{to be used in the}} common as well as critical areas. Reinforcing steel that was used in structures predominantly is mild steel, which is considerably cheaper than stainless steel, and more susceptible to corrosion leading to the damage of the structures and less longevity. To solve the problem with the use of mild steel in critical areas, such as bridges; stainless steel is used; which has iron as the main constituents along with the chromium as the major alloying element and various grades are manufactured varying the compositions of steel. To reduce the cost of the stainless steel, some compositions like chromium, molybdenum, nickel are varied; especially the nickel is being replaced by manganese, the cost of which is significantly less than that of nickel. The alternative grades of the reinforcing steel that were used for testing the corrosion resistance are mild <b>steel</b> (400), <b>weldable</b> mild <b>steel</b> (400 W) and four stainless steel 316 LN, UNS 24100 (Enduramet 32), 2304, LDX 2101; among them 316 LN and UNS 24100 are the austenitic steels (Valbruna) and 2304 and LDX 2101 are duplex steels (Outokumpu). The austenitic steels have no ferritic phase which is making austenitic steel more corrosion resistance than the duplex steels which have almost equal parts of the ferritic and austenitic phases. Concrete that is used commonly as the shield for the reinforcing steel providing the environment to passivate the reinforcement. Concrete has the pH of ~ 13. 5 which is the equivalent to the pH of the pore solution. Its strength and curing time varies due to the water cement ratio and composition and also the environment in which it is placed. Good quality concrete has less permeability and fewer cracks thereby limiting the ingress of the de-icing slats to the reinforcing steel and delaying the onset of corrosion. Corrosion of the reinforcing steels was tested in concrete using both an accelerated exposure test and ASTM A 955 M standard for cracked prisms to measure the corrosion rate and open circuit potential, which are quantitative measurement for corrosion. It is hoped that the results will provide a guide for the future use of the alternative grades of the reinforcing steel to be used in the concrete. Reinforcing mild steels were compared to determine if there is any advantage in using the more carefully controlled 400 W welding grade, rather than the 400 grade. The service life of structures with the 400 grade of steel is well established and so the data from the 400 grade also provided a relative measure of corrosion resistance for the alternative grades of the stainless steel. Microcell corrosion of the reinforcing steel was monitored by the use of the linear polarization and the corrosion potential. The data for show that there is no significant corrosion on any of the stainless steels after 15 months of measurement, whereas both the mild steels embedded in the concrete corroded fully as confirmed by visual observation of the beams after autopsying The autopsied samples were then analysed for chloride content in the concrete adjacent to the reinforcing bars. This was accomplished by titration. The chloride content on the beams with 400 and 400 W grades was found to be higher than the beams with the stainless steels, where the percentage of chloride remained almost the same. Macrocell corrosion tests were performed on the ASTM A 955 M cracked prisms and showed changes in corrosion current density in agreement with the accelerated corrosion current density of the stainless steels. The only difference was observed in the corrosion potentials of the 400 and 400 W steels, which were more negative in the cracked prisms than in the beams. In summary, all the stainless steels showed evident corrosion resistance both in accelerated and ASTM A 955 M prisms tests and no sign of corrosion was found in the stainless steels after 400 days in beams and 200 days in prisms.

40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} tests {{have been carried}} out in a number of gaseous environments in order to assess their effects on the crack {{propagation}} resistance of BS 4360 grade 50 EE, a <b>weldable</b> structural <b>steel.</b> Crack growth rates at 25 °C are up to 20 times higher in hydrogen than in air, but there is no effect when hydrogen is present as a 30 % constituent of a simplified product gas (SPG). Indeed, crack growth rates in such a mixture are slightly lower than those measured in air, being comparable with those observed in an inert environment. The other gases present in the SPG are CO, CO 2 and CH 4, and it is probable that the carbon monoxide is responsible for nullifying the embrittling effects of hydrogen, by preferentially adsorbing on {{to the surface of the}} steel and thus blocking hydrogen entry. Experimental observations suggest that oxygen has the same effect when small quantities are allowed to diffuse into a non-flowing hydrogen environment around a propagating crack. The results are encouraging in terms of the suitability of conventional structural steels such as BS 4360 for gas plant applications. The gas mixtures present in such an environment would not have the severe detrimental effects on fatigue crack growth resistance which result from the presence of 'pure' hydrogen. © 1993...|$|R
40|$|Stainless {{steel is}} gaining {{increasing}} use in construction {{because of its}} durability, favorable mechanical properties, and aesthetic appearance, with the austenitic grades being the most commonly used. Austenitic stainless steels have a high nickel content (8 – 11 %), resulting in high initial material cost and significant price fluctuations; this, despite its desirable properties, represents a considerable disadvantage in terms of material selection. Ferritic stainless steels, having no or very low nickel content, may offer a more viable alternative for structural applications, reducing both the level and variability of the initial material cost while maintaining adequate corrosion resistance. There is currently limited information available on the structural performance {{of this type of}} stainless steel. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, a series of material, cross section, and member tests have been performed, covering both the standard EN 1. 4003 grade (similar to the chromium <b>weldable</b> structural <b>steel</b> 3 Cr 12) and the EN 1. 4509 grade (441), which has improved weldability and corrosion resistance.

The as-quenched microstructure contained bainite/martensite laths and a small amount of retained austenite. The strength and toughness in this specimen was based on the small transformation product packets with their fine laths and highly dislocated substructures. The best combination of strength and toughness occurred for the sample tempered at 621 degC; the recovery of the dislocation substructures, the precipitation of overaged copper and carbides, and the small transformation product packet size accounted for the high toughness at this tempering temperature. The size, distribution, and composition of non-metallic inclusions were also determined; the inclusion population generally consisted of small, globular, homogeneously dispersed particles. However, exogenous oxides on the order of 50 um were occasionally found as well as slightly brittle oxides which had broken up in the rolling direction. As a result of this investigation, it is suggested that the optimum aging temperature for 31. 75 mm as-quenched HSLA- 100 plate is around 600 degC and that improved secondary steelmaking procedures are adopted to eliminate the large, deleterious non-metallic inclusions.

Hydrogen related problems in the weld fabrication stage or hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC) due to hydrogen embrittlement under cathodic protection have been reported and testing to better understand the behavior of these materials is of interest. The present work is focusing on the effect of double heat cycles on carbide precipitation and secondary hardening in two high grade SMSS, one alloyed with Ti and one not (0. 007 % Ti). The experimental work included heat treatment of both steels in single and double cycles in both oven and in induction heating weld simulator. All specimens were heated to 1000 degrees celsius for 30 min to austenize the material and air cooled before simulating second heat cycles of 1 - 60 min in the temperature range 500 - 600 degrees celsius. The microstructures resulting from the heat treatments were characterized by standard metallographic techniques, hardness testing and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results from hardness testing show a secondary hardening effect in both steels for all temperatures tested, with a maximum for samples treated at 550 degrees celsius. For all samples there was also a significant drop in hardness from the hardness of the single cycle sample to the 1 min tempered double cycle samples. From investigation in TEM it was found that, in the steel alloyed with titanium TiC precipitate during tempering and in the steel not alloyed with titanium Cr 23 C 6 precipitate during tempering at 550. The difference in secondary hardening found is explained by the difference in carbide precipitation mechanism. In the steel alloyed with titanium a higher secondary hardening effect was found.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is under increasing pressure from legislation on {{greenhouse gas emissions}} because cars {{are seen as a}} significant contributor to the atmospheric gases that accelerate global warming. Reducing the weight of automobiles is one way to help increase fuel economy and hence reduce quantities of harmful gases released into the atmosphere. Weight reduction in the body-in-white is one area that has received attention because it accounts for ~ 25 % of the total car mass. Using higher strength materials allows less material to be used to support the same forces. Steels have the merit of being economical, strong and exhibit excellent formability and recyclability, thus being the dominant material employed in vehicle construction. In the automotive manufacturing industry, hot stamping has recently come to the fore as a potential method for forming very high strength metals. New processing methods provide an opportunity to develop new steels and the goal of this project is to develop a new, <b>weldable</b> sheet <b>steel</b> with a yield strength approaching 2 GPa that could be formed by hot stamping. This steel should contain a low concentration of total alloying elements and a carbon content less than ~ 0. 03 wt. %. The approach chosen is based on precipitation hardening of alloy precipitates in a lath martensite matrix. The lath martensite matrix exhibits remarkable thermal stability and can contribute ~ 1 GPa to the yield strength. The objective is for precipitation hardening to contribute the extra 1 GPa without significant loss of strength of the matrix to reach a total yield strength of ~ 2 GPa. A genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed and coupled with a computational thermodynamic database to search through composition and temperature space to identify alloy systems and compositions that could potentially meet these design constraints. A new class of steels exploiting the G-phase were developed with yield strengths of 1700 MPa. Combined atom probe tomography (APT) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques allowed a detailed characterization of the precipitate state in these new alloys. In-situ SAXS experiments allowed a direct measurement of the nucleation rate of G-phase precipitates and the effective interfacial energy of the precipitate was extracted using classical homogeneous nucleation theory. The precipitate growth kinetics was closely parabolic, as expected for diffusion controlled growth of equiaxed precipitates, and the mass transfer coefficient of the rate controlling species, Ni, was obtained in the lath martensite matrix. Finally, using the theory for strengthening from shearable obstacles, the individual G-phase precipitate strength, as a function of precipitate size, was extracted. The particle strength was observed to depend linearly on size (as is usually assumed) but a deviation at particles radii below 15 Å was observed...|$|R
