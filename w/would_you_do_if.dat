500|$|Judgment {{refers to}} the patient's {{capacity}} to make sound, reasoned and responsible decisions. Traditionally, the MSE included the use of standard hypothetical questions such as [...] "what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> you found a stamped, addressed envelope lying in the street?"; however contemporary practice is to inquire about how the patient has responded or would respond to real-life challenges and contingencies. Assessment would {{take into account the}} individual's executive system capacity in terms of impulsiveness, social cognition, self-awareness and planning ability.|$|E
500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> your mother asked you?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Oz {{supported}} Israeli {{actions in}} Gaza during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, criticizing Hamas tactic of using human shields, saying: [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> your neighbor {{across the street}} {{sits down on the}} balcony, puts his little boy on his lap, and starts shooting machine-gun fire into your nursery? What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> your neighbor across the street digs a tunnel from his nursery to your nursery in order to blow up your home or in order to kidnap your family?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A young student {{once asked}} Bakhita: [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> {{you were to}} meet your captors?" [...] Without {{hesitation}} she responded: [...] "If I were to meet those who kidnapped me, and even those who tortured me, I would kneel and kiss their hands. For, if these things had not happened, I {{would not have been}} a Christian and a religious today".|$|E
2500|$|Ōe {{remembers his}} {{elementary}} school teacher claiming that Emperor Hirohito was a living god, and asking him every morning, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> the emperor commanded you to die?" [...] Ōe always replied, [...] "I would die, sir. I would cut open my belly and die." [...] At home {{in bed at night}} he would acknowledge his reluctance to die and feel ashamed. After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed. This sense of betrayal later appeared in his writing.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl {{reported}} to police that a boy called John had assaulted her by putting {{his hand over}} her mouth and saying: [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> I killed you? I have done it before." [...] This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for burglary and in interview cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was remanded in custody, and the Medical Officer of Horfield prison examined him, certifying that he was mentally retarded. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in Bristol under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, 27 October 1912, the 18-year-old Kiyoaki and Honda {{are talking}} {{on an island}} in the {{ornamental}} lake on the estate when they see Kiyoaki's mother, her maids, and two guests: Satoko Ayakura, the 20-year-old daughter of a count, and her great-aunt, the Abbess of Gesshu. The Ayakura family is one of twenty-eight of the rank of Urin, and they live in Azabu. Kiyoaki is aware that Satoko has a crush on him, and pretends indifference to her. Shortly after they all meet, there is a bad omen: they see a dead black dog {{at the top of a}} high waterfall. The Abbess offers to pray for it. Satoko insists on picking flowers for the dog with Kiyoaki. While Satoko is alone with Kiyoaki, she blurts out: [...] "Kiyo, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> all of a sudden I weren't here any more?" [...] He is discomfited by the inexplicable question, and resents the fact that she has startled him with it.|$|E
2500|$|After Liu Yao was {{defeated}} by Sun Ce subsequently in battle, Taishi Ci originally planned to accompany Liu Yao as he fled to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) for shelter. However, Taishi Ci went into hiding in the hills at Wuhu County (蕪湖縣; east of present-day Wuhu, Anhui) and declared himself the Administrator (太守) of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡). By then, Sun Ce had conquered the territories east of Xuancheng County (宣城縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui); only the six counties west of Jing County (涇縣; north of present-day Jing County, Anhui) remained outside of Sun Ce's control. Taishi Ci headed to Jing County, where he established a base and managed to recruit the Shanyue people to join him. Sun Ce personally led his forces to attack Taishi Ci, defeated him in battle, and captured him. Later, he released Taishi Ci from his bonds, held his hand and asked, [...] "Do you still remember our fight at Shen Village? What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> you captured me?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I can't be certain about this." [...] Sun Ce laughed and said, [...] "I shall manage the present-day affairs of the state together with you from this moment onwards." ...|$|E

2500|$|The ongoing of the {{election}} made third parties attract voters' attention. On March 3, 2016, Libertarian Gary Johnson addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington DC, touting himself as the third-party option for anti-Trump Republicans. In early May, some commentators opined that Johnson was moderate enough to pull votes away from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who were very disliked and polarizing. Both conservative and liberal media noted that Johnson could get votes from [...] "Never Trump" [...] Republicans and disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Johnson also began to get time on national television, being invited on ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Bloomberg, and many other networks. In September and October 2016, Johnson suffered a [...] "string of damaging stumbles when he has fielded questions about foreign affairs." [...] On September 8, Johnson, when he appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe, was asked by panelist Mike Barnicle, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> you were elected, about Aleppo?" [...] (referring to a war-torn city in Syria). Johnson responded, [...] "And what is Aleppo?" [...] Johnson's [...] "what is Aleppo?" [...] question prompted widespread attention, much of it negative. Later that day, Johnson {{said that he had}} [...] "blanked" [...] and that he did [...] "understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict – I talk about them every day." ...|$|E
