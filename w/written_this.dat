By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E

For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings.

25|$|The euphonium, {{like the}} tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B. For a valved brass {{instrument}} like the euphonium, {{this means that}} when no valves are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. It is generally orchestrated as a non-transposing instrument like the trombone, written at concert pitch in the bass clef with higher passages in the tenor clef. Treble clef euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much concert band music: in the British-style brass band tradition, euphonium music is always <b>written</b> <b>this</b> way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.|$|E
25|$|Also elegiac is the Piano Trio, {{written in}} memory of Nikolai Rubinstein—a point which {{accounts}} for the prominence of the piano part. The work is in two actual movements, the second a large set of variations including a fugue and a long summing-up variation serving as {{the equivalent of a}} third movement. Had Tchaikovsky <b>written</b> <b>this</b> work as a piano quartet or piano quintet, he would have availed himself of a string complement well able to play complete harmony and could therefore have been allotted autonomous sections to play. With only two stringed instruments, this option was not available. Instead, Tchaikovsky treats the violin and cello as melodic soloists, with the piano both conversing with them and providing harmonic support.|$|E

25|$|Accustomed {{to writing}} the scripts for movies, Gowariker {{said that he}} found it {{difficult}} to write the script for Everest. Typically, {{in the case of a}} soap opera, the story is not written entirely prior to release. Rather, it is written as the soap opera goes on, analysing various factors such as the TRPs (television rating points) and the audience feedback. Everest, however, was not <b>written</b> <b>this</b> way. Gowariker has also said that it was while writing the story that he realised the self-satisfaction that people get after climbing Mount Everest. After finishing writing the story, he realised not only that he wanted to produce the show, but also that he also needed experts to direct it. Gowariker said in a group interview that through Everest he would also be addressing the girl child issue.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, NetBank {{recognized}} {{that there were}} some significant operating deficiencies and started to restructure the company in an effort to resume profitability. The company shut down or sold several businesses. Some of the shuttered companies included FTI, payroll and finance services, non-auto (RV, boat and aircraft) loans and the subprime/non-conforming mortgage companies. The independent auditor, Ernst and Young, resigned in 2006. NetBank's mortgage operations suffered greatly. NetBank normally originated loans and resold the loans to other financial institutions on the open markets. Some of the loans that NetBank sold did not meet the underwriting guidelines and NetBank was forced to repurchase these loans from the other banks. Since the loans that did not meet the underwriting guidelines were often past-due loans, NetBank was forced to repurchase a many failed loans that it had <b>written.</b> <b>This</b> loss of capital was very harmful to the company's equity position and was the first clue to the bank's poor financial position.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Hill revived {{his musical}} version of The Phantom of the Opera. This time though, {{he wanted to}} add {{the kind of music}} that would have been heard at the Opéra Garnier in the late 19th century. Consequently, he {{discarded}} the modern score by Ian Armit and wrote original English lyrics that told Gaston Leroux’s tale. By placing them to opera arias by Gounod, Offenbach, Verdi, Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, and Boito, he created a musical that reflected the era in which the original novel was <b>written.</b> <b>This</b> updated version of The Phantom of the Opera was produced in a joint production by the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East, and premiered at the Newcastle Playhouse on 3 April 1984, before shortly moving to the Theatre Royal Stratford East. In between, the show had two very brief runs at the New Tyne Theatre in Newcastle and the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton - neither of those productions did very well. When the show got the Theatre Royal Stratford East, Sarah Brightman, who created the role of Christine in the Lloyd Webber version, was famously asked to perform the role of Christine in the 1984 cast but she turned it down, leaving the role for the opera singer Christina Collier.|$|E
