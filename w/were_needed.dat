He was told that, among those his age (32), only qualified personnel <b>were</b> <b>needed.</b> In 1941–42 he taught English at the University of Michigan. He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 1942–45.|$|E
5|$|After King John's death, however, St Briavels Castle {{became the}} primary centre for English quarrel manufacture. The {{crossbow}} {{was an important}} military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon {{by the time of}} Richard Imany crossbows and even more quarrels <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> to supply royal forces. Crossbows were primarily built at the Tower of London, but St Briavels Castle, with the local forest to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|After the Constitution of May 3, 1791, sejms {{were to be}} {{held every}} two years and last 70 days, with a {{provision}} for an extension to 100 days. Provisions for extraordinary sejms were made, {{as well as for}} a special constitutional sejm, which was to meet and discuss whether any revisions to the constitution <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> (that one was to deliberate every 25 years).|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} invasion threat passed, Sandown continued in military use into the 17th century. A 1616 survey nonetheless {{reported that a}} range of repairs <b>were</b> <b>needed,</b> at an estimated total cost of £437, while a 1634 survey noted that work estimated at £1,243 was required. In contrast, an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition, but antiquated in design. A report produced in 1641 suggested that £8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including £3,000 for additional sea defences.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level <b>were</b> <b>needed.</b> Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Before {{fighting}} had officially erupted, Santa Anna {{had realized}} that stronger measures <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> to ensure calm in Texas. He ordered his brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos to bring approximately 500soldiers to Texas. Cos {{and his men}} arrived in Goliad on October 2. Three days later, after learning of the events at Gonzales, the soldiers left for San Antonio de Béxar.|$|E

5|$|Both the St. Louis German and Irish {{communities}} urged neutrality at the 1914 {{outbreak of}} World War I, which {{contributed to a}} resurgent nativism after U.S. entry into the war in 1917. As a result, German St. Louisans suffered some discrimination during the war, and St. Louisans repressed elements of German culture. Commerce was not dramatically affected by the war. However, leading up to and before World War I, the population started to decrease as men <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> {{to work at the}} artillery plants and factories that were closer to the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} week of March, the {{battalion}} finally withdrew to refit with the M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyer. In so doing, it reverted to the old self-propelled battalion organisation; three companies of twelve tank destroyers, plus a fourth reconnaissance company with a platoon of pioneers. The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March, the 824th finished the month with a complement of 646 all ranks, down from 750.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{numbers of}} workers <b>were</b> <b>needed,</b> the Vichy regime imposed a {{compulsory}} labour system, drafting some 600,000 French workers to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian, and French coasts facing the English Channel. Efficiency of the OT decreased in late 1943 and 1944 {{as a result}} of manpower pressures, fuel shortages and the bombing of worksites, such as V-weapons sites, where some volunteer workers refused to work in such dangerous areas.|$|E
