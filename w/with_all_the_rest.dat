5|$|On June 27, 1955, the Howard Beach station, along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Rockaway Beach Branch {{stations}} {{south of}} the now defunct Ozone Park station, {{was taken out of}} service for eight months for restructuring and upgrading of the tracks, so that they could accommodate subway service. During the project, the Howard Beach station, along with the Broad Channel and Far Rockaway stations, was completely rebuilt utilizing a modern design, which included a new overhead passageway between the two platforms. The design was created by architect J. Harold Sandifer, a native of the Rockaways. Many of the parts for the station were prefabricated, speeding construction. On June 28, 1956, the station reopened as a subway station {{along with the rest of}} the line. The previous Long Island Rail Road station at this location was razed. Inauguration ceremonies were held at the station as well as at Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn.|$|E

He was more open to her about {{much of his life}} and his creative processes than to any other person. Her feedback became so important to him that, after the critics lambasted his Fifth Symphony, she provided him with the support to persevere with his composing. Von Meck died believing these letters had all been destroyed. However, when Tchaikovsky received her request to do so, he assured her that he had destroyed them, but then filed that letter <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> for posterity to find.|$|E

5000|$|Berlioz began [...] "by {{writing a}} solo for viola, but one which {{involved}} the orchestra {{in such a}} way as not to reduce the effectiveness of the orchestral contribution."

500|$|In 1916, minting {{of double}} eagles ceased, as bullion prices were rising because of World WarI, which also caused {{an influx of}} American gold coins from Europe. [...] Holders of gold coin, such as banks, refused to pay them out at par value, and they {{vanished}} from circulation. [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} war, [...] international demand for the coin was restored; many Europeans distrusted their local currencies and desired double eagles to hold. [...] The coin was struck in large numbers once coinage was resumed in 1920, but it was now almost exclusively a coin of international trade, or was held by banks as backing for gold certificates. [...] The coin itself rarely circulated in the United States. The onset of the Depression in 1929 did not halt the minting of double eagles, but the coins were for the most part held in Treasury vaults, and few were released. [...] Many of the great rarities of the Saint-Gaudens series stem from its final years. [...] Despite a mintage of almost 1.8million pieces of the 1929 double eagle, it is estimated that fewer than 2,000 exist today, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> melted by the government in the late 1930s.|$|E
