5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool,</b> and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E
25|$|There is {{absolutely}} no evidence that Gregory <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool,</b> and much {{to prove that he}} was intelligent and accomplished. Moreover, Gregory Cromwell was not created Baron Cromwell of Oakham by letters patent until December 1540 and did not receive any royal grants before February 1541. His courtesy title of Lord Cromwell was forfeited after his father's arrest, although he did continue to receive the profits from the property alienated to his use and his heirs by his father in November 1538. This property included the manors and lordships of Oakham and Langham (Rutland), Clapthorne, Hackleton and Piddington (Northamptonshire), and Blaston (Leicestershire), with the advowson of Blaston church, and the manors of North Elmham and Beetley (Norfolk). Gregory was still receiving the profits from Langham in April 1541, his entitlement was then being questioned and which was later resolved in his favour.|$|E

Lennon's reaction was, [...] "Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!" [...] He later wrote, [...] "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that." [...] In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record." [...] Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr [...] "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?" ...|$|E

500|$|In Britain, Gambier's conduct {{has been}} criticised by historians {{ever since the}} battle, such as William Laird Clowes, who wrote in 1901 that [...] "there can be no {{question}} that affair of Aix Road was mismanaged by the Admiralty at home and by the Admiral on the spot" [...] and that [...] "a great naval commander never loses an occasion to attack when conditions are favourable to him." [...] In 2007 historian Noel Mostert wrote [...] "Oh Nelson! Nelson, Nelson, where were you? Never could {{the absence of the}} man from a scene of action clearly designed for his drive and decision have been more painfully alive." [...] In the same year David Cordingly wrote that [...] "The boldness of the attack [...] [...] [...] was comparable with the exploits of a Drake, de Ruyter and Nelson. And yet the action at Basque Roads has come to be regarded as a wasted opportunity, a bungled and confused affair." [...] Perhaps the most damning response came from an enemy. Years later, Napoleon wrote to an English correspondent that Cochrane [...] "could not only have destroyed , [...] [...] [...] but he might and would have taken them out, had your admiral supported him as he ought to have done [...] [...] [...] The French admiral <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> , but yours was just as bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haxey and Westwoodside lie {{in an area}} of North Lincolnshire {{known as}} the Isle of Axholme. The {{official}} story is that in the 14th century, Lady de Mowbray, wife of an Isle landowner, John De Mowbray, was out riding towards Westwoodside on the hill that separates it from Haxey. As she went over the hill her silk riding hood was blown away by the wind. Thirteen farm workers in the field rushed to help and chased the hood all over the field. It was finally caught by one of the farm workers, but being too shy to hand it back to the lady, he gave it to one of the others to hand back to her. She thanked the farm worker who had returned the hood and said that he had acted like a Lord, whereas the worker who had actually caught the hood <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Fool.</b> So amused was she by this act of chivalry and the resulting chase, that she donated 13 acres (53,000m²) of land on condition that the chase for the hood would be re-enacted each year. This re-enactment over the centuries has become known as [...] "The Haxey Hood" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1939, Halder oversaw {{development}} of the invasion plans of France, the Low Countries, and the Balkans. In late 1939-early 1940, Halder was an opponent of Operation Weserübung, which he believed was doomed to failure, and made certain that the OKH {{had nothing to do}} with the planning for Weserübung, which was entirely the work of OKW and the OKM. Halder initially doubted that Germany could successfully invade France. General Erich von Manstein's bold plan for invading France through the Ardennes Forest proved successful, and ultimately led to the Fall of France. In early April 1940, Halder had a secret meeting with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who asked him to consider a putsch while the Phoney War (the lull in the war between the invasion of Poland and the invasion of France) was still on, hoping that the British and French were still open to a negotiated peace. Halder refused Goerdeler's request. Goerdeler told Halder that too many people had already died in the war, and his refusal to remove Hitler at this point would ensure that the blood of millions would be on his hands. Halder told Goerdeler that his oath to Hitler and his belief in Germany`s inevitable victory in the war precluded his acting against the Nazi regime. Halder told Goerdeler that [...] "The military situation of Germany, particularly on account of the pact of non-aggression with Russia is such that a breach of my oath to the Führer could not possibly be justified", that only if Germany was faced with total defeat would he consider breaking his oath, and that Goerdeler <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> to believe that World War II could be ended with a compromise peace.|$|E
