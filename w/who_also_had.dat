5|$|Georgia's defense {{managed a}} strong {{performance}} statistically and in real terms. The most obvious {{examples of this}} were the threeinterceptions and one forced fumble {{that proved to be}} the turning point in the game. Two of the interceptions were caught by linebacker Tony Taylor, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> ninetackles, two for a loss of yards. The tackles tied him with Paul Oliver, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> nine. The third interception came from Kelin Johnson, while the fumble was forced by Charles Johnson. Johnson had an active day as well. In addition to the forced fumble, he recorded fourtackles, twosacks, and a passbreak-up.|$|E

5|$|Imamura was {{up against}} a resourceful, {{resolute}} and aggressive opponent, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> access to good intelligence. Allied Ultra codebreakers were reading the Japanese shipping codes, and, by 3 January 1943, Allied commanders knew in advance about the force that Adachi was planning to send from Rabaul to Lae, although {{they did not know}} the force's ultimate destination. Blamey chose not to wait for this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade to move from Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E

5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} {{to be present}} as he broke open his secret instructions.

A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated to do most of the searching, but the Falcon would act as aid and protection. These instructions were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the ear of King Charles II.|$|E

5|$|Torres was {{selected}} in Del Bosque's Euro 2012 squad. In {{his first start}} of the tournament, he netted two goals as Spain defeated the Republic of Ireland 4–0 to eliminate them from the tournament. In the tournament final, Torres came on as a substitute against Italy, scoring one goal and assisting another, as Spain won a second consecutive European Championship with a 4–0 victory. This secured him the Golden Boot for the tournament with three goals and one assist, having played fewer minutes than Mario Gómez, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> three goals and one assist.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat {{met up with}} the Ladybird, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{suffered}} {{a car crash}} in the Río Negro province in 1999, during the campaign of governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route6, and he was ejected from the car {{because he was not}} wearing a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems later in the year led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E

5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E

5|$|Despite only {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} the Scottish League in 1955, Hibs {{were invited to participate}} in the first season of the European Cup, which was not strictly based on league positions at that time. Eighteen clubs who were thought would generate interest across Europe and <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the floodlights necessary to play games at night, were invited to participate. Floodlights had been used at Easter Road for the first time in a friendly match against Hearts on 18 October 1954.

General Count de Nansouty {{and his wife had}} only one child, Étienne Champion de Nansouty (1803–1865), who, having followed his father's and grandfather's footsteps in the military, rose to the rank of squadron commander, but then resigned from the army. General Count Nansouty also had a nephew, Charles-Étienne Champion de Nansouty, who saw a successful military career and who later rose to the rank of general of division.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet was {{the only}} driver not {{to start with the}} softer {{compound}} dry-weather tyres on a track which was still drying from morning rain, with the Brazilian opting for the harder tyre available. There was a strong chance of showers predicted during the race. Several cars were slow away on the slippery track, most notably Kovalainen. The main beneficiaries off the line were Piquet and Trulli, who each gained five places. Trulli was hit from behind at the first corner by Bourdais, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a quick start. The Toyota suffered diffuser and gearbox damage from the incident, spinning later in the lap. Kovalainen and Heidfeld also collided at the start. This allowed Alonso to gain several places. Sebastian Vettel locked his brakes and ran wide, losing two places. Fisichella collided with Nakajima on the first lap and had to pit to fix a broken front wing and punctures. Hamilton led from Räikkönen who managed to pass his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on the Kemmel straight.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows {{him that there}} have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days, who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar.|$|E
