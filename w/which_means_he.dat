Richard loses an important contract that would have jump-started his motivational business. Frank encounters the ex-boyfriend who, in leaving him for an academic rival, had prompted his suicide attempt. Edwin dies from a heroin overdose, resulting in the family smuggling the body out of a hospital and nearly having it discovered by the police.

5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E

Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.|$|E

Harris' first experience of military service came in 1807, when he participated in the brief land campaign which accompanied the Bombardment of Copenhagen. He saw action in the skirmish at Køge (which was also the first action of the Duke of Wellington following his return from India). Soon afterwards, he and his unit returned to England on captured Danish vessels.|$|E

Containment is roughly comparable to a life sentence in many other European countries. Kristiansen is serving his sentence at Ila Prison, while Andersen was serving his sentence at Telemark Prison in Skien up until 2012, when he was transferred to a minimum security prison, in order to better prepare him for his eventual release on parole, possible from April 2013.

25|$|In 2003 the Russian {{historian}} V. Totfalushin found {{a document}} in the Russian State Historical Archives which casts doubts on Savin’s claimed age and provides some interesting details about him. The document is {{an excerpt from}} the official memo by the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs on the status of the surviving veterans of the Grande Armée still residing in Russia. According to this document, dated 1834, the French authorities had contacted the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs with a note that Nicolas Savin had requested permission to leave Russia and return home. The memo specifies that, according to the French authorities, Savin was born in Rouen, in Normandy, and had served as a non-commissioned officer in the 24th Chasseurs à Cheval before being captured in 1812 and sent to Saratov, where he had gained Russian citizenship (poddanstvo) in 1813. The memo further notes that in 1816 Savin had married the daughter of a local merchant and had had two sons, Pavel (born in 1821) and Alexander (born in 1828), and two daughters, Avdotia (born in 1823) and Akulina (born in 1825). Totfalushin’s research also questions Savin’s final age, noting that in another document, which Savin submitted to the local authorities in Khvalynsk in 1839, he indicated that he was 52 years old, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> was born about 1787.|$|E
500|$|The {{visualisation}} and {{portrayal of}} landscape {{in an entirely}} new manner was Friedrich's key innovation. He sought not just to explore the blissful enjoyment of a beautiful view, as in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of sublimity, a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature. Friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a self-contained emotive subject. Friedrich's paintings commonly employed the Rückenfigur—a person seen from behind, contemplating the view. The viewer is encouraged to place himself {{in the position of}} the Rückenfigur, by <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> experiences the sublime potential of nature, understanding that the scene is as perceived and idealised by a human. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling—die romantische Stimmungslandschaft. His art details a wide range of geographical features, such as rock coasts, forests, and mountain scenes. [...] He often used the landscape to express religious themes. During his time, most of the best-known paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious mysticism.|$|E
500|$|After {{the series}} finale, the Los Angeles Times {{characterized}} the series as [...] "an epic poem, with Jack Bauer {{in the role}} of Odysseus or Beowulf. <b>Which</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision." [...] The critic {{went on to say that}} villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that [...] "Jack and 24 fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity." [...] One reviewer for BuddyTV said that [...] "I'll remember the legacy of 24 as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy." [...] The New York Times said [...] "24 will live on, possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life the ticking time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11." [...] The show was declared the sixth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).|$|E

500|$|Also in 2010, DiCaprio {{starred in}} {{director}} Christopher Nolan's science-fiction film Inception, also starring Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine. Inspired {{by the experience}} of lucid dreaming and dream incubation, DiCaprio portrays the character of Dom Cobb, an [...] "extractor" [...] who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target's mind. DiCaprio was [...] "intrigued by this concept— this dream-heist notion and how this character's gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." [...] Released to critical acclaim, the film grossed over $825 million worldwide. To star in this film, DiCaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> receives money coming directly {{off the top of}} ticket sales. This risk paid off, with DiCaprio earning $50 million from the film to become his highest payday yet. The movie went on to become Di Caprio's second highest-grossing movie with $293 million at the box office, after Titanic with $659 million and ahead of The Revenant with $184 million.|$|E
500|$|After retiring, Gibbs served Watford as a {{coach for}} three years, {{initially}} working with the reserve and youth teams, and later as an assistant manager. During this period he oversaw the development of players such as Ashley Young, Lloyd Doyley and Hamer Bouazza, and helped Watford to a Premier Reserve League win in 2002–03. Following Ray Lewington's sacking in March 2005, Gibbs briefly managed Watford on a caretaker basis, although his reign {{did not include a}} single game. Following the appointment of Aidy Boothroyd, Gibbs left Watford in July. Having had a formal connection with the club since the 1970s, he felt that his departure had been [...] "very poorly handled". In 2006, Gibbs received his UEFA Pro Licence, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> can manage any football club in England on a full-time basis. At the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Gibbs joined the management team at Reading, where his initial responsibility was working with the younger players at the club. Further Premier Reserve League success followed in 2007, and Gibbs was promoted to the role of assistant manager in 2009–10. On the penultimate game of the season, Reading faced Watford at Vicarage Road. A Reading victory would have put their opponents in danger of relegation, but Watford emerged 3–0 winners to seal their Championship survival. Gibbs remained at Reading under the management of Brian McDermott, and in 2011–12 the team won the Football League Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League. He left Reading on 11 March 2013 following McDermott's departure as manager.|$|E
