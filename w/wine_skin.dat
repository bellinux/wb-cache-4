6000|$|The {{statement}} that Saul [...] "perceived" [...] {{that it was}} Samuel {{is not to be}} taken to imply that, even now, Saul actually saw the shade of the prophet, but only that the woman's allusion to the prophetic mantle and to the aged appearance of the spectre convinced him that it was Samuel. Reuss [3] in fact translates the passage [...] "Alors Saul reconnut que c'etait Samuel." [...] Nor does the dialogue between Saul and Samuel necessarily, or probably, signify that Samuel spoke otherwise than by the voice of the wise woman. The Septuagint does not hesitate to call her [Greek], that is to say, a ventriloquist, implying that it was she who spoke--and this view of the matter is in harmony {{with the fact that the}} exact sense of the Hebrew words which are translated as [...] "a woman that hath a familiar spirit" [...] is [...] "a woman mistress of Ob." [...] Ob means primitively a leather bottle, such as a <b>wine</b> <b>skin,</b> and is applied alike to the necromancer and to the spirit evoked. Its use, in these senses, appears to have been suggested by the likeness of the hollow sound emitted by a half-empty skin when struck, to the sepulchral tones in which the oracles of the evoked spirits were uttered by the medium. It is most probable that, in accordance with the general theory of spiritual influences which obtained among the old Israelites, the spirit of Samuel was conceived to pass into the body of the wise woman, and to use her vocal organs to speak in his own name--for I cannot discover that they drew any clear distinction between possession and inspiration.

Raspberry extract contained mainly delphinidin- 3 -O-glucoside and cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside. The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was assayed by electrochemical methods.

The skins contain color pigment, phenols and tannins that would normally be considered undesirable for white wines, while for red <b>wines</b> <b>skin</b> contact and maceration is {{a vital part of the}} winemaking process that gives red wine its color, flavor, and texture.

The aim of this work was therefore to reveal the "terroir" expression within the chemodiversity of grapes and related wines, using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Grapes and corresponding wines, from two distinct - though very proximate - terroirs of Burgundy were analyzed over three vintages (2010, 2011 and 2012). Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography were used as untargeted and targeted approaches to discriminate complex chemical fingerprints for vintages, classes (<b>wines,</b> <b>skins</b> or musts), and terroirs.

This study aims at quantitatively analyzing the influence of skin anatomy variables on perceived skin color. Reflectance spectra for visible light from normal and Port <b>Wine</b> Stain <b>skin</b> have been calculated using a Monte Carlo algorithm applied to a multi-layered skin model.

Distribution of a constant volume of blood in smaller vessels results in a redder and darker color.

40|$|Probably {{the oldest}} natural food {{colorant}} was «enocyanin». It is produced from grape skins as {{a by-product of}} the wine industry {{in a number of}} countries, particularly Italy. The recovery of pigments from grape by-products has received considerable attention. Since <b>wine</b> grape <b>skins</b> are waste disposal problem, obviously the source material is available at very low cost. The pigments in the Vitis vinifera group are 3 -monoglucosides of cyanidin, peonidin, malvidin, petunidin, plus the same compounds acylated with acetic, coumaric or caffeic acid. The hybrids may also contain the 3 - 5 -diglucosides of the same aglycones and acylated compounds. Colorants from grapes may be expected to contain a number of other flavonoids, tannin, organic acids, etc. The anthocyanins show greatest stability under acidic conditions, but are generally unstable and degrade easily according to various reaction mechanisms. The degradation is influenced by oxygen, ascorbic acid, light, pH and temperature. Processing conditions used for the extraction and purification of pigments from <b>wine</b> grape <b>skins</b> can influence color stability. The present work was undertaken to study how pH (pH 2, 3, 4, 5), time (15 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) and temperature (4 °C, 24 °C, 36 °C) influence the color stability of enocyanins concentrated by ultrafiltration, inverse osmosis and under vacuum. The color of the different samples has been measured both by spectrophotometry and by Hunter L*, a*, b* values. The spectrophotometric (A 420; A 520; T; I) and colorimetric (L*, a*, b*) data resulted correlated significantly. Therefore colorimetric parameters which can be obtained by using a simple, rapid and easy method were used in order to study the color changes of the different enocyanins in the storage conditions. The obtained results have shown that the concentration techniques by ultrafiltration and inverse osmosis produced enocyanins characterized by a distinct red color, which was intense, but unstable in relation to pH variation. On the contrary, the enocyanins concentrated under vacuum resulted characterized by a poor red color, which was stable in relation to pH changes. In our experimental conditions, the results obtained showed that the degradation of the red color, in relation to time and temperature, proved to be independent of the concentration technique used. A ready visualization of the chromatic evolution of the different enocyanins, with reference to the stability parameters studied, was obtained using the color diagram...|$|R
