5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|David {{begins by}} sending poison pen letters to Nick's wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), which state that Nick {{is having an}} affair. Nick realises David is behind the letters. Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained that David is worried that Kylie <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> betrayed he knew all along and does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs {{the steering wheel and}} causes a car crash. Price believed David was not trying to murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E
5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> {{a sense of personal}} loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E

He thinks that a building must stand in spectacular relationship to its environment. With the pool and terrace positioned in the centre of the house, the engagement between the indoor and outdoor spaces then became ambiguous. It creates a sense of feeling when one is inside, it <b>will</b> <b>feels</b> like outdoors and when one is outside it <b>will</b> <b>feels</b> like indoors. One of his design principal was that he thinks of views or views from the building first, instead of the form of the building. Therefore, glass panels are used across the living and dining areas to capture the view of the bay.|$|R
5|$|In the sub-plot, Lisa {{discovers that}} the senior {{citizens}} at Grampa's nursing home {{do not have}} any entertainment, and decides to buy them a digital TV converter. However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E
5|$|Red Dead Redemption {{makes use}} of a {{morality}} system where players {{have the ability to}} gain positive or negative honor. Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player character's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, non-player characters <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> insecure around him. If he has a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet him and feel safe around him. He will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses. A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this he can disguise himself by wearing a bandana when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E
