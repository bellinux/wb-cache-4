Now both principal leaders of the expedition were injured or unhorsed, and their men were tired, thirsty, and exhausting their ammunition. [...] A few surrendered or were captured; some now broke formation and ran forward toward Lexington. [...] In the words of one British officer, [...] "we began to run rather than retreat in order. ... <b>We</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> stop the men and form them two deep, but to no purpose, the confusion increased rather than lessened. ... the officers got to the front and presented their bayonets, and told the men if they advanced they should die.

[...] In addition to Petula Clark's [...] "Downtown", [...] "Down Town" [...] used elements of the distinctive bassline to Harold Faltermeyer's 1984 # 1 single [...] "Axel F". [...] Indeed, the labels of the record claimed that: [...] "All sounds on this recording have been captured by The KLF. In the name of Mu, we hereby liberate these sounds from all copyright restrictions, without prejudice". [...] Although The JAMs sought permission from Tony Hatch, who wrote Clark's [...] "Downtown", Drummond admitted in KLF Communications newsletter: [...] "We were surprised to read in the papers that Pet Clarke [...] had given her permission for us to sample her classic 'Downtown' on our record of the same name. When <b>we</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> contact her, at her Swiss home, to do just this thing, we didn't get further than her refusing to accept our transfer charge." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} maximizing the disconnectivity of undirected graphs by deleting a subset of their nodes. We consider three metrics that measure the connectivity of a graph: the number of connected components (which <b>we</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> maximize), the largest component size (which <b>we</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> minimize), and the minimum cost required to reconnect the graph after the nodes are deleted (which <b>we</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> maximize). <b>We</b> formulate each problem as a mixed-integer program, and then study valid inequalities {{for the first two}} connectivity objectives by examining intermediate dynamic programming solutions to k-hole subgraphs. We randomly generate a set of test instances, on which we demonstrate the computational efficacy of our approaches...|$|R

We filled on her, as there was no room to wear we made another attempt to stay her She would not stay, however, and the anchor was accordingly let go, which brought her up A kedge was then run out to try and heave her off and when we got to work the vessel was gradually being dragged off when the line unfortunately gave way. All this time the schooner was hanging by the anchor, with her stern just clear of the rocks, and the surf was beginning to break in heavily. Just after the kedge line parted, the pawls of the windlass gave way, and then, nothing holding her she headed right round for the rocks, upon which she was dashed very shortly afterwards We had just enough time to snatch up some of our clothes, get into the boat, which was alongside and pull away. We pulled out Into the bay, and the schooner Harold bound from Wollongong to the waterworks with a cargo of coal coming up at the time we got on board of her and were all landed safely at the Waterworks, whence we came on to Sydney ...|$|E
