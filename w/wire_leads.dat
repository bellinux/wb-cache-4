25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors (CCR) {{consist of}} a solid cylindrical resistive element with embedded <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> or metal end caps to which the lead wires are attached. The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the lead wires were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrangement}} of plates and dielectric has many variations {{depending on the}} desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> bonded to the coating. Larger values {{can be made by}} multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plasticthese are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.|$|E
25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had <b>wire</b> <b>leads,</b> and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E
2500|$|Components were {{mechanically}} redesigned to {{have small}} metal tabs or end caps {{that could be}} soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> to pass through holes. [...] Components became much smaller and component placement {{on both sides of}} the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{introduction}} in the 1990s, high-frequency ballasts {{have been}} used in general lighting fixtures with either rapid start or pre-heat lamps. These ballasts convert the incoming power to an output frequency in excess of [...] This increases lamp efficiency. These are used in several applications, including new generation tanning lamp systems, whereby a 100 watt lamp (e.g., F71T12BP) can be lit using 90 watts of actual power while obtaining the same luminous flux (measured in lumens) as magnetic ballasts. [...] These ballasts operate with voltages that can be almost 600 volts, requiring some consideration in housing design, and can cause a minor limitation in the length of the <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> from the ballast to the lamp ends.|$|E
2500|$|Wirewound {{resistors}} {{are commonly}} made by winding a metal wire, usually nichrome, around a ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core. The {{ends of the}} wire are soldered or welded to two caps or rings, attached {{to the ends of}} the core. The assembly is protected with a layer of paint, molded plastic, or an enamel coating baked at high temperature. These resistors are designed to withstand unusually high temperatures of up to 450°C. <b>Wire</b> <b>leads</b> in low power wirewound resistors are usually between 0.6 and 0.8mm in diameter and tinned for ease of soldering. For higher power wirewound resistors, either a ceramic outer case or an aluminum outer case on top of an insulating layer is used – if the outer case is ceramic, such resistors are sometimes described as [...] "cement" [...] resistors, though they do not actually contain any traditional cement. The aluminum-cased types are designed to be attached to a heat sink to dissipate the heat; the rated power is dependent on being used with a suitable heat sink, e.g., a 50 W power rated resistor overheats at a fraction of the power dissipation if not used with a heat sink. Large wirewound resistors may be rated for 1,000 watts or more.|$|E

40|$|For {{calculations}} and measurements of transient characteristics of groundings, {{the current and}} potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> are frequently used accordingly to inject the current into the grounding and find the grounding potential rise (GPR). The results of the {{calculations and}} measurements can be dependent on {{the location of the}} current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> due to mutual influence between them and the grounding wire. It is important to determine to what extent the location of the wires influences the calculation results for the grounding with a simple configuration. Notably, in contrast to the measurements, for the calculations it is possible to locate wires vertically, also the potential <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> can be replaced by the integral of the electric field. For the calculations the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been used in the work. In order to estimate to what extent the calculated GPR can be influenced by location of the wires, calculations with different wires locations have been carried out. An analysis of the calculation results has been made. There are calculation methods in which the injection of the current and calculation of the GPR are performed without the current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires.</b> The method based on the telegrapher's equations is one of such methods. In order to determine what location of the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> gives the same calculation results as those of the method that uses the telegrapher's equations, a comparison of calculation results of two methods has been made. Based on the calculation results it can be concluded that the calculated transient characteristics depend to a different extent on such factors as mutual location of the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> and the grounding wire, replacing the potential <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> by the integral of the electric field, electrical parameters of the soil. Location of one of the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> above the grounding wire significantly reduces the calculated GPR. Calculation results for a perpendicular location of three <b>wires</b> (the <b>lead</b> ones and the grounding wire) using the FDTD method correspond to those of the method based on the telegrapher's equation. ...|$|R

In contrast to the Laudau damping of the collective excitations, these gaps are attributed to tunneling assisted acoustic plasmon-quasiparticle excitation resonances.

50|$|Smaller {{spark gaps}} {{are often used}} to protect {{sensitive}} electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small spark gap breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the spark gaps help protect the building and internal telephone circuits {{from the effects of}} lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) spark gaps are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark that jumps from <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> across the gap left by the sawing process. These low-cost devices are often used to prevent damaging arcs between the elements of the electron gun(s) within a cathode ray tube (CRT).|$|R
