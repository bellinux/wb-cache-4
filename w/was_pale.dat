5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill <b>was</b> <b>pale</b> pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel {{spent his}} early life living in fabulous splendor {{on the last}} period of Imperial Russia. His father, a {{respected}} poet, was a first cousin once removed of Tsar Nicholas II {{and one of the}} wealthiest members of the Romanov family. As a child, Gabriel was frail and or poor health; he <b>was</b> <b>pale</b> and prone to illness. He and Ivan were both often sick and together spent {{more than a year of}} their childhood living at Oreanda in the Crimea, with a doctor and several servants. Their health improved in the temperate climate, and the boys enjoyed their time spent on the beaches and in short tours around the peninsula. With only each other, for company, they forged a strong sibling relationship that was to last to the ends of their lives.|$|E

500|$|Corpses swell as gases from {{decomposition}} {{accumulate in}} the torso {{and the increased}} pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look [...] "plump", [...] "well-fed", and [...] "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person <b>was</b> <b>pale</b> or thin in life. In the Arnold Paole case, an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy {{than she had ever}} looked in life. The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.|$|E
500|$|Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle {{said that}} the track was [...] "more filler than truly fascinating." [...] Douglas Wolk from Pitchfork Media commented that the {{presence}} of [...] "Revolver" [...] on the Celebration compilation disc <b>was</b> <b>pale</b> compared to Madonna's previous sex-themed songs like [...] "Justify My Love" [...] (1990) and [...] "Erotica" [...] (1992). Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine called the song a clumsy collaboration. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph said that [...] "Revolver" [...] shows off Lil Wayne's skills as a singer better than Madonna's. The One Love Club mix of the song, by David Guetta, won a Grammy in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category of the 53rd Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Statistically, Kilner's peak as a bowler {{came in the}} 1923 season, when he took 158 wickets at {{an average}} of 12.90 and {{finished}} second in the Yorkshire averages. With the bat, he failed to score a hundred {{for the first time since}} 1912, but still made 1,401 runs at 34.17 and including nine scores over fifty. This placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages, his contributions helping his team to retain the County Championship. He made a very effective start to the season, taking 27 wickets in the first four matches for just 157 runs, including the best figures of his career, eight for 26 against Glamorgan, and six for 14 against Middlesex. [...] Later that season against Surrey, he performed what was regarded by Wisden as one of his best bowling feats. Surrey needed 184 runs to win and seemed certain winners when they had scored 127 for two. After Emmott Robinson took a wicket, Kilner took the last five for only 15 runs in a match-winning performance. He finished with bowling figures of six for 22 and took ten wickets in the match. He had been under the impression that Surrey had only needed seven runs (rather than the 27 they required) to win at the end, and his team-mates remembered he <b>was</b> <b>pale</b> with effort and concentration. In the same season, Kilner was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's Cricket Ground, the most prestigious such fixture at the time, where he scored eight in his only innings and took three wickets. Wisden commented that he seemed certain to be picked for the England Test match side shortly (there were no Tests played that summer). He took a step towards this when he was selected for a Test trial match, scoring 26 and 11 not out, but only bowling 18 overs in the match to take two wickets. He also made another appearance for the Players, this time at Scarborough. His performances in the season earned him selection as one of Wisden's Bowlers of the Year.|$|E

2500|$|In Germany it {{is called}} Spätburgunder (lit. [...] "Late Burgundian"), {{and is now the}} most widely planted red grape. Historically much German wine {{produced}} from Pinot noir <b>was</b> <b>pale,</b> often rosé like the red wines of Alsace; over-cropping and bunch-rot were major contributing factors to this. However, recently, despite the northerly climate, darker, richer reds have been produced, often barrel (barrique) aged, in regions such as Baden, Palatinate (Pfalz) and Ahr. These are rarely exported and are often expensive in Germany for the better examples. As [...] "Rhenish", German Pinot noir is mentioned several times in Shakespearean plays as a highly prized wine.|$|E
2500|$|When in August 1791 Mozart {{arrived in}} Prague to {{supervise}} the performance of his new opera La clemenza di Tito (K. 621), he was [...] "already very ill" [...] (Abert, p.1305). During this visit, Niemetschek wrote, [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>pale</b> and expression was sad, although his good humour was often shown in merry jest with his friends." [...] Following his return to Vienna (mid September 1791), Mozart's condition gradually worsened. For a while, he {{was still able to}} work and completed his Clarinet Concerto (K. 622), worked toward the completion of his Requiem (K. 626), and conducted the premiere performance of The Magic Flute (K. 620) on 30 September. Still, he became increasingly alarmed and despondent about his health. An anecdote from Constanze is related by Niemetschek: ...|$|E

2500|$|Túrin {{is said to}} {{have been}} greatly {{affected}} by the deaths of his friends; thus after overcoming pestilence himself and the death of Lalaith, Túrin's character was hardened and he became even more reserved. Tolkien also stated that Túrin ever after [...] "sought in all faces of women the face of Lalaith," [...] that he did not love Finduilas because [...] "his mind and heart were elsewhere, by rivers in springs long past," [...] and that Túrin did fall in love with Níniel because she reminded him of Lalaith.
