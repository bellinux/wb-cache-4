5|$|Compared to {{the other}} crested newt species, the Danube crested newt is more adapted to life along a river system and {{frequently}} occurs in flowing water and together <b>with</b> <b>fish.</b> Typical breeding sites are slow-flowing river margins, oxbow lakes, flooded marshland, larger ponds, or ditches, provided abundant underwater vegetation is available. During land phase, the newts live in deciduous forests or groves, bushlands, or meadows.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the giant}} panda, they cannot digest cellulose, {{so they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they {{supplement}} their diets <b>with</b> <b>fish</b> and insects. They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.|$|E
5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} <b>with</b> <b>fish</b> began before the {{reservoir}} was filled, with a small rearing pond being placed {{on the bottom of}} the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, rainbow trout, striped bass, channel catfish, and shad. It is considered one of the best fisheries in California.|$|E
5|$|The Algodones Dunes {{were formed}} from sand {{deposited}} by Lake Cahuilla, which was transported by wind toward the area. During its existence, the lake supported a rich biota <b>with</b> <b>fish,</b> bivalves and vegetation on its shorelines. These resources supported human populations on its shores, {{as evidenced by}} a number of archeological sites and mythological references to the lake in the traditions of the Cahuilla. The lake may have had profound effects on population genetics and language history of the surrounding regions.|$|E

5|$|There was mass {{unemployment}} among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary {{evidence shows that}} those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably. In addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled <b>with</b> <b>fish,</b> and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.|$|E

5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks.

5|$|Carménère wine has a {{deep red}} color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon {{and it is a}} medium body wine. As a result many find it can be drunk easily <b>with</b> <b>fish.</b> Although mostly used as a {{blending}} grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The wine is best to drink while it is young.|$|E
5|$|Eudimorphodonts can {{be divided}} into two major categories-those with long, robust wings similar to Campylognathoides, and those with long, slender wings. Species in the former category, {{including}} Carniadactylus and Eudimorphodon itself, were highly aerial animals and fast, agile flyers. The former was almost certainly insectivorous due to its small size; Eudimorphodon has been found <b>with</b> <b>fish</b> remains in its stomach. Slender-winged species, such as Austriadactylus and Caviramus, were likely terrestrial/semiarboreal in habits, and potentially generalists. Caviramus likely had a strong bite force, indicating an adaptation towards hard foods. All eudimorphodonts possessed well-developed molariform teeth and could chew their food, as indicated by the tooth wear on Caviramus and Eudimorphodon teeth. Austriadactylus and Eudimorphodon had a pair of these molariform teeth developed into enlarged fangs.|$|E
5|$|In April 1869, the U.S. Senate {{overwhelmingly}} {{rejected a}} proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress; publicly denounced Queen Victoria; demanded a huge reparation; {{and opened the}} possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks {{had to be put}} off until matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet <b>with</b> <b>Fish.</b> A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871 in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.|$|E

5|$|In Florida, nesting {{habitats}} often {{consist of}} mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pines (P. palustris), loblolly pines (P. taeda) and cypress trees, {{but for the}} southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (Tsuga) at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked <b>with</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked <b>with</b> <b>fish</b> and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little <b>with</b> <b>fish</b> caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E
