5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering {{speed of a}} turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{regarded}} {{his series}} of sermons on the Seven Seals in 1963 as {{a highlight of}} his ministry. In reality, Branham's teaching on this subject revealed very little new doctrine and <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> laborious restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Kimball married, {{his father}} {{called him to}} serve as clerk for the St. Joseph Stake. In the 1920s, local stake clerks still {{performed}} the extensive record-keeping and reporting duties that are now digitized and done centrally at the LDS Church's headquarters in Salt Lake City. The position of stake clerk <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> part-time job, and those called were paid a monthly salary of $50.|$|E

5|$|The university's first {{classes were}} held in at Burnside Place, James McGill's country home. Burnside Place {{remained}} the sole educational facility until the 1840s, when the school began construction on its first buildings: the central and east wings of the Arts Building. The rest of the campus <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> cow pasture, a situation similar to the few other Canadian universities and early American colleges of the age.|$|E
5|$|A Geschwaderstab <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> Headquarters Unit (Stabschwarm) for {{the entire}} wing. There were {{headquarters}} units also at gruppe level. Initially when JG 1 was re-formed in Jever, it was constituted as a Regional Fighter Command (Jagdfliegerführer 2) on 30 November 1939 with an intention to co-ordinate with navy (Kriegsmarine) flak and signals units. This autonomous command defending the coastline was placed under Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher. Geschwaderstab JG 1 (Stab. JG 1) was also alternatively called JG Nord or JG Schumacher and was equipped with Bf 109 'D' and 'E' variants.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E

5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, {{the sections of}} UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the sack}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the office's {{continuity}} was broken, {{and when it}} reappears in {{the sources of the}} Palaiologan period, it had lost any judicial functions and resembled more its original military character: according to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic, charged with the night watch and with supervising the army's scouts. In reality, however, it had become more of a sinecure and <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> court dignity devoid of any but ceremonial duties.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> MAR {{with half of}} the elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June, the Second Armistice at Compiègne {{was signed}} between France and Germany ending hostilities. Northern and western France was placed under direct German occupation, while Alsace-Lorraine {{became part of}} Germany. Italy would control its own zone in the southeast, and an unoccupied zone, the zone libre, would be governed by the newly formed Vichy {{government}} (État Français) led by Pétain. Vichy was nominally independent, and still controlled French overseas colonies, but in practice <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> German client state.|$|E

5|$|Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina {{were each}} {{subjected}} to attacks from the other, and the English engaged the French based at Mobile in what <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> proxy war involving primarily allied American Indians on both sides. The southern war {{did not result}} in significant territorial changes, but it had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida, including parts of present-day southern Georgia, and destroying Spain's network of missions in the area.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> {{combination of}} {{the barrel of the}} 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> UK {{version of}} the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single {{transmitter}} located off {{the far end of}} the active runway that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E

5|$|With {{an economy}} {{fundamentally}} dependent upon a single industry, {{there was a}} scarcity of paid employment for women in Rhondda's coalmining heyday. The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes {{that the image of}} the Welsh Mam, a wife and mother constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> Rhondda creation. However the Rhondda did produce the suffragette and social reformer Elizabeth Andrews, one of only nine women among a list of a hundred greatest Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari {{states that}} al-Mu'tasim fell ill on 21 October 841. His regular doctor, Salmawayh ibn Bunan, whom the Caliph had trusted implicitly, had died the {{previous}} year and the new physician Yahya ibn Masawayh did not follow the normal treatment of cupping and purging, which according to Hunayn ibn Ishaq worsened the caliph's illness and brought about his death on 5 January 842, after a reign of eight years, eight months and two days according to the Islamic calendar. He {{was buried in the}} Jawsaq al-Khaqani palace in Samarra. The succession of his son, al-Wathiq, was unopposed. Al-Wathiq's reign, through unremarkable, <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> continuation of al-Mu'tasim's own, as the government continued to be led by the men al-Mu'tasim had raised to power: the Turks Itakh, Wasif, and Ashinas, the vizier Ibn al-Zayyat, and the chief qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race <b>was</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>a</b> three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
