2500|$|Constitution {{typically}} {{has implications}} for views on persistence: [...] how does an object persist over time if any of its parts (materials) change or are removed, {{as is the case}} with humans who lose cells, change height, hair color, memories, and yet <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be the same person today as we were when we were first born. For example, Ted Sider is the same today as he was when he was born—he just changed. But how can this be if many parts of Ted today did not exist when Ted was just born? Is it possible for things, such as organisms to persist? And if so, how? There are several views that attempt to answer this question. Some of the views are as follows (note, there are several other views): ...|$|E

40|$|Published online: 5 December 2008 This {{paper is}} about the relevance, to the {{definition}} of freedom, of values or goods other than freedom. In this respect,its subject matter is not at all new. However, I do believe that new light can be thrown on the nature of this relationship by paying more attention to another relationship – one which exists within the concept of freedom itself. There are two senses in which <b>we</b> can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> possess freedom. Firstly, there is the sense in which <b>we</b> can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free to do a certain particular thing. Secondly, there is the sense in which <b>we</b> can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> possess a certain 'amount','degree' or 'quantity' of freedom, in some overall sense. I believe that most recent accounts of the relationship between freedom and other goods are inconsistent, because they see those other goods as affecting the truth value of claims about freedom in the second sense, but not in the first...|$|R
60|$|See here, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be justified, {{reconciled}} already, {{and therefore}} we shall be saved, justified by his blood and death, and saved through him by his life.|$|E
60|$|Fourth. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be made nigh to God by his blood--'But now in Christ Jesus, ye who {{sometimes}} were far off, are made nigh by {{the blood of}} Christ' (Eph 2:13).|$|E
6000|$|... 2. As {{they must}} be brought to, so {{they must be}} helped to lay hold on Christ by faith; for as coming to Christ, so faith, is not in our own power; {{therefore}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be raised up with him [...] "through {{the faith of the}} operation of God." [...] And again, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> believe, [...] "according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead" [...] (Col 2:12; Eph 1:19,20). Now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be saved by faith, because by faith we lay hold of, venture upon, and put on Jesus Christ for life. For life, I say, because God having made him the Saviour, hath given him life to communicate to sinners, and the life that he communicates to them is the merit of his flesh and blood, which whoso eateth and drinketh by faith, hath eternal life, because that flesh and blood hath merit in it sufficient to obtain the favour of God. Yea, it hath done so [since] that day it was offered through the eternal Spirit a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour to him; wherefore God imputeth the righteousness of Christ to him that believeth in him, by which righteousness he is personally justified, and saved from that just judgment of the law that was due unto him (John 5:26, 6:53-58; Eph 4:32; 5:2; Rom 4:23-25).|$|E

6000|$|Both these scriptures {{speak of}} the resurrection of Christ, of the resurrection of his body on the third day; but behold, as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>said</b> before <b>to</b> suffer and be dead with him, so now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> also <b>to</b> rise and live in God's sight by the resurrection of his body. For, as <b>was</b> <b>said,</b> the flesh <b>was</b> ours; he took part of our flesh {{when he came into}} the world; and in it he suffered, died, and rose again (Heb 2:14). <b>We</b> also <b>were</b> {{therefore}} counted by God, in that God-man, when he did this; yea, he suffered, died, and rose as a common head.[6] ...|$|R
60|$|Sixth. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be {{justified}} by his blood. 'Much more then, being now justified by his blood, {{we shall be}} saved from wrath through him' (Rom 5:9). Justified, that is, acquitted--1. Acquitted before God (Eph 5:26,27). 2. Acquitted before angels (Matt 28:5-8). 3. Acquitted by the law (Rom 3:21-23). 4. Acquitted {{in the court of}} conscience (Heb 9:14).|$|E
6000|$|... 1. The {{length and}} breadth of the mercy-seat is the same {{with that of the}} ark: perhaps to show us, that the length {{and breadth of}} the mercy of God to his elect, is the same with the length and breadth of the merits of Christ (Exo 25:10,17). Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be {{justified}} in him, blessed in him, even according to the purpose which God purposed in him.|$|E
60|$|Third. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be purged by his blood. 1. Purged from sin before God--'When he had {{by himself}} purged our sins, {{he sat down}} on the right hand of God' (Heb 1:3). 2. Purged from evil {{conscience}}s--'How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?' (Heb 9:14).|$|E

6000|$|But at last {{a servant}} <b>was</b> engaged; <b>we</b> might <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the window, gloomily {{waiting for her}} now, and it was with such words as these that we sought to comfort each other and ourselves:— ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the present}} days <b>we</b> may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{live in a}} Kali Yuga, which <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have started in 3102 BCE {{with the end of}} the Mahabharata war. This date is also {{considered}} by many Hindus to be the day that Krishna left Earth and went to his abode.|$|R
60|$|Third. Therefore {{justifying}} righteousness is {{the doing}} and suffering of Christ {{when he was}} in the world. This is clear, because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be 'justified by his obedience,' by his obedience to the law (Rom 5:19). Hence he is said again to be the end of the law for that very thing--'Christ is the end of the law for righteousness,' &c. (Rom 10:4). The end, what is that? Why, the requirement or demand of the law. But what are they? Why, righteousness, perfect righteousness (Gal 3:10). Perfect righteousness, what to do? That the soul concerned might stand spotless in the sight of God (Rev 1:5). Now this lies only in the doings and sufferings of Christ; for 'by his obedience many are made righteous'; wherefore as to this, Christ is the end of the law, that being found in that obedience, that becomes to us sufficient for our justification. Hence <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be made righteous by his obedience; yea, and to be washed, purged, and justified by his blood (Heb 9:14; Rom 5:18,19).|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. The {{answer to}} this {{question}} is very simple, at least in its first aspect. The sole condition is, that what is supposed to have been observed shall really have been observed; that it be an observation, not an inference. For in almost every act of our perceiving faculties, observation and inference are intimately blended. What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> observe is usually a compound result, of which one-tenth may be observation, and the remaining nine-tenths inference.|$|E
60|$|A wall is for defence, {{and so is}} the {{humanity}} of Jesus Christ. It is, was, and will be, our defence for ever. For it was that which underwent and overcame the curse of the law, and that in which our everlasting righteousness is found. Had he not in that interposed, we had perished for ever. Hence <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be reconciled to God in the body of his flesh through death (Col 1:19,20; Rom 5:8-10).|$|E
60|$|Second. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> also <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{washed in}} his blood. 1. Our persons are washed--He 'loved us, and washed {{us from our}} sins in his own blood' (Rev 1:5). 2. His blood washeth also our performances--'Our robes are washed, and made white {{in the blood of}} the Lamb' (Rev 7:14).|$|R
5000|$|In April 1757, {{a band of}} Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a {{warehouse}} near Fort Edward, killing thirteen British soldiers. After loading with what provisions they could carry, they {{set fire to the}} building. [...] A few days later, the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland. [...] Because of the strength of the Acadian militia and Mi'kmaq militia, British officer John Knox wrote that “In the year 1757 <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Masters of the province of Nova Scotia, or Acadia, which, however, was only an imaginary possession.“ He continues to state that the situation in the province was so precarious for the British that the “troops and inhabitants” at Fort Edward, Fort Sackville and Lunenburg “could not be reputed in any other light than as prisoners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That follows by no means, commodore, as I {{have some}} reason to know; for my father having been a parson, and I being a seaman, <b>we</b> may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have the whole subject, as it were, in the family. St. Paul-- you have {{heard of such a}} man as St. Paul, commodore?--" ...|$|R
60|$|Hence <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{be chosen}} in him, to be gathered, being in him, {{to be dead}} by him, to be risen with him, and to be set with him, or in him, in heavenly places already (Rom 7:4; Eph 1:4,10; Col 2:12,13, 3:1-3). This, then, was {{the wisdom of the}} great God, that the Eternal Son of his love should take hold of, and so secure the sinking souls of {{perishing}} sinners by assuming their flesh.|$|E
6000|$|... (3.) To secure {{this the}} more to our faith that believe, as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be 'raised up {{together}}' with him, so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be 'made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus' (Eph 2:6). We died by him, we rose by him, and are together, even all the elect, set down 'together' in 'heavenly places in Christ Jesus'; for still, even {{now he is}} on the right hand of God, he is to be considered as our public man, our Head, and so one in whom is concluded all the elect of God. We then are by him already in heaven; in heaven, I say, by him; yea, set down there in our places of glory by him. Hence the apostle, speaking of us again, saith, That as we are predestinate, we are called, justified, and glorified; called, justified, glorified; all is done, already done, as thus considered in Christ (Rom 8:30). For that in his public work there is nothing yet to do as to this. Is not HE called? Is not HE justified? Is not HE glorified? And are we not in him, in him, even as so considered? ...|$|E
6000|$|... (5.) Hence <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be made {{willing to}} come, {{by the power}} of God; to be raised from a state of sin to a state of grace, {{by the power of}} God; and to believe, that is to come, through the {{exceeding}} working of his mighty power (Psa 110:3; Col 2:12; Eph 1:18,20; Job 23:14). But this needed not, if either man had power or will to come; or so much as graciously to think of being willing to come, of themselves, to Jesus Christ.|$|E
