The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies.

40|$|Summary This paper compares a {{standard}} labor demand model to another augmented by the real exchange rate (RER) when studying {{the growth of}} dynamic Mexican maquiladoras from 1990 to 2006.

In the augmented models, skilled labor employment becomes very sensitive to its own wages. Also, the user cost of capital has a larger negative impact on skilled employment, and a <b>weaker</b> <b>currency</b> has a negative impact on unskilled employment only.

50|$|Liberals {{typically}} {{argue for}} government action or {{partnership with the}} private sector to improve job creation. Typical proposals involve stimulus spending on infrastructure construction, clean energy investment, unemployment compensation, educational loan assistance, and retraining programs. Liberals historically supported labor unions and protectionist trade policies. Liberals tend to be less concerned with budget deficits and debt and have a higher tolerance for inflation or currency devaluation to improve trade competitiveness, as a <b>weaker</b> <b>currency</b> makes exports relatively less expensive. During recessions, liberals generally advocate solutions based on Keynesian economics, which argues for additional government spending when the private sector is unable or unwilling to support sufficient levels of economic growth.|$|R

Between the years 1860 and 1865, the cost of living nearly doubled. As is the case in all inflationary periods, there were winners and losers created by the significant fall in currency value, with banks and creditors receiving less real value from the loans repaid by debtors.

50|$|Increasing {{the money}} supply tends to {{depreciate}} a country's exchange rates relative to other currencies, through the mechanism of the interest rate. Lower interest rates lead to a capital outflow from a country, thereby reducing foreign demand for a country's money, leading to a <b>weaker</b> <b>currency.</b> This feature of QE directly benefits exporters living in the country performing QE, as well as debtors, since the interest rate has fallen, meaning there is less money to be repaid. However, it directly harms creditors as they earn less money from lower interest rates. Devaluation of a currency also directly harms importers, {{as the cost of}} imported goods is inflated by the devaluation of the currency.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the amount}} of foreign {{reserves}} available to defend a <b>weak</b> <b>currency</b> (a currency in low demand) is limited, a currency crisis or devaluation could be the end result. For a currency in very high and rising demand, foreign exchange reserves can theoretically be continuously accumulated, if the intervention is sterilized through open market operations to prevent inflation from rising. On the other hand, this is costly, since the sterilization is usually done by public debt instruments (in some countries Central Banks {{are not allowed to}} emit debt by themselves).In practice, few central banks or currency regimes operate on such a simplistic level, and numerous other factors (domestic demand, production and productivity, imports and exports, relative prices of goods and services, etc.) will affect the eventual outcome. Besides that, the hypothesis that the world economy operates under perfect capital mobility is clearly flawed.|$|E
