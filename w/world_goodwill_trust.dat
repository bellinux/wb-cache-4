40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationships among}} management control systems (control extent, formal and social control mechanisms), inter-firm <b>trust</b> (<b>goodwill</b> and competence <b>trust)</b> and relational performance in Australian inter-organizational relationships (IORs). Using survey data from 232 Australian IORs, structure equation modelling (SEM) was applied to analyse direct and indirect (mediation and moderation) relationships. The analysis indicates {{that the use of}} tight controls and social control mechanisms are positively associated with <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust,</b> competence trust and relational performance. The use of formal controls is also positively related to <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and relational performance, although no direct association was found between formal controls and competence <b>trust.</b> Both <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and competence trust present strong positive associations with inter-organizational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the positive relationships between the use of tight controls and social controls, on one hand and relationship performance, on the other hand, are fully mediated by <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and competence trust. There were no mediation effects found for neither <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> nor competence trust on the direct positive relationship between formal controls and relational performance. <b>Goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and competence trust have different influences on the configuration of management control systems in IORs. Tight use of controls and social controls help with inter-firm trust-building and IOR performance through both <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and competence trust. Formal controls can both directly improve relationship performance and develop <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust,</b> but no evidence shows formal controls help in competence trust-building. 45 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims to empirically {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} competence and <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> on knowledge creation and the moderating effects of legal inadequacy on those relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from 196 research and development alliances in China. Hierarchical moderated regression {{was used to test}} the research hypotheses. Findings: We find that competence trust has a positive and linear relationship with knowledge creation while <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> has an inverted U-shaped relationship with it. The results also reveal that the inverted U-shaped relationship between <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and knowledge creation is stronger when legal inadequacy is high, while the impact of competence trust on knowledge creation is not influenced by legal inadequacy. Originality/value: The findings provide insights into the distinctive effects of competence and <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> on knowledge creation in partnerships, deepening current understandings of the bright and dark sides of inter-firm trust. This study also clarifies the influences of legal inadequacy on the effectiveness of competence and <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust,</b> which enhances existing knowledge about the impact of legal systems on the relationships between inter-firm trust and knoweldge management...|$|R

Results suggest that only three model propositions were not supported. <b>Goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> {{was not related to}} relational risks, whereas output control and social control were positively related to relational risks and performance risks, respectively. The relationship between trust and social control is complementary, whereas that for trust and output control is substitutive. <b>Goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> is positively related to perfor-mance risk taking. Also, output control undermines <b>goodwill</b> and competence <b>trust,</b> whereas social control enhances both types of <b>trust.</b> <b>Goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and competence trust are positively related to social control.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to know whether different dimensions of trust have different effects on local residents' acceptance of nuclear power plants (NPPs). In previous research such trust has been considered as a single dimensional concept. This paper divides <b>trust</b> into <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and competence trust, and we explore the ways in which trust affects acceptance of NPPs through structural equation modeling. A survey of 491 people was conducted in Haiyan County, China, where the Qinshan nuclear power plant is located. We find that <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> is significantly correlated with competence trust, and each can indirectly promote residents' acceptance of NPPs but by different paths. <b>Goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> improves acceptance of NPPs by decreasing risk perception, while competence trust improves acceptance of NPPs by increasing benefit perception.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} trust and control in managing organizational uncertainties, focusing on the significant role that the management accounting system can play in this relationship. While previous studies have often treated trust {{as part of the}} control system, this paper differentiates trust from control. However, the two remain closely related because information from the control system {{can also be used to}} assess levels of trust. Specifically, the paper examines the role that information from three types of control (output, behavioral, and social) plays in determining two types of <b>trust</b> (competency and <b>goodwill).</b> Competency <b>trust</b> and <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> are examined at the operational and executive levels, respectively, and in terms of information that builds as well as destroys trust. The findings from a case study of a joint venture between two international airlines indicate that controls produce information that reinforces competency trust at an operational level, but leaves <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> at an executive level relatively vulnerable to a betrayal of <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust.</b> The implications for the design of management accounting systems are discussed. 30 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{longitudinal}} {{case study of}} four interorganizational product development collaborations, this paper identifies a lure to cross-functional integration that has hereto been neglected. In particular, findings suggest that when the buyer firm separates the Research and Development (R&D) Department from the Procurement Department, the two departments play a good cop-bad cop strategy toward the supplier. Thereby, {{they are able to}} foster a high level of <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> between R&D personnel of the collaborating firms, while procurement personnel maintain a high level of formal control. Using an intricate sample design with polar cases, the study shows that cross-functional integration of the two departments hampers interorganizational <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> at the benefit of formal control.

40|$|Leveraging {{the supply}} chain for {{competitive}} resources remains a key challenge for supply chain management. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study examines SCM practices that help firms to acquire better supplier resources than rival firms that source from the same supplier. We provide {{a clearer picture of}} coercive and competence power, and <b>goodwill</b> and competence <b>trust</b> as key mechanisms to improve supplier resource allocation of physical and innovation resources. We analyze survey data of 185 supplying firms using structural equation modeling. Our analyses yield several interesting findings. First, contrary to other studies we find that coercive tactics do not necessarily affect supplier resource allocation negatively and <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> does not inherently affect supplier resource allocation positively. Second, the results of a multigroup analysis indicate that the dependence of a supplier on the buying firm – in terms of share in turnover – affects the relationship between the trust dimensions and supplier resource allocation more than it does the power dimensions. Third, <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> only affects supplier resource allocation when the buyer has a large share in the supplier's turnover, while competence trust is more effective if buyers account for a small share in the supplier's turnover. The contributions of our study for {{the supply chain}} management and social exchange theory literature are discusse...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the design of}} management control systems (MCS) in inter-organisational relationships (lOR). Adopting a contingency approach, the study aims to identify whether fit between lOR contextual variables and MCS design enhances lOR performance. This study conducted several statistical tests to examine the relationships between six lOR contextual variables and the design of MCS in lOR, and their effects on lOR performance. The contextual variables were buyer asset specificity, supplier asset specificity, task difficulty, task variability, <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> and competence trust, while the MCS design was conceptualised by the reliance on bureaucratic MCS. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire {{from a wide range}} of lOR in the Malaysian banking industry. The survey yielded 209 usable responses, which represented a 70 % response rate. The sample was divided into two groups according to lOR performance score. Three tests were then conducted, one for the entire sample, one for low-performing group and one for high-performing group. The results of the high-performing group were emphasised because it captures the fit between contextual variables and the appropriate MCS design. The results indicated that buyer asset specificity and competence trust had positive relationships with the reliance on bureaucratic MCS. In contrast, task difficulty and <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> had negative relationships with reliance on bureaucratic MCS. The two other contextual variables were found not significant with regards to influencing the variance of MCS design. There are several practical implications arising from the findings of this research project. The results support the notion of fit as suggested by the contingency approach. Thus, buyer organisations may increase the effectiveness of their lOR by using an appropriate MCS design. The results suggest that greater (lower) reliance on bureaucratic MCS, when buyer asset specificity and competence trust are high (low), and task difficulty and <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> are low (high), has a positive effect on lOR performance. In some circumstances, such as when tasks are highly difficult, the reliance on bureaucratic MCS may not lead to an enhanced lOR performance. Instead, social controls may be used to fill in the control gaps. Social controls emphasise the selection process to ensure that only trustworthy suppliers are selected for the jobs. A trusting relationship can be continually developed by regular interactions and reciprocity of exchanges in an open commitment environment. Unlike <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust,</b> the results suggest that competence trust and bureaucratic MCS has a complementary relationship. In other words, the reliance of bureaucratic MCS may not undermine competence trust. Thus, buyer organisations may rely on bureaucratic MCS to enhance lOR performance even when they have a high competence trust on their suppliers. Finally, this research project provides empirical evidence on the relationships between several lOR contextual variables and MCS design, and their effects on lOR performance. This research may enhance the generalisation of theory on the design of MCS in lOR...|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{business}} world, strategic alliances {{are becoming}} a common method for achieving a competitive advantage towards industry rivals. This tool, however, is not a guarantee for success as the failure rate of alliances is between 30 - 70 %. Even with this high failure rate, strategic alliances continue to grow and {{becoming more and more}} common. Through strategic alliances, the organizations can gain the possibility to access, acquire and implement new knowledge from its partners as a step to achieve competitive advantage. However, by engaging in alliances or inter-firm arrangements they also place themselves in the risk zone of giving away knowledge, both intentionally or unintentionally, which is also known as knowledge leakage. Studies have shown that trust is important in knowledge sharing, and managers must understand the role of trust and distrust in this equation, {{in order to be able}} to successfully achieve an effective and trustworthy knowledge transfer for a firm. Previous research has focused mainly on the effects of trust on knowledge sharing and a few exceptions have focused on knowledge leakage. However, these articles have been ignoring the factor of distrust. The purpose of this thesis therefore lies in investigating the effect the dimensions of both trust and distrust simultaneously have on knowledge sharing and leakage, as theory view trust and distrust as separate but co-existing concepts. The dimensions chosen for investigation are <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust,</b> competence <b>trust,</b> <b>goodwill</b> distrust and competence distrust. In order to achieve this purpose, a quantitative research method was used. A questionnaire was developed and sent out to Swedish firms operating in knowledge-intensive industries according to Eurostat. 55 companies fully completed the questionnaire. From this a factor analysis and regression analysis was conducted in order to fulfill the purpose of this thesis. This thesis found that <b>goodwill</b> <b>trust</b> has a positive effect on knowledge sharing and negative effect on knowledge leakage. Competence trust and competence distrust was found to have a positive relationship with knowledge leakage. Also, the authors developed the dimensions of goodwill and competence distrust as well as empirically proved their existence. This thesis contributes by acknowledging the importance of both concepts, trust and distrust, and also providing managers with an idea of what dimensions of trust and distrust are important when associating it to knowledge exchange. ...|$|R

Trust propensity refers to the trustor’s tendency to trust others and {{is more likely to}} be treated as a stable personal characteristic (Mayer et al., 1995; Das and Teng, 2004).
