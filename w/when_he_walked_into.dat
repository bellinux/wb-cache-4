25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury. The risk paid off; Walton's {{acquisition}} helped Boston win a league best 67 games. One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout. With averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards. In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals. Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round, leading Boston to victory in six games. The '86 Celtics are commonly ranked {{as one of the greatest}} basketball teams of all-time, with the Boston Globes Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.|$|E

2500|$|The résistant René Hardy {{had been}} {{seduced by the}} French Gestapo agent Lydie Bastien whose true loyalty was to her German lover, the Gestapo officer Harry Stengritt, and Hardy was arrested on 7 June 1943 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> a trap laid by Bastien. After his arrest, Hardy was [...] "turned" [...] by the Gestapo as Bastien tearfully {{told him that she}} and her parents would all be sent to a {{concentration}} camp if he did not work for the Gestapo and Hardy, unaware that Bastien really loathed him and was only sleeping with him under Stengritt's orders agreed to work for the Gestapo. On 9 June 1943, General Delestraint was arrested by the Gestapo following a tip-off provided by the double agent Hardy and was sent to the Dachau concentration camp.

60|$|One day {{the lawn}} had been mown, and the {{children}} where all very busy wheeling their little barrows, and loading them with the short grass; David was with them at first, but when Purday left off work, he marched after {{the old man in}} his grave deliberate way, and was seen no more till nearly tea-time, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the school-room with a very set look upon his solemn face, and sat himself down cross-legged on the locker, with a sigh that seemed {{to come out of the}} very depths of his heart.|$|E

Skellig picks the baby out of her cot and does as before: flies off the ground and spins around as the baby lies sleeping in his arms. This miraculously cures the baby, much to the family's delight. When Michael asks the baby's name, they tell him that they can't find the right one, and he suggests Grace. Baby Grace and her family go back to the house where her room is bright yellow; dad had been working on it while she was in hospital.

As he sat down by the old man's side, two tears--not tears like those with which recording angels blot their entries out, but drops so precious that they use them for their ink--stole down his meritorious cheeks.|$|E
60|$|It was two {{or three}} weeks later when Winston, being {{requested}} to do so, drove over to attend one of the assemblies at Silverdale Grange. It was dark when he reached the house, for the nights were drawing in, but because of the temperature few of the great oil lamps were lighted, and the windows were open wide. Somebody had just finished singing <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the big general room, and he would have preferred another moment to make his entrance, but disdained to wait. He, however, felt a momentary warmth in his face when Miss Barrington, stately as when he had first seen her in her rustling silk and ancient laces, came forward to greet him with her usual graciousness. He knew that every eye was upon them, and guessed why she had done so much.|$|E
