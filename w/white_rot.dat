5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, <b>white</b> <b>rot,</b> and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, <b>white</b> <b>rot,</b> and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereum is {{the single}} genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus {{currently}} comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause <b>white</b> <b>rot</b> in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies {{on the surface of}} infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing <b>white</b> <b>rot.</b> It moves towards the vertically aligned xylem. The vertical profile shows reddish and white streaks which run {{in the direction of}} growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>rots</b> {{break down}} lignin and {{cellulose}} and commonly cause rotted wood to feel moist, soft, spongy, or stringy and appear white or yellow.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Wood {{samples of}} Triplochiton scleroxylon and Gmelina arborea {{obtained}} from Omo Forest Reserve, South West Nigeria {{were treated with}} Heart wood extract of Teak (HWE), cuprinol clear and kerosene. The wood blocks were inoculated with 2 <b>white</b> <b>rots</b> Pleurotus squarrosullus and Lentinus subnundus for 12 weeks and subjected to weight loss experiment. Significant variations were found among wood blocks treated with chemical preservatives < 0. 05, with HWE performing best after 6 weeks after inoculation. Least weight loss was recorded at 6 weeks after inoculation. In particular, 4 % HWE was most effective of all preservative investigated. HWE was more effective in Gmelina arborea than in Triplochiton scleroxylon. Heart wood Extract of Teak reduced weight loss caused by <b>white</b> <b>rots</b> in two hardwood species. A significant variation however exists between wood species in their response to attack by the <b>white</b> <b>rots.</b> Specifically, weight loss reduced from 20 % to 4 % in T. scleroxylon and from 15 % to 5 % in G. arborea...|$|R
50|$|Schizoporaceae are {{a family}} of fungi in the order Hymenochaetales. These are saprobic, and cause <b>white</b> <b>rots</b> of {{standing}} and fallen wood of coniferous and broadleaved trees. According to one 2008 estimate, the family contains 14 genera and 109 species.|$|R
5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing <b>white</b> <b>rot.</b> The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} <b>white</b> <b>rot</b> in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus species cause a <b>white</b> <b>rot</b> by {{breaking}} down lignin in their tree hosts. The fungus infiltrates the heartwood {{of the tree}} via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or mistletoe, or by mechanical damage from logging. O.nidiformis has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri (Corymbia calophylla) in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (C.maculata) and messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) in New South Wales, and in blackbutt (E.pilularis), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), red stringybark (E.macrorhyncha) and Forth River peppermint (E.radiata) in Victoria.|$|E

40|$|The {{preventive}} {{control of}} <b>white</b> root <b>rot</b> disease in small holder plantation using botanical, biological, and chemical agents. A field and laboratory experiment were conducted from June 2008 to December 2009 in Panumangan, Tulang Bawang - Lampung. The field experiment {{was intended to}} evaluate the effect of botanical plants (Alpinia galanga, Sansiviera auranthii, and Marantha arundinacea), biological agents (organic matter and Trichoderma spp.), and chemical agents (lime and natural sulphur) on the incidence of <b>white</b> root <b>rot</b> disease and population of some soil microbes. The laboratory experiment was conducted to observe the mechanism of botanical agents in controlling <b>white</b> root <b>rot</b> disease. In the field experiment, the treatments were applied in the experimental plot with cassava plant infection as the indicator. The variables examined were the incidence of <b>white</b> root <b>rot</b> and population of soil microbes. In the laboratory experiment, culture of R. microporus was grown in PDA containing root exudate of the antagonistic plant (botanical agent). The variable examined was colony diameter of R. microporus growing in the PDA plates. The results of the field experiment showed that planting of the botanical agents, and application of Trichoderma spp., as well as natural sulphur, decreased the incidence of <b>white</b> root <b>rot</b> disease. The effectiveness of M. arundinacea and Trichoderma spp. was comparable to natural sulphur. The laboratory experiment showed only root exudate of A. galanga and S. auranthii that were significantly inhibit the growth of R. microporus...|$|R
5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes <b>white</b> <b>rot.</b> It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours the trunks of trees, where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing <b>white</b> <b>rot.</b> P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae are <b>white</b> <b>rot</b> pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin of {{the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E

50|$|Armillaria {{root rot}} is a fungal root rot caused by several {{different}} {{members of the}} genus Armillaria. The symptoms are variable depending on the host infected, ranging from stunted leaves to chlorotic needles and dieback of twigs and branches. However, all infected hosts display symptoms characteristic of being infected by a <b>white</b> <b>rotting</b> fungus. The most effective ways of management focus on limiting {{the spread of the}} fungus, planting resistant species, and removing infected material. This disease poses a threat to the lumber industry as well as affecting recreational areas.|$|R
5|$|The {{species has}} also been {{identified}} in living sapwood, though it is latent at this time, and {{it is probable that}} it waits until the wood begins to die (when it is drier, but contains more oxygen) before the mycelia begin to grow. When the species was inoculated into living wood, it did grow, but only around the inoculation wound; the species did not spread as it would have done on dead wood. Another study found that the species actively colonised partially living branches, causing <b>white</b> <b>rot.</b> However, the species had little effect on the cambium, and was mostly limited to the ends of branches.|$|E
5|$|<b>White</b> <b>rot</b> of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that {{produces}} a decay of sapwood. It causes <b>white</b> <b>rot,</b> a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light-colored residue. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups, sometimes in tiers, in the wounds of living trees. Its preferred host is willow, {{but it has also}} been found on birch and other hardwoods. Fruiting usually occurs from June to December, but the hard shelves can persist year-round. In North America, the species is most common in eastern locales, but rare in western regions. It is common in Europe, {{and is one of the}} 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom. Its European range extends east to the Urals. In Asia it is widely distributed, having been recorded from China, western Maharashtra (India), Iran, and Japan.|$|E

5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a <b>white</b> <b>rot</b> fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E
5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae grows {{upon the}} wood of {{deciduous}} trees and shrubs, favouring elder. In up to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder. It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (on living wood), and it causes <b>white</b> <b>rot.</b>|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the {{multitude}} of possible hosts, symptoms also range a great deal from one infection to another. All infected hosts do however display symptoms common to <b>white</b> <b>rotting</b> fungi. These include light or bleached wood as {{a result of}} the degradation of essential cell wall compounds such as lignin and hemicellulose. In addition to these, the host will show above-ground symptoms due to fungal infection of the vasculature. These include chlorosis in the needles as well as dieback of twigs and branches. The extent of these symptoms varies with the degree of infection as well as the susceptibility of the host. In addition to these symptoms, the trunks of conifers will also exude excess resin in a process known as resinopsis which results in a layer of resin, debris, and fungal tissue forming around infected roots. [...] Deciduous trees occasionally develop sunken cankers but most often fail to exhibit these symptoms on the trunk, and will instead simply display the other symptoms.|$|R
