5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{represented}} {{a huge number}} of available aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) was still recovering from losses suffered at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June. While units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time, pilot quality was in clear decline. Moreover, though the overall number of planes committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force that Japan had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of committing a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E

5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its thick frontal armour, {{flanking}} manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements.

5|$|At {{least two}} more ships joined the fleet {{in the early}} 1900s: Peterborough, which was {{acquired}} from the Shellharbour Steam Navigation Company, and Merimbula. At the time Merimbula was the company's finest vessel. She was a 1122-ton screw steamer which provided accommodation for 106 passengers (96 saloon and 10 second class) as well as possessing refrigerated cargo space, and she <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of between 13 and 14 knots. Unfortunately she ran aground off Beecroft Head in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing {{respected}} {{the discipline of}} the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, better suited to Americans.

General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the Army of the James, when Lee surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long {{and capable of}} carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat lifts, the earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK. The lifts predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} decades Hines drifted between jobs and countries, including spending {{three years in}} the King's Liverpool Regiment and serving as a guide in the Second Boer War, before arriving in Australia in mid-1914.

5|$|From early 1942 Tirpitz posed a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} Allied convoys transporting supplies through the Norwegian Sea to the Soviet Union. Operating from fjords on the Norwegian coast, the battleship <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic. To counter this threat, the Allies were forced to keep a powerful force of warships with the British Home Fleet, and capital ships accompanied most convoys {{part of the way}} to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Louis Faidherbe, the {{governor}} of Senegal, inaugurated the Bouteville boat that <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> of transporting 150 passengers, animals {{and all kinds of}} goods. The boat made ten crosses every day and the fares differed: five centimes for a person, 50 centimes for a horse, cow or camel, and two francs for a carriage. In less than a year it was obvious that this system was overrun and a second boat was introduced but with no success.|$|E
