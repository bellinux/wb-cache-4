Dormer purchased several manors, including Long Crendon, which he bought from Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset in 1520, and the manor of Hughenden, which he purchased from the Crown for £387 in 1539 after the last Prior of Kenilworth had surrendered it during the dissolution of the monasteries.|$|E
40|$|Stable carbon isotope {{analyses}} of <b>wool</b> <b>staples</b> provided {{insight into the}} vegetation consumed by sheep at a temporal resolution not previously studied. Contemporary Australian and historic South African samples dating back to 1916 were analyzed for their stable carbon isotope ratio, a proxy for the proportion of C- 3 and C- 4 plant species consumed by animals. Sheep sample vegetation continuously throughout a year, and as their wool grows it integrates and stores information about their diet. In subtropical and tropical rangelands the majority of grass species are C- 4. Since sheep prefer to graze, and their wool is an isotopic record of their diet, {{we now have the}} potential to develop a high resolution index to the availability of grass from a sheep 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. Isotopic {{analyses of}} wool suggest a new direction for monitoring grazing and for the reconstruction of past vegetation changes, which will make a significant contribution to traditional rangeland ecology and management. It is recommended that isotopic and other analyses of wool be further developed for use in rangeland monitoring programs to provide valuable feedback for land managers...|$|R

The model is based on a number of fundamental characteristics of the Australian wool industry and the staple-strength enhancing technology being assessed.

On-farm, there is documented evidence that including handle assessment in a selection index provides additional improvements in genetic gain. However, the assessment of greasy wool handle is based on a tactile evaluation of the <b>wool</b> <b>staple</b> by sheep and wool classers, and its application is affected by a lack of framework that instructs assessors on a standard method of assessment.

50|$|The Whitefaced Woodland {{is one of}} {{the largest}} hill breeds, with ewes {{sometimes}} weighing more the 60 kg (132 lbs) when kept in lowland pastures.

40|$|Effects of {{electromagnetic}} fields on the meat performance and wool performance of sheep The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on ewes were determined in two experiments. The ewes {{were exposed to}} the fields twice daily, for 12 minutes, in a pen covered with flat coils generating a PEMF at a frequency of 33 Hz, with magnetic induction ranging from about 3. 5 µT at the floor to about 92 µT {{on the surface of the}} coils. Experiment 1 was performed on ewes aged 4 to 9 months. The following parameters were analysed: body weight, daily gains, cross-section measurements of the dorsal muscle (musculus longissimus dorsi- m. l. d.), thickness of the fat layer over the loin eye, greasy <b>wool</b> production, <b>staple</b> length, staple thickness and staple strength, as well as hematological and biochemical blood indices and acid-base equilibrium parameters. Experiment 2 was conducted on adult ewes during 70 -day lactation, and their wool performance was determined, like in experiment 1. It was found that PEMF had a significant and positive effect on the body weights and daily gains of growing ewes, and on the depth and cross-section area of m. l. d. This could be a consequence of the stabilizing effect of PEMF on metabolic processes, as suggested by lower AST activity, lower concentrations of creatinine and urea, as well as increased oxygen supply to cells confirmed by a lower oxygen saturation percentage (O 2 SAT). No direct correlations were found between exposure to PEMF and <b>wool</b> performance, <b>staple</b> length and <b>wool</b> quality traits...|$|R

40|$|In the field, {{we found}} that lamb {{mortality}} was lower (P < 0. 01) in a flock selected for <b>wool</b> <b>staple</b> strength (SS+) than in a flock selected against staple strength (SS-), or a random-bred control flock (R); mortality rates calculated from 4200 records were 17. 0, 22. 8, and 24. 1 %, respectively. The proportion of twins was similar in all flocks, but birth weights differed (P < 0. 01), being 4. 40, 4. 25, and 4. 14 kg, respectively. Biochemical profiles were measured in lambs from 20 ewes from each flock {{around the time of}} birth in an animal-house study, to define potential causes of the genetic difference in survival. In the intensive study, birth weight was similar for all groups; however, gestation length was slightly shorter in the SS+ lambs (P < 0. 05 for SS+ v. R). All lambs had low plasma concentrations of the essential amino acids and glucose at birth, compared with after suckling. Plasma concentrations of glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at birth differed between lambs from the flocks with the greatest difference in mortality (i. e. SS+ v. R); that is, SS+ lambs had higher concentrations of glucose (1. 84 v. 1. 23 mM; P < 0. 01) and NEFA (1. 52 v. 1. 08 mM; P < 0. 05), and lower concentrations of BUN (7. 7 v. 9. 7 mM; P < 0. 01) at birth, and for the next 9 h. The semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscle of the SS+ lambs also had lower concentrations of ATP (7. 4 v. 5. 0 μmol/g, respectively) compared with lambs from the other flocks, immediately post-partum. Muscle phosphocreatinine was also slightly lower in the SS+ lambs. No differences between the genotypes were observed in reserves of glycogen, carcass fat, brown adipose tissue, or in neonatal thyroid hormones. In summary, sheep selected for high <b>wool</b> <b>staple</b> strength had lower lamb mortality than the other 2 flocks. This was accompanied by metabolic differences at birth that can be associated with greater metabolic maturity, rather than greater energy reserves...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the skin comfort and handle properties {{of a range of}} wool fabrics produced from ultrafine wool (13. 7 – 15. 1 µm) and in doing so determine if differences in fiber diameter and staple crimp frequency (5. 3 – 7. 1 crimps/cm) were important in these properties. The fabrics were evaluated using a range of subjective and objective measurement techniques, including the Wool ComfortMeter, the Wool HandleMeter and in wearer trials. This work indicated that single jersey fabrics made from ultrafine wool are approaching the limit of objective and subjective evaluation of next-to-skin comfort. The results from the Wool ComfortMeter, Wool HandleMeter and the wearer trial show that there were no significant effects that can be attributed to <b>wool</b> <b>staple</b> crimp (fiber curvature) in these ultrafine wool fabrics. The work also demonstrated a difference in the manufacturing response when knitted fabric made from wools of different fiber diameter (13. 7 – 23. 7 µm), and using yarns of the same count, resulted in a progressively higher fabric mass per unit area as mean fiber diameter was progressively reduced...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{variation}} in fibre diameter during the wool growing season derived using optical fibre diameter analysis (OFDA 2000) {{can be used}} to predict <b>wool</b> <b>staple</b> strength. Information on fibre diameter {{can also be used to}} initiate nutritional management strategies for preventing wool tenderness and the associated price reduction. However, OFDA 2000 measurements involve costs associated with the collection of mid-side wool samples and laboratory analyses. In addition, the information is retrospective, as results are usually obtained too late for feeding and management interventions. We investigated the use of real-time pasture availability data obtained using satellite imaging to predict fibre diameter profile and staple strength. Correlations between pasture availability and changes in fibre diameter were strong, but varied between environments. In general, the rate of reduction in pasture availability was moderately correlated with the reduction in fibre diameter; on average it accounted for 28 % of the {{variation in}} fibre diameter, and in some environments it accounted for up to 75 % of the variation in fibre diameter. The decrease in pasture availability was positively correlated with staple strength and accounted for 26 % of the variation in staple strength. The use of satellite-derived pasture availability estimates in feeding strategies designed to prevent wool tenderness is discussed, as is the potential of satellite data for predicting regional staple strength changes...|$|E
