5|$|On 20 February 1941, No. 4 Commando <b>were</b> <b>informed</b> {{they would}} be going to Troon in Scotland for an exercise. The next day the unit boarded HMS Queen Emma, but on 22 February 1941, after they {{anchored}} at Scapa Flow, their real objective was divulged.

Giovanni Albani, who had drafted the bull outlawing nepotism, soon became the leading candidate for the papacy.|$|E

5|$|We <b>were</b> <b>informed</b> of the {{prospect}} of a shortening in food rations. 300 grams of meat or sausage per week. Once the Führer asserted he had the right to require sacrifices because he himself was ready to accept any personal sacrifice.

5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, {{most of whom were}} arrested within two weeks. The police <b>were</b> <b>informed</b> that the final two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire took control. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that a physician only {{needs to do}} what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care). However, {{in the case of}} informed consent, the legal standard is more commonly defined as what a reasonable patient would elect to do if she <b>is</b> <b>informed.</b> So if a reasonable patient would want to be screened if only she <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> or if a reasonable patient would want to receive an amniocentesis if only she <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> of that option, then a physician is legally obligated to inform the patient of these options.|$|R

5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis <b>were</b> <b>informed</b> by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} {{appointed}} to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E
5|$|By late {{afternoon}} Béxar {{was occupied by}} about 1,500 Mexican soldiers. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon. Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but <b>were</b> <b>informed</b> that any surrender must be unconditional. On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers <b>were</b> <b>informed</b> that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
