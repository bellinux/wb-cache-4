5|$|In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly posted that The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{deserved}} to be released on DVD. Gord Lacey, {{the creator of the}} website TVShowsonDVD.com, told the New York Daily News that Brisco was among the five most requested shows on the site. Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get Brisco released on DVD. This led to correspondence with Cuse, who also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> DVD set produced. On July 18, 2006, Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series. The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse; an interactive menu of Brisco's signature references narrated by Campbell; The History of Brisco County, Jr., documentary; a feature called A Reading from the Book of Bruce; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show.|$|E

He received a Commonwealth scholarship and went to Imperial College London, where he studied meteorology instead of physics for the fear that physics would lead to wars.

However, he had only studied at Princeton University for three weeks before dropping out, saying that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job instead of studying theories.|$|E

[...] The {{first thing he did}} was join the Territorial Army for six months. Although he enjoyed his time in the TA, Dickinson {{realised}} {{that it was not a}} career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London. His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> degree first, which acted as his [...] "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, {{it is part of}} a series where the band are taking photos with photographers in different cities they end up in. On the band's blog, they mention the series of photos as 'imaginary crime scenes, invaded by the photographer', and 'a slice of night frozen by flash'.|$|E

Once all interpretations were complete, [...] "they [...] took parts of The Writing Camp version, parts of Ester Dean's version, and parts of another version, and they put them together, and then Nicole [...] and Ron [...] filled in the blanks that they thought were missing". Bogart additionally stated that it was [...] "a very unique and awkward way of writing a song". Bogart, Dean, Fair, Erika Nuri, David Quiñones, Scherzinger, Candace Thorbourne, Nailah Thorbourne and Nyanda Thorbourne are credited for writing the track, while its production was handled by Fair Scherzinger. The song was recorded in London, while Scherzinger and Rahman corresponded via webcam.|$|E

500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade wrote a {{draft of}} a remake of the 1969 British crime comedy The Italian Job which was {{rejected}} by Paramount. Screenwriting team Donna and Wayne Powers were subsequently commissioned to write a remake. The duo viewed the original film, which neither had seen before, only once [...] "because [...] <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{sense of what it}} was about" [...] in regards to its tone. Over the course of two years and through 18 drafts, they developed a screenplay which was described by director F. Gary Gray as [...] "inspired by the original." [...] Gray, Powers and Powers, and executive producer James Dyer identified the most prominent similarities as the trio of Mini Coopers used by the thieves, as well as the titular heist involving the theft of gold bullion. Some sequences of the film were storyboarded and previsualized by Gray before production began.|$|E
500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little bit more of that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E

Rootes felt that Zutaut was [...] "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists." [...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff like that. I did vocals at different times. But we really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> live sound." [...] The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Deaf Havana were {{originally}} a five-piece band, incorporating screaming vocals in their music, as demonstrated on their previous work Meet Me Halfway, at Least. Shortly {{after the release}} of this album, vocalist and founding member Ryan Mellor left the band, citing personal reasons, leaving the group without a screamer. It was decided that Mellor would not be replaced; clean vocalist James Veck-Gilodi would become the sole vocalist and act as the band's frontman. This led to a change in the musical style of the group; they moved away from post-hardcore which had characterised their earlier releases towards pop punk and power pop. A demo track, titled [...] "My Life Is Average", showcasing their new, lighter sound, was uploaded to the band's Myspace page shortly after Ryan's departure. In an interview, Veck-Gilodi explained, 'We didn't want to announce Ryan had left, and then have months off, for people to wonder what we were doing. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> song out there with just me singing... so people could hear our new sound'.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Gregg [...] "Opie" [...] Hughes was {{the host}} of The Nighttime Attitude, a late night music radio show on WBAB on Long Island, New York. In an effort to {{capitalize}} on the extensive media coverage of the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, Hughes held a song parody contest for listeners to submit entries based on the trial. Among the thirty or so submissions that he received, one of them was [...] "Gonna Electric Shock O.J." [...] to the tune of [...] "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" [...] by Otis Redding, performed by Rotgut, a local band featuring Anthony Cumia, a construction worker, on vocals and his brother Joe. The latter travelled to the station while Hughes was doing his show to submit a cassette tape of the parody, and only allowed Hughes to take it. The parody became a hit with the audience, who asked for the song to be played each night. As a result, Hughes invited the Cumias to perform the song live in the studio. Recalled Hughes, [...] "Ant and I instantly had each other the rest of the show. I was like, 'Holy shit, dude. That went pretty well. Why don't you come in next week?' Slowly but surely, he started coming in every week". Using the little funds available at the radio station, Hughes secured a small budget for Cumia to be paid for his appearances, though to Cumia, the money was not an issue as he [...] "just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> foot in the door" [...] in radio.|$|E
