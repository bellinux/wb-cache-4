5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff.

There was nothing more they could do for the Commandos, so they headed out to sea. On their <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> continuously illuminated by German searchlights and were hit at least six times by the German guns.

5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to bring home his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book {{that for the first time}} brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E

5|$|This brought Kenney into {{conflict}} with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify {{the administration of the}} RAAF. Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command, and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> However, Kenney deviated from the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) under Whitehead. The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area, where fast-changing weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia. Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy {{casualties}} {{during the}} initial attack, the Germans were able to land reinforcements and {{the situation on the}} island quickly deteriorated for the Allies. The brigade had abandoned its initial positions and moved to a new location to the west of Galatas to eliminate the threat that it would become separated from the 5th Infantry Brigade. On 25 May, the 18th Battalion had to deal with a full-scale attack by Fallschirmjäger. This caused heavy casualties and a large portion of one of the battalion's companies was captured. Despite reinforcements arriving from the 20th Battalion and the best efforts of Gray in rounding up stragglers, the Galatas position was breached and the township captured. Some battalion personnel, led by Gray, along with the bulk of the 23rd Battalion, participated in an attack that briefly re-took the township but it later had to be abandoned again after further fighting. The battalion was then withdrawn to the east as the order to evacuate Crete was received, making its way towards Suda Bay, where Allied ships were taking troops off the beaches. Along the <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> subjected to heavy air raids, one of which killed a company commander, Captain Jack Lyon, the Member of Parliament for the Waitemata electorate.|$|E
