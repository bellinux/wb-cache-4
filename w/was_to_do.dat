In 1922, the office of General Secretary followed as a purely administrative and disciplinary position, whose role <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> no more than determine party membership composition. Stalin, its first incumbent, used the principles of democratic centralism to transform his office into that of party leader, and later leader of the Soviet Union.|$|E

He also wrote an oratorio, Gideon, as the exercise for his doctorate and it was performed in November 1865.

5|$|The first XF-104 (Lockheed 083-1001, s/n 53-7786) was {{transported to}} Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy {{during the night}} of 24–25 February, where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the initial testing. On 28 February 1954, the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a {{high-speed}} taxi, but its first official flight took place on 4 March. During that flight, the landing gear did not retract, and LeVier landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes. Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system. Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March, when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} The Pee-wee Herman Show {{prompted}} Warner Bros. to hire Reubens {{to write a}} script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a remake of Pollyanna, which Reubens claims is his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a bike with them, which inspired Reubens to start on a new script with Phil Hartman. When Reubens and the producers of Pee-wee's Big Adventure saw Tim Burton's work on Vincent and Frankenweenie, they chose Burton to be the film's director. The film {{tells the story of}} Pee-wee Herman embarking on nationwide adventure in search of his stolen bicycle. The movie went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically, recouping almost six times its $7 million budget. At the time of release in 1985, the film received mixed reviews, but Pee-wee's Big Adventure developed into a cult film.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the major}} party candidates, Weaver {{planned to take}} the field himself, giving speeches around the country. His running mate, Chambers, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same, until a fall from a train in July {{disabled}} him {{for the duration of}} the campaign. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, he hoped to make inroads in that region. Weaver's path to victory, already unlikely, was made more difficult by his refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans. His party's message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in the South, as the Greenbackers would face the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|Juan de San Buenaventura's {{small group}} of Franciscans had arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695, {{and found that the}} army had opened the road southwards for another {{seventeen}} leagues (approximately 44.2miles or 71.1km), almost half way to Lake Petén Itzá, but returned to Chuntuki due to the seasonal rains. San Buenaventura was accompanied by friar Joseph de Jesús María, lay friar Tomás de Alcoser and lay brother Lucas de San Francisco. With Avendaño's return to Mérida, provincial superior Antonio de Silva despatched two additional friars to join San Buenaventura's group: Diego de Echevarría and Diego de Salas. One of these was to convert the Kejache in Tzuktok', and the other <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same at Chuntuki. Although initially reluctant to permit the group to continue into Itza territory, by late October García de Paredes had relented and acquiesced to de Silva's instructions for San Buenaventura and his original companions to continue to Nojpetén, although it appears that this never happened. On 24 October San Buenaventura wrote to the provincial superior reporting that the warlike Kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that the Itza were ready to receive the Spanish in friendship. On that day 62 Kejache men had voluntarily come to Chuntuki from Pak'ek'em, where another 300 Kejache resided. San Buenaventura sent lay brother Lucas de San Francisco to convince them to relocate to the Chuntuki mission. Lucas de San Francisco destroyed the idols in Pak'ek'em but the inhabitants were not brought to the mission because of worries about feeding the new arrivals. Instead, in early November 1695, friar Tomás de Alcoser and brother Lucas de San Francisco were sent to establish a mission at Pak'ek'em, where they were well received by the cacique and his pagan priest. Pak'ek'em was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at B'atkab' to attend to over 100 K'ejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of friar Diego de Echevarría; a further church was established at Tzuktok', overseen by Diego de Salas.|$|E
