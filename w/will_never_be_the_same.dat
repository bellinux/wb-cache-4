This stone can be transformed only by taking from it, when a piece splinters off, say, never by growing. By placing these two objects side by side, the proportionality of the monument's two parts <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E

500|$|However, the British film {{industry}} was entering {{a period of}} decline, and none of Newman's projects ever went into production. ABPC {{was taken over by}} EMI, {{and at the end of}} June 1969, Newman was dismissed from the company, later describing his eighteen months there as [...] "a futile waste." [...] Despite being offered an executive producership by the BBC, keen to regain his services on the very day he left ABPC, Newman decided to return to Canada. He left the UK on January 3, 1970, leading The Sunday Times to comment that [...] "British television <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> again." ...|$|E

500|$|The BBC Four revival {{beginning}} in 2005 with A View from a Hill was greeted warmly by Sarah Dempster, who {{stated that the}} programme was, [...] "in every respect, a vintage Ghost Story for Christmas production. There are the powdery academics hamstrung by extreme social awkwardness. There is the bumbling protagonist bemused by a particular aspect of modern life. There are stunning, panoramic shots of a specific area of the British landscape (here, a heavily autumnal Suffolk). There is the determined lack of celebrity pizzazz. There is tweed. And there is, crucially, a single moment of heart-stopping, corner-of-the-eye horror that suggests life, for one powdery academic at least, <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> again." ...|$|E

[...] When asked if O'Malley was becoming more assertive, Knight said: [...] Knight also commented that the character does not appreciate himself and his positive traits. On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs {{to be kind of}} kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the {{references}} to Illuminatus! and themselves were in keeping with Drummond and Cauty's tradition, this was also in part {{intended to be a}} self-parodying dredge of The KLF's [...] "myth". [...] Drummond's opinions of the [...] "rock 'n' roll comeback" [...] were recorded by him at the time and aired in 2000: [...] "The history of rock 'n' roll has been littered with pathetic comebacks.... No comeback has ever worked. The motivation behind the comeback has never and <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as when the group or artist first crawled out of their sub-cult.... If there was fresh original talent, it is now tired and tested, only capable of flicking the nostalgia switch." [...] Designing 2K's parody of the comeback, Drummond wrote that he and Cauty were [...] "getting totally into the institution of The Comeback, drawing on the sad, pathetic nature of the whole thing, the desperation of all concerned to exploit whatever they can from the myth...".|$|E

There’s nothing George and Meredith can do. The damage is done – things <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> They’ve just changed something important in their lives FOREVER and…they are freaking out." [...] Grey's character development has also been known as an influence {{on the creation of}} her half-sister, Lexie Grey. Particularly, it has been made clear that they both share the same motives. McKee offered her thoughts: [...] "Meredith and Lexie both want to succeed. They want to be strong. They want to feel normal. They want, so much, to be whole. But it’s a struggle – a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it." [...] Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's.

500|$|Opening night {{reviews of}} the musical were {{strongly}} positive. [...] Richard Watts in the New York Post termed it [...] "nother triumph for the masters". Critic John Mason Brown stated, [...] "They have done it again." [...] The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: [...] "This time Messrs. Rodgers and Hammerstein are not breaking any fresh trails, but they are accomplished artists of song and words in the theater; and The King and I is a beautiful and lovable musical play." [...] Barely less enthusiastic was John Lardner in The New Yorker, who wrote, [...] "Even {{those of us who}} find [...] a little too unremittingly wholesome are bound to take pleasure in the high spirits and technical skill that their authors, and producers, have put into them." [...] Otis Guernsey wrote for the New York Herald Tribune, [...] "Musicals and leading men <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> after last night...

The song is played in the time signature of common time in the key E minor, with Jackson's vocal range spanning from the tonal nodes of E4 to Bb5. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] has a moderate tempo of 95 [...] beats per minute. The chord progression in the song is Em7–C9-Bm7–Am7–D–Em7. The song's composition {{has been compared to}} Jackson's previous material with Quincy Jones from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the disco-theme from Jackson's 1979 single, [...] "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". Chris Tucker voices the vocal introduction of the song while all the instruments heard on the track were played by Jackson and Rodney Jerkins. Lyrically, the song's lyrics are about being in love, as well as the effect that it can have, as evident in the opening line, [...] "My life <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> 'cause, girl, you came and changed the way I walk, the way I talk, I cannot explain".|$|E

2500|$|The {{death of}} a spouse is usually a {{particularly}} powerful loss.

[...] The grief experience is unique to each person.
