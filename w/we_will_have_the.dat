2500|$|Vinge's 1993 article [...] "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era", spread widely on the {{internet}} and helped to popularize the idea. This article contains the statement, [...] "Within thirty years, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended." [...] Vinge argues that science-fiction authors cannot write realistic post-singularity characters who surpass the human intellect, as the thoughts of such an intellect would be beyond the ability of humans to express.|$|E

2500|$|The {{religious}} aims of {{the rebellion}} were highlighted in the slogan [...] "Kill all the gentlemen and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Six Articles up again, and ceremonies {{as they were in}} King Henry's time." [...] However, it also implies a social cause (a view supported by historians such as Guy and Fletcher). [...] That later demands included limiting the size of households belonging to the gentry – theoretically beneficial in a time of population growth and unemployment – possibly suggests an attack on the prestige of the gentry. [...] Certainly such contemporaries as Thomas Cranmer took this view, condemning the rebels for deliberately inciting a class conflict by their demands: [...] "to diminish their strength and to take away their friends, that you might command gentlemen at your pleasures". Protector Somerset himself saw dislike of the gentry as a common factor in all of the 1549 rebellions: [...] "indeed all hath conceived a wonderful hate against the gentlemen and taketh them all as their enemies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first act}} on stage was Velvet, {{performing}} [...] "The Queen". Velvet begins the {{performance in a}} gigantic pink dress, which opens up to reveal seven backing dancers in Commedia dell'arte dress. The stage was filled with smoke and shone pink.

The stage was filled to capacity, with two lead singers, a pianist, drummer, guitarist, saxophonist and two female backing singers. The next act on stage was Molly Sandén, who represented Sweden in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2006 with [...] "Det finaste någon kan få".

[...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, {{we are going to}} have a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?"
