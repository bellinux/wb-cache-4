5|$|Meanwhile, Tate, {{still in}} love with Violet, is {{concerned}} that she is lonely. He attempts to kill Gabriel Ramos (Brennan Mejia), thinking he might be a better boyfriend for Violet, but she stops Tate, and gives him a goodbye kiss, allowing the boy to escape. Gabriel and his family flee the home, while the Harmons happily <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> drive off.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted {{people to think about}} the future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to <b>watch</b> <b>them.</b> By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E
5|$|By war's end, Black Hawk and {{nineteen}} {{other leaders}} of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, and three others were transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners. The American public was eager {{to catch a glimpse}} of the captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in Louisville and Cincinnati to <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> pass. On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in Washington, D.C., before being taken to Fort Monroe. Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as Charles Bird King and John Wesley Jarvis, and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.|$|E

5|$|CenturyLink Field is also {{designed}} for soccer. The first sporting event held included a United Soccer Leagues (USL) Seattle Sounders match. The USL team began using the stadium regularly for home games in 2003. The MLS expansion team Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. CenturyLink Field {{was the site}} of the MLS Cup in 2009. The venue also hosted the 2010 and 2011 tournament finals for the U.S. Open Cup. Sounders FC won both times and new attendance records were set each year it was hosted at CenturyLink Field. In August 2013, the Sounders broke a new home field attendance record when 67,385 fans turned out to <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> play the Portland Timbers.|$|E
5|$|Gardiner {{was born}} in Edinburgh, Scotland to John and Janet Gardiner. The fourth of five children, there was also Gardiner's two older brothers, John and Alexander, an older sister, Edith, and a younger sister, Christina. In 1911, when Gardiner was seven, he {{and the rest of}} his family emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba. The family {{initially}} lived in a house on William Avenue before relocating to Alexander Street; both streets were south of the railways, and were full of Scottish-Irish working-class families. John took a job as a rail car repairer, and Gardiner took an early interest in the trains, often waiting up late at night to <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> arrive into the city. He was enrolled at the Albert School, and befriended Wilf Cude, who had immigrated from Wales who would also go on to be a National Hockey League (NHL) goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him to tell a joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E
5|$|In 406 BC Alcibiades set {{out from}} Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take Andros {{and then he went}} on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the enemy at Ephesus. In the {{meanwhile}} Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus the Younger (son of Darius II of Persia) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with Lysander, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet {{at the expense of the}} Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> under the command of his personal helmsman Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different from that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus's ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.|$|E
