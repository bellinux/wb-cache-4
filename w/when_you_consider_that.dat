[...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning {{end of the world}} sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also {{having a lot of fun}} with the jokes.

500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!".

2500|$|Morricone finally {{received}} a second Oscar nomination for The Mission. Morricone's original score lost out to Herbie Hancock's coolly arranged jazz on Bertrand Tavernier's Round Midnight.

Morricone stated the following during a 2001 interview with The Guardian: [...] "I definitely felt that I should have won for The Mission.

40|$|The recent {{effort by}} the Nigerian Central Bank to merge banks, sorely {{with the aim of}} {{increasing}} shareholders confidence and improved performance, triggered this study. Therefore, the paper measures and decomposes efficiency using the non-parametric approach popularly known as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and productivity growth using Malmquist Productivity index (MPI), in a sample of Nigerian commercial banks over the period of 5 years. Net fixed assets and total deposits were used as the input variables while total loans and advances, other earning assets and net operating income were used as the output variables. Under the Constant Return to Scale assumption, the average efficiency of all the banks over the 5 -year period showed a constant improvement. Although the efficiency improvement in the 3 rd year seems low, on the average over the years considered the results of all the banks consistently showed improvements. When we considered the variable return to scale we found the efficiency score to still maintain the score significance, although slightly lower in some instances. It is the recommendation of the paper that banks need to do more in terms of maintaining their level of efficiency, especially, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> the fact <b>that</b> they have merged with other banks that have somewhat different level of performance and productivity efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{area that}} {{rightfully}} {{gets a lot}} of attention in our everyday life is how to monitor and control our spending. The Federal Government through the Central Bank of Nigeria is proposing that most expenditure be done using a cashless option. The challenge with adopting the cashless options for transactions is the susceptibility to overspending. This issue becomes more serious <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> the fact <b>that</b> many citizenss lack focus and control {{and are more likely to}} be affected. Apart from this, their financial literacy is quite low. Studies have shown that it is very easy to spend more than what your budget allows <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are not counting out the actual cash and seeing the hard earned money leave your hands. Merely controlling how to use cash is not an effective strategy to control overspending, there is need to use develop and use a flexible strategy to monitor and control our expenditures, and get report on transactions that may lead to overspending. In this paper, we propose a set of flexible strategies for monitoring and controlling overspending among citizens in a cashless society. This proposed set of strategies will be anchored on a triple-A philosophy- (1) Arrange; (2) Acquire; and (3) Appraise. These strategies are presented in such a way that it can be applied by single persons as well as small to medium size businesses. These strategies when applied will help citizens to monitor and control their spending habits...|$|R
5000|$|Feminism in the Narodnik {{movement}} was also {{hard for the}} peasantry to accept. Pre-Marxist revolutionaries believed in an unusually strong equality of sex, and educated noblewomen played major roles in radical movements in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. Russian revolutionary literature in the 1840s and 1850s linked the causes of emancipation of serfs with the emancipation of the Russian woman—this literature was manifest in the Narodnik movement. The Narodniks promulgated Chernyshevskyan ideas of chaste cohabitation—that men and women should live together with no sexual interactions—and gender equality. These concepts were extremely odd to most peasants, {{and they did not}} generally react well to them. Furthermore, Narodniks often lived in communes where non-married men and women slept and lived in the same rooms. To Orthodox Russian peasants in the 1870s, such disregard of gender norms were both offensive and off-putting. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> the fact <b>that</b> nearly 60% of Narodnik women were from wealthy classes it becomes clear why the Russian peasant could not relate to most intellectuals in the movement intellectually, economically or socially. [...] Historian Dmitri Pisarev writes that “sensing their inability to act alone, the intelligent radical made the peasantry the instrument to realize their hopes.” The peasants did not readily welcome being a vessel for the revolutionaries. The Narodniks believed that the peasants were the class in Russia most prone to revolution, yet the peasants were not ready for revolutionary action.|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{comparison}} {{according to the}} ideological thoughts about womens position in the society of Mao Zedong och Josef Stalin. The material I have analysed is writings by Mao and Stalin, {{in a wide range}} from leaflets to orders to the armies of the states of China and the Soviet Union. The method I have used is an ideological analysis where the attitude towards women is the target for my survey. The attitude towards women generally was not unified in the world during the time for Mao and Stalin. In many countries the women was intended {{to take care of the}} children and the home, not be active in working and fighting. That was something for the men. Although, in the socialistic ideology, the attitude towards women were different. They were expected to work, and did this in China and the Sovjet Union. In the same way Mao and Stalin thought. Both of the leaders <b>considered</b> <b>that</b> women should take part of the work for socialism, both before and after the dates when this ideology came to be government in the both countries. Much of the ideology is alike between the two leaders.

The entire history of the comics is extraordinary. —Scott Derrickson, director of Doctor Strange In June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film. He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the astral plane while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic Doctor Strange: The Oath. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an animatic, which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an [...] "obnoxious amount" [...] of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove [...] "that I wanted job more than anyone", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct Doctor Strange than any of their other films. Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film. After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces. On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, [...] "It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use [...] "real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... to encounter the fantastical", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for Doctor Strange through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.|$|R
