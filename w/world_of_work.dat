25|$|The {{intensity}} of integration with the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> (which includes enterprise, {{civil society and}} the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning.

25|$|According to Clayton Christensen, {{disruptive}} innovation {{is the key}} to future success in business. The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity. The <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced {{to reduce the number of}} people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.|$|E

This {{study found that the}} most effective programs for young people provide sustained adult contact. [...] Results indicate that the most effective strategies for keeping young people in school are those that build bridges to the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> while young people are still in school. The most effective strategies were found to combine a training component with strong links to the employer community, more formal training linked to on-the-job training and work experience, and job search assistance and transitional wage subsidies (HRDC June 1997). [...] There is some evidence that co-operative education programs lead to improved employment outcomes in post-secondary school although the number of work experience placements offered by employers is quite limited.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of Heidegger’s Being and Time is human {{existence}} in a secular world (Dasein) {{after the death of}} God. Heidegger starts with our involvement with tools in everyday <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> (in the kitchen using a coffee machine) and play (in the gym wearing running shoes) and asks how the being of a human being (the “essence” of “existence”) is different from the being of the “equipment” that we are actually using or the being of a “thing” that is merely being perceived. In Being and Time, these everyday <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and play are presumed by Heidegger to be independent of modern technology. The first part of the course explores the ontological answers Heidegger gives in Being and Time to these questions. The second part of the course starts with human being in a secular world dominated by modern technology and reexamines Heidegger's conclusions in Being and Time about the "essence" of human "existence" and related matters...|$|R
