5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending, written {{at a time}} women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E
5|$|Animated {{television}} advertisements starring the transgender playboy cow Graham Heffer {{ran from}} 1999 until 2002. The adverts attracted complaints {{from the public}} for allegedly promoting bestiality, homosexuality and drug-taking. Boddingtons become an official partner of the 2002 XVII Commonwealth Games held in Manchester in a deal worth at least £1million. To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer's Manchester heritage <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Happy</b> Mondays soundtrack, even though production had {{moved out of the}} city. Mike Thompson, a former worker at the brewery and representative of the Transport & General Workers' Union, said: This is at best cynical and at worst a slur on our great city, its heritage and the Strangeways workers. People have lost their livelihoods because of how this company has behaved. They will not be best pleased at what we can only see as pouring salt on the wounds.|$|E
5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences {{to reflect on}} the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set {{in the midst of the}} Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E

5|$|The ballads are characterised {{by sexual}} {{encounters}} between everyday people and human(-like) beings {{referred to in}} at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E

25|$|The final {{grouping}} of plays, called Shakespeare's late romances, include Pericles, Prince of Tyre, Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale and The Tempest.

25|$|The great trouvère Chrétien de Troyes {{claims to}} have written a Tristan story, though {{no part of it}} has ever been found.

The scene then turns into clips of Homer enjoying time with his mother from earlier episodes, which ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> Homer as a child hugging his mother over breakfast. The scene then cuts to a black background with white text, saying that the episode was dedicated to Dan Castellaneta's mother, Elsie Castellaneta, and Harry Shearer's mother, Dora K. Warren.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{study showed}} that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the mere exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about {{a large number of}} associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful when a company or product is new and unfamiliar to consumers. An 'optimal' level of exposure to an advertisement may or may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers were primed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> face before being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. The group primed with the happy face bought more beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc's claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they 'like' instead of what they have substantially cognized.|$|E

Proponents of one say that Candido {{is very similar to}} Candide, only <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending; supporters of another claim that Voltaire provided Sciascia with only a starting point from which to work, that the two books are quite distinct.|$|E
500|$|An {{interview}} with Shearsmith and Pemberton was published on British comedy website Chortle.co.uk after Inside No. 9 won the Chortle Award for best TV show. The pair {{were asked if}} they would ever consider writing an episode <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending. Shearsmith responded by saying [...] "Yes, because that would be the biggest surprise of all ... But last year we had the Last Gasp, and that had quite a happy ending - and people hated that one!" [...] Similarly, Pemberton suggested that [...] "people are disappointed if we don't deliver something horrible".|$|E
500|$|The song is {{perceived}} as an upbeat one that leaves listeners <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> feeling.

[...] (That particular lyric is now partially out of date, as WGN radio, which had carried Cubs games {{in some form or}} another since 1925, gave up the radio rights to the Cubs in 2015 to CBS Radio. WGN-TV still carries a portion of the Cubs game telecasts.) The new Manic Sewing Circle cover is a ska-punk version instead of the original folk music.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{performed}} by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. She also co-produced the track with Nathan Chapman. It was released on September 12, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album Fearless (2008). The song was written about a love interest of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597) and {{used it as a}} source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced Romeo and Juliets original tragic conclusion <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy soprano voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of textual}} and {{structural}} similarities with Ulisse, {{it was once}} assumed that Badoaro had written the Le nozze libretto. However, Rosand's researches reveal the librettist to be {{a close friend of}} Badoaro's, Michelangelo Torcigliani. In a lengthy preface Torcigliani introduces his story, taken from Virgil's [...] epic Aeneid, as a tragedia di lieto fine (tragedy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending). [...] He acknowledges [...] numerous departures from the original, including the introduction of a [...] comic character, [...] "Numanus". [...] This was done, he admitted, because [...] "Iro", an analogous character type in Ulisse, had proved popular with theatregoers. The text had been written to meet Monteverdi's requirements for emotional variety, thus enabling him, said Torcigliani, to demonstrate the full range of his musical genius.|$|E
500|$|Klaus Berg of the Hamburg Chronicle {{noted that}} [...] "(...) It is a {{well-known}} cliche that American film makers prefer to provide their audiences <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending. Here, a viewer with even the most superficial and rudimentary knowledge {{of the history of}} the Second World War and of the National Socialist Regime would know from the very outset that a happy ending is out of the question, that all the protagonists' efforts and plans are doomed to end in bitter failure. Knowing this, I was surprised to realize how deeply I was caught up in the tension of the plot, how desperately I was hoping against hope that Cruise and his fellows would after all succeed. (...) No, not for one minute during the entire film did I think about Scientology." ...|$|E
