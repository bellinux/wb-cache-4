500|$|Chatwin {{returned}} {{to the subject of}} art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the Sunday Times Magazine, he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles Chatwin included in <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> Doing Here. The main focus of Utz is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector. Utz's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West. Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects. His distaste for the art world was the result of his days at Sotheby's, and some of his final writing focused on this. The final section of <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> Doing Here, [...] "Tales from the Art World," [...] consists of four short stories on this topic. At the end of <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> Doing Here, Chatwin shares an anecdote about advice he had received from Noël Coward, who told him [...] "Never let anything artistic stand in your way." [...] Chatwin stated, [...] "I've always acted on that advice." ...|$|E

The Sitti Nurbaya storyline has often been reused, to the point that Balfas has referred to similar plots as following [...] "the Sitti Nurbaya formula".|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1979 between Springsteen tour dates, Jackson crisscrossed the U.S. {{promoting}} the Fairlight CMI, a digital sampler made by fellow Australians Peter Vogel and Kim Ryrie. (Ryrie {{grew up in}} Point Piper next to Jackson's house.) The earliest Fairlights were prohibitively expensive, and their 24kHz sampling rate was not considered high enough for audio mastering, but Jackson found that musicians immediately discovered how useful the Fairlight was for composition. Rick Wakeman explored the sampler, as did Tony Bongiovi, founder of the Power Station recording studio in New York City. There, Springsteen was shown the sampler and said, [...] "Ah yeah, BJ that's great, but <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> gonna do with it?" ...|$|E

Meanwhile, Tate has consigned himself to living with Hayden, both {{of whom have been}} blocked out by the Harmons using a trick that Tate taught Violet. As the Harmons are decorating a Christmas tree, Tate promises to wait for Violet forever, as he and Hayden watch on through a door frame. Three years later, Constance (who left town) returns to Los Angeles, but finds that her grandson, Michael (the Antichrist), has murdered his nanny.

500|$|The episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} references to pop culture. Elaine mentions that a man she knows used to nod at her whenever she saw him, but suddenly stopped, leading her to state, [...] " [...] he went from nods to nothing." [...] This prompts George to hum the Tony Bennett song [...] "Rags to Riches", replacing the chorus with [...] "nods to nothing". During a discussion with Elaine, Jerry mentions the 1958 film The Blob. Jerry also mentions the novel Moby Dick, jokingly stating that [...] "when you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends". After George receives a bill from his chiropractor, he states [...] "75 s? <b>What,</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> seeing Sinatra in there?" [...] Singer and actor Frank Sinatra, [...] died {{the same day the}} last episode of Seinfeld was aired on NBC.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Patagonia, Chatwin {{discovered}} a change in leadership at The Sunday Times Magazine and his retainer was not continued. Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a nineteenth-century slave trader born in Brazil who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey (present day Benin). Chatwin had first heard of de Sousa {{during a visit to}} Dahomey in 1972. He returned to the country, by then renamed the People's Republic of Benin, in December 1976 to conduct research. In January 1977, the 1977 Benin coup d'état attempt took place, and Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary, arrested, and detained for three days. Chatwin later wrote about this experience in [...] "A Coup—A Story," [...] which was published in Granta and included in <b>What</b> <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> Doing Here (1989).|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
500|$|According to folk {{tradition}} Marko never died; he {{lives on in}} a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, [...] "Oh God, <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> going to do now?" [...] God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls {{on the ground and}} Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank [...] "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.|$|E

500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> to do with my Gratitude”.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{contract}} or covenant with God is fundamental to the Jewish religion. [...] The idea that God must uphold {{his end of the}} first commandment has been a subject of works such as Elie Wiesel's play The Trial of God (1979), made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at Auschwitz. [...] To art historian Matthew Baigell, Hershe's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of Hillel the Elder's quoted in the Pirkei Avot: [...] "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? [...] But if I am only for myself, <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I?</b> [...] And if not now, when?" [...] Literary scholar Susanne Klingenstein found Hersh's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship. [...] She wrote that [...] "the suffering of the righteous" [...] is [...] "one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought", and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching.|$|E
500|$|In {{the false}} {{breaking}} news story, Lester Holt references the 2007 monster movie Cloverfield. After {{learning about the}} toxic leaks in the building, in which Frank, Toofer, and Lutz need to strip down, Frank says [...] "So much of my life was wasted creating hats!" [...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. When Liz tells Floyd that she saw him on The Today Show, on which she learned he is getting married, Floyd says [...] "Dammit!

Liz reveals that she once participated in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted playing a woman who is strangled on a toilet. Jenna and Tracy, who are having strange dreams about Kenneth, decide they [...] "have to Elm Street this. We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams!" [...] This references the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which the movie's main character—Freddy Krueger—stalks and kills his victims in their dreams.|$|E
