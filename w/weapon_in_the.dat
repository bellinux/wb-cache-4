5|$|At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked {{together}} closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 {{he was appointed}} to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron {{could be used to}} study biochemical processes, and might become a <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fight against cancer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} each 20 minute meal in {{the dining}} hall, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and {{carefully}} counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a potential <b>weapon.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> earlier years as a prison, prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, but this was later relaxed, provided that the prisoners communicated quietly.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} that he {{developed}} the Baby Bombard and sent it off the War Office, Blacker was working for a government department known as MD1, which was given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe. Shortly after the trial of the Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the anti-tank <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of a colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.|$|E

On June 1, 2009, months after X5-452's escape, terrorists detonate an electromagnetic pulse <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere over the U.S. which destroys {{the vast majority of}} computer and communication systems, throwing the country into chaos.|$|E
5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary <b>weapon.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced {{than it had been}} during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.|$|E
5|$|This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, {{would be}} able to provide {{protection}} over a wider area, reducing the number of bases needed to provide full-country defense. Work on this concept continued throughout the 1960s, eventually becoming the primary <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following Sentinel system, and in the modified Sentinel system that was later renamed Safeguard.|$|E

40|$|Weapon {{identification}} {{is a common}} procedure in criminal trials, but has not been investigated scientifically. Much attention has focused on eyewitnesses identifying perpetrators. Exposure to <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media {{and its effects on}} cognition has not been a topic of interest. Few studies have investigated weapon identification, level of confidence <b>in</b> identifying <b>weapons,</b> and amount of exposure to <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media. The present study aims to investigate the relationship, if any, among these variables. The archival data of the study were extracted from a larger database and was subjected to a variety of statistical tests for analysis. Multiple regression analysis demonstrates that exposure to <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media significantly predicts the level of confidence <b>in</b> identifying <b>weapons.</b> MANOVA analysis demonstrates a significant relationship between the ability to accurately identify weapons and the level of confidence <b>in</b> <b>weapon</b> identification. An additional MANOVA shows that the ability to accurately identify weapons is significantly associated with exposure to <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media. Results of the study have ramifications in criminal proceedings...|$|R
5|$|As a youth, Ezeh {{was unable}} to play {{football}} {{because he was too}} big for the local leagues according to Grand Rapids area officials. As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, even though he was not the primary <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> backfield. Ezeh was {{also a member of the}} Cougars rugby team that placed 11th at the 2004 United States High School Rugby National Championships.|$|E
5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one minute, or until the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|E
5|$|Operation Weserübung {{began on}} 9 April 1940 with the invasions of Norway and Denmark, Denmark capitulated within the day whilst Norway {{continued}} to resist with British and French help. The campaign {{was not a}} Blitzkrieg of fast-moving armoured divisions supported by air power as the mountainous terrain ruled out close Panzer/Stuka cooperation. Instead, the Germans relied on paratroops, airborne troops transported by Junkers Ju 52s and specialised ski troops. The Ju 87s were given the role of ground attack and anti-shipping missions. The Ju 87 {{proved to be the}} most effective <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe's armoury carrying out the latter task.|$|E

5|$|The DDoS {{attacks were}} at first {{carried out with}} the Gigaloader and JMeter {{application}}s. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets. The LOIC soon became a signature <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead {{to a number of}} arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses. Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.|$|E
5|$|Units have {{a primary}} job which determines the stat boosts they receive when they level {{up and the}} {{attributes}} associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, but has the stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped <b>weapon.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> previous example, any abilities that require the possession of a great bow, {{will not be allowed}} for use if the character has a Katana equipped.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's {{assistant director of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|Andayya, {{taking a}} non-conformist path {{that was never}} {{repeated}} in Kannada literature, wrote Madana Vijaya ("Triumph of cupid", 1217–1235) using only pure Kannada words (desya) and naturalised Sanskrit words (tadbhava) and totally avoiding assimilated Sanskrit words (tatsamas). This is seen {{by some as a}} rebuttal meant to prove that writing Kannada literature without borrowed Sanskrit words was possible. The poem narrates the story of the moon being imprisoned by the god Shiva in his abode in the Himalayas. In his anger, Kama (Cupid, the god of love, also called Manmata) assailed Shiva with his arrows only to be cursed by Shiva and separated from his beloved. Kama then contrived to rid himself of Shiva's curse. The work also goes by other names such as Sobagina Suggi ("Harvest of Beauty"), Kavane Gella ("Cupid's Conquest") and Kabbigara-kava ("Poets defender"). Kama has an important place in Jain writings even before Andayya. The possibility that this writing was yet another subtle <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intensifying conflict between the dominant Jains and the Veerashaivas, whose popularity was on the rise, is not lost on historians.|$|E
5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E
25|$|Though the Soviet Union had {{proposed}} various nuclear disarmament plans after the U.S. development of atomic <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, the Cold War saw <b>the</b> Soviets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{process of developing}} and deploying nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> full force.

5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E
5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of the proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} {{the wreckage of the}} base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
25|$|In late 1969, President Richard Nixon {{unilaterally}} renounced {{the first}} use of chemical weapons (as well as all methods of biological warfare). He issued a unilateral decree halting production and transport of chemical <b>weapons</b> which remains <b>in</b> effect. From 1967 to 1970 <b>in</b> Operation CHASE, <b>the</b> U.S. disposed of chemical weapons by sinking ships laden with <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep Atlantic.
