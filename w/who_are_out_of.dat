25|$|Virtual Virginia (VVa) is the Department of Education's {{system for}} {{providing}} online courses to students. These classes are mostly Advanced Placement classes {{for students who}} are home schooled or go to a public high school (some courses are offered to middle school students) where the course is not taught. These courses are offered free of charge to students enrolled through a high school, but not to those in private or home schooling, or those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> state. This program got its start in the 1980s, when AP courses were offered through satellite schools to students in Virginia, mostly to those in rural areas without many other education options. The program became known as the Virginia Satellite Education Network (VSEN). That program got combined with Virtual Virginia Advanced Placement School to become what it is today.|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 2008, Gravel {{announced}} that he would leave the Democrats and join the Libertarian Party, saying: [...] "My libertarian views, as well as my strong stance against war, the military industrial complex and American imperialism, seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> touch with the average American; elites that reject the empowerment of American citizens I offered to the Democratic Party {{at the beginning of this}} presidential campaign with the National Initiative for Democracy." [...] The following day Gravel entered the race for the 2008 Libertarian presidential nomination, saying that he would have run as a third-party candidate all along except that he needed the public exposure that came from being in the earlier Democratic debates. Gravel's initial notion of running as a fusion candidate with other parties was met with skepticism and not pursued.|$|E

500|$|Aerith has {{received}} an overall positive reception from critics. GamesTM {{referred to her}} as a [...] "gaming legend." [...] RPGamer's Stuart Hoggan opined that although Aerith [...] "represented the token damsel in distress," [...] she [...] "broke the mould in terms of personality," [...] possessing [...] "an admirable pluck that was not brassy nor off-putting."

2500|$|The {{components}} of a band uniform are numerous. [...] Common design elements include hats (typically shakos, pith helmets, combination hats or other styles of helmets) with feather plumes, capes, gloves, rank cords, and other embellishments. [...] The USC Spirit of Troy Marching Band and Troy University's Sound of the South Marching Band wear traditional Trojan helmets. [...] It is also common for band uniforms to have a stripe down the leg and light-colored shoes, or spats over dark shoes to emphasize {{the movement of the}} legs while marching. [...] Similarly, uniforms may feature additional components which highlight movement of the upper body, such as the [...] "wings" [...] worn by the University of Minnesota's marching band to highlight flanking movements on the field. Competitive bands however, many times opt for matching uniforms, especially pants and shoes (usually white or black) to hide the visual effect of members <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> step as seen from a distance. Occasionally, a band forgos traditional uniforms in favor of costumes that fit the theme of its field show. The costumes {{may or may not be}} uniform throughout the band. This kind of specialized uniform change is usually confined to competitive marching bands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{civil war}} in Yemen {{severely}} impacted and degraded the country's education system. The number of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school increased to 1.8 million in 2015–2016 {{out of more than}} 5 million registered students according to the 2013 statistics released by the Ministry of Education. Moreover, 3600 schools are directly affected; 68 schools are occupied by armed groups, 248 schools have severe structural damage, and 270 are used to house refugees.> The Yemen government {{has not been able to}} improve this situation due to limited authority and manpower. Some of the education system's problems include: [...] not enough financial resources to operate schools and salaries of the teachers, not enough materials to reconstruct damaged schools, and lack of machinery to print textbooks and provide school supplies. These are caused by the unstable government that cannot offer enough financial support since many schools are either damaged or used for other purposes. Due to warfare and destruction of schools, the education ministry, fortunately, was able to send teams to oversee primary and secondary schools' final exam in order to give students 15-16 school year certificates. Currently, the UNICEF is raising money to support students and fix schools damaged by armed conflicts.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Lancashire were {{relegated to}} the second {{division}} of the County Championship {{for the first time}} since the competition was restructured into two divisions. This was despite starting the season as the bookmarkers' favourite to win the competition. At one point in the season, the team was without eightbowlers, with James Anderson, Andrew Flintoff, and Sajid Mahmood on international duty, while Glen Chapple, Dominic Cork, Kyle Hogg, Peter Martin, and all-rounder Carl Hooper were all injured. Their problems were not blamed solely on the injuries, Watkinson said [...] "quite simply the opposition have done the basics better than us. In addition we've one or two <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> form on top of the injury list which ripped us to pieces". Despite being relegated in the County Championship, the team managed finish as runners up in the National League and were expected to be promoted back to the first division of first-class cricket in the 2005 season. While Watkinson expected backlash from the fans, he said that [...] "they were tremendously understanding about the injury situation". The squad underwent changes, with six players leaving– including Martin and Chris Schofield– and six joining, as well as a change of captain from wicket-keeper Warren Hegg to batsman Mark Chilton; Chilton was the club's first Yorkshire-born captain. Between 1864 and 2004, Lancashire played 2,790matches, winning 1,034, losing 583, drawing 1,170, with three tied matches. In this period, no other team had drawn more matches. The team's percentage of wins was 37.06%, third behind Yorkshire (44.05%) and Surrey (39.74%).|$|E
