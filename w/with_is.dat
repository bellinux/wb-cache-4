5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating <b>with</b> <b>is</b> a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E
5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid.

40|$|Boundary {{extension}} (BE) is {{a phenomenon}} in which the boundary of a picture is reportedly extended in memory. The model known to best fit <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> is the Extension-Normalization model (intraub, 1996), which explains BE by the dual memory process. While focusing on this model, this paper reviews relevant literature dealing <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> It highlights the necessity of defining the phenomenon itself more precisely and of constructing appropriate methods, with which to measure BE. Additionally, the paper considers the possibility that, BE has multiple origins and discusses perceptual and clinical factors associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> that were not addressed in previous research...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{developing}} esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) for patients <b>with</b> Barrett's esophagus (<b>BE)</b> is approximately 0. 5 % per year. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> estimate and perceive their risk {{of developing}} EAC. DESIGN: Questionnaire study. SETTING: Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> who were undergoing surveillance endoscopy based on histologic and flow cytometric results. PATIENTS: A total of 192 patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individual patients were asked to estimate the numerical risk to develop EAC for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> in general and for themselves. How patients perceived their own risk was measured {{on a scale from}} "very small" to "very large. " RESULTS: At least 1 question was filled out by 169 patients (88 % response). Sixty percent of respondents underestimated the numerical risk for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE,</b> in general, to develop EAC, while even more patients (69 %) underestimated their own risk. Most respondents perceived their own risk as very small or small (63 %). LIMITATIONS: Risk estimations may depend on the response scale used. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> underestimated the numerical risk and perceived their {{risk of developing}} EAC as (very) low.

40|$|BACKGROUND: GQ 1 b {{antibody}} (GQ 1 b-Ab) {{is detected}} in approximately two-thirds of sera of patients <b>with</b> Bickerstaffs encephalitis (<b>BE).</b> Whilst {{some of the}} remaining patients have antibodies to other gangliosides, many patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> are reported to be seronegative. METHODS AND RESULTS: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibody (VGKC-Ab) at high titer was detected during the diagnostic work-up of one patient <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> Sera of an additional patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and nine patients with Miller Fisher syndrome (MF) (all GQ 1 b-Ab positive) were investigated for VGKC-Ab and other anti-neuronal antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation using 125 I-dendrotoxin-VGKC and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Two patients with MF exhibited moderate titer VGKC-Abs. Regardless of positivity for VGKC or GQ 1 b antibodies, serum IgG of all patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF reacted with the molecular layer and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in a distinctive pattern. CONCLUSION: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies might be involved in some cases of BE or MF. The common staining pattern despite different antibody results suggests {{that there might be}} other, as yet unidentified, antibodies associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF...|$|R

5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals <b>with</b> <b>is</b> an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E

Patients <b>with</b> COPD <b>were</b> mostly male, older, had a poorer respiratory function and more frequent exacerbations. There were no differences in the proportion of patients with chronic bronchial colonisation or in the isolated microorganisms. A significantly larger proportion of patients with COPD received treatment with bronchodilators, inhaled steroids and intravenous antibiotics, but there was no difference in the use of long term oral or inhaled antibiotherapy. During a follow-up period of 3. 36 years, the overall proportion of deaths was 13. 8 %. When compared to the remaining aetiologies, patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> associated <b>with</b> COPD presented the highest mortality rate. The multivariate analysis showed that the diagnosis of COPD in a patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> as a primary diagnosis increased the risk of death by 1. 77. Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> related to COPD have the same microbiological characteristics as patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> due to other aetiologies.

5|$|Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam {{left for}} Cairo {{to study at}} the al-Azhar Mosque.

However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well-acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused. At al-Azhar, al-Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad (holy struggle). He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ′alim and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur'an. In addition he preached as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.|$|E

During the ceremony, Victor has Victoria arrested {{in an attempt}} to stop the wedding. J.T. gains full custody of Reed and moves to Washington, DC with his new wife Mackenzie for her job. Victoria and her siblings pursue a lawsuit against Victor to gain control of a cosmetics line. After Victoria miscarries a child with Billy, he illegally pays $2,000,000 for a child, whom they name Lucy in January 2011. Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) gains custody of Lucy and Billy leaves town without disclosing his whereabouts to his wife. Victoria later pursues divorce proceedings in Billy's long absence. After their divorce, Victoria and Billy's mother, Jill Fenmore, try unsuccessfully to locate Billy whose daughter has Leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. The pair find each other in a New York airport bar, reunite, and remarry in December 2011. As they return home from their honeymoon, Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan) arrives, announcing she is pregnant with Billy’s child. Chelsea barters with Billy demanding 3 million dollars. She later gives birth to a boy, Johnny, but gives Billy full custody of their son. Victoria decides to stay in her marriage to Billy and help him raise the child. Later, Victoria returns to Newman Enterprises to try and save it from Sharon’s destruction. While on business in Miami in November 2012, she is kidnapped by Eddie G.
