5000|$|Since the 2006 {{bombing of}} the al-Askari shrine, it had been under {{protection}} of local guards who were predominantly Sunni. Both American military and Iraqi security officials were worried that the guards had been infiltrated by Al Qaeda forces in Iraq. To counter this the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad were bringing in a new guard unit - predominantly Shiite. This {{changing of the guard}} is believed to have had some role in the timing of the attack. Abdul Sattar Abdul Jabbar, a prominent Sunni cleric, told Al Jazeera television that local Sunnis may have been provoked as he claimed [...] "the new guards had arrived at the shrine shouting sectarian slogans". Gunfire was reported around the shrine before the attack, [...] "which may have been related to the change of guards." [...] Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Policemen at the shrine (15 of them according to US military sources) had been detained for questioning along with [...] "an unspecified number of other suspects." [...] It was confirmed that [...] "the entire Iraqi security force responsible for guarding the mosque, the 3rd Battalion of the Salahuddin province police, was detained for investigation." [...] The Interior Ministry would only tell reporters that agents of [...] "a terrorist group" [...] had been arrested and were under interrogation. On Sunday 17 June 2007 Iraqi forces captured four additional suspects and their raid [...] "also turned up a compact disc showing attacks on U.S.-led troops, blasting caps and detonation <b>wire,</b> <b>identification</b> cards for access to al-Askari mosque and photographs depicting terrorist training exercises." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{discrete}} Coefficient of Determination (CoD) {{has become}} {{a key component of}} inference methods for stochastic Boolean models. We develop a parametric maximum-likelihood (ML) method for the inference of the discrete CoD for static Boolean systems and for dynamical Boolean systems in the steady state. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we compare the performance of the parametric ML approach against that of common nonparametric alternatives for CoD estimation, which show that the parametric approach has the least bias, variance, and root mean-square (RMS) error, provided that the system noise level is not too high. Next we consider the application of the proposed estimation approach to the problem of system identification, where only partial knowledge about the system is available. Inference procedures are proposed for both the static and dynamical cases, and their performance in logic gate and <b>wiring</b> <b>identification</b> is assessed through numerical experiments. The results indicate that identification rates converge to 100 % as sample size increases, and that the convergence rate is much faster as more prior knowledge is available. For <b>wiring</b> <b>identification,</b> the parametric ML approach is compared to the nonparametric approaches, and it produced superior identification rates, though as the amount of prior knowledge is reduced, its performance approaches that of the nonparametric ML estimator, which was generally the best nonparametric approach in our experiments.

40|$|The CSR {{electron}} cooler will {{be employed}} both for phase space cooling {{and as a}} target for electron-ion collision experiments. Aligning the beams is essential for both applications and, therefore, the cooler features two rotating wire scanners for beam position determination. In {{the course of this}} work their design has been finalised. A scheme has been developed to calculate the transverse beam location from two measured rotation angles. This can be utilised to determine the centres of the electron and ion beams. While in the former case a signal is directly induced at the <b>wires,</b> <b>identification</b> of the latter depends on an increasing restriction of phase space with advancing rotation. A procedure is proposed to detect the decline in ion intensity with the CSR’s current pick-up. Furthermore, the electron collector of the cooler has been designed and assembled. A Wien filter is included to minimise backstreaming of secondary electrons, which will prolong the lifetime of the GaAs photocathode. Calculations and a simulation were conducted to optimise its design. Additionally, an analyser cup allows for beam profile and energy distribution measurements. From this, among others, the electron density can be computed, which is necessary for rate coefficient calculations...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{issues is}} now taking a growing {{place in society}} {{and to ensure that}} {{companies}} meet public expectations and do their part in working towards a sustainable development, environmental management system is said to be an effective tool (Almgren & Brorson, 2009). This case study has examined a company's environmental management system in order to find strengths and weaknesses within the ISO 14001 system. The work was carried out using interviews, document reviews and analyzes in which the three main concepts control the report; "daily work", "audit" and "environmental aspects". The results shows that the daily work looks different depending on where you are; in the production or at the office. The audit examined all documents related to the environmental management system and the study showed that the biggest strengths was the commitment and waste handling while areas such as environmental goals and management review needed improvement.

40|$|Applied System Identification for a Four Wheel Reaction Wheel Platform By Seth Franklyn Silva At the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo {{there is}} a four-wheel {{reaction}} wheel pyramidal simulator platform supported by an air-bearing. This simulator has the current capability to measure the wheel speeds and angular velocity of the platform, and with these measurements, the system identification process was used to obtain the mass properties of this simulator. A handling algorithm was developed to allow wireless data acquisition and command to the spacecraft simulator from a “ground” computer allowing the simulator {{to be free of}} induced torques due to <b>wiring.</b> The system <b>identification</b> algorithm using a least squares estimation scheme was tested on this simulator and compared to theoretical analysis. The resultant principle inertia about the z-axis from the experimental analysis was 3. 5 percent off the theoretical, while the other inertias had an error of up to 187 percent. The error is explained as noise attributed to noise in the measurement, averaging inconsistencies, low bandwidth, and derivation of accelerations from measured data...|$|R
40|$|References to {{literature}} are never {{far away in}} discourse about the critically acclaimed HBO series The Wire (2002 - 2008). It has been compared to, amongst others, nineteenth-century Russian realism, French naturalism, and Shakespearean drama. “Dickensian” is another literary reference that frequently attached itself to The Wire in early reviews, prompting the show’s creators to mockingly incorporate it into the fifth and final season. Character James Whiting, the executive editor for the Baltimore Sun, wants his contributors to bring the “Dickensian aspect” into their reporting. His understanding of “Dickensian,” however, seems to be synonymous {{with the kind of}} Tiny Tim and Paul Dombey heart-break stories that Baltimore Sun journalist Scott Templeton promptly conjures up and passes off for fact. We argue that capitalist disempowerment of individuals is where “the Dickensian aspect” of the show lies. Several of Dickens’s novels—for example Martin Chuzzlewit (1844), Bleak House (1852) and Little Dorrit (1857) —thematise the devastation wrought by the faceless and indifferent institutions of Victorian England on innocent and helpless individuals. We will show that the circumstances of production for his novels within a shifting socio-economic landscape informed Dickens’s representations of the dangers inherent to replacing personal agency in business by an anonymous stream of money. The true “Dickensian aspect” of The <b>Wire</b> is the <b>identification</b> of impersonal and ungovernable economies that originate from opaque and unchecked currents of money as the cause of social disease...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral hip {{prostheses}} {{challenge the}} acquisition of clinically useful treatment planning images for prostate HDR brachytherapy. Prostheses can introduce severe artifact into the principal modalities used for HDR prostate brachytherapy imaging – ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MR) and computed tomography (CT). This study aimed to develop a protocol for clinically useful image acquisition that would ensure accurate and reliable implanted needle identification in all patients, including those with bilateral hip prostheses. It was found that in conventional B-mode grey-scale ultrasound images used routinely for image guidance in brachytherapy procedures, artefact such as shadowing and reverberation were confounding factors for accurate HDR brachytherapy treatment planning and delivery. For MR imaging, spatial distortion due to local magnetic field disruption, local signal void within prostheses, and localised areas of high signal intensity near the prostheses all complicated image interpretation for treatment planning. On the other hand, CT images were generally free from distortion and were spatially accurate. The impact of volume averaging on the accuracy of needle tip identification was studied with models of steel implant needles, and CT level and window settings to ensure tip definition to within ± 0. 7 mm (ensuring dosimetric accuracy of better than 0. 7 %), were determined. In a study of 91 patients with stainless steel needle implants and without hip prostheses, the mean caudal displacement before adjustment was 5. 4 mm (SD 3. 3 mm). Plastic needle implants in 14 patients with bilateral hip prostheses was examined, and the mean caudal displacement before adjustment was 1. 6 mm (SD 3. 1 mm). Nitinol marker wires developed for use in plastic needles implanted into prosthesis patients {{were found to be}} superior when compared with standard rigid obturators. The wires, with the same flex properties as an active Ir- 192 source <b>wire,</b> assist accurate <b>identification</b> of needle tips and may also provide an improved match to the treatment geometry for treatment planning purposes. The impact of stainless steel and plastic needle movement on treatment efficacy was studied via Tumour Control Probability (TCP) calculations using three different TCP models and simulated brachytherapy treatment plans. This study showed that it was feasible to maintain displacements less than 3 mm, and that if this limit were adopted, it would result in most patients having TCP close to or greater than 95 % of the original.
