5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again. He went off at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> run on {{intermediate}} tyres in wet conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of}} the session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Wizards {{began an}} {{association}} with The Beanstalk Group, a brand licensing agency and consultancy, to license the Magic brand. After {{the success of}} Magic, Wizards published RoboRally in 1994, and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. Wizards also expanded its role-playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf, Inc. in 1994. In 1995, Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield, The Great Dalmuti, which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa. In August 1995, Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line. Peter Adkison explained that the company <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> disservice to the games with {{lack of support and}} had lost money on all of Wizards' roleplaying game products. Also in 1995, Wizards' annual sales passed US$65million.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In, {{located on}} Commissary Lane across from Star Tours and {{adjacent}} to ABC Commissary, opened on April 20, 1991 {{as one of}} the twenty new attractions opened at Walt Disney World to mark the complex's twentieth anniversary. The restaurant was created with a strong emphasis on theme, in emulation of the 50's Prime Time Café, which had opened two years prior. Disney hoped that the focus on theme would bring the Sci-Fi Dine-In the level of success that had been garnered by the 50's Prime Time Café. Within five weeks of opening, it was serving between 1,500 and 2,000 meals on a daily basis, just as the 50's Prime Time Café <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>A</b> year after opening, the Sci-Fi Dine-In had become the most popular restaurant in the park, serving more than 2,200 people per day at peak periods. Starting from its earliest days, the restaurant equipped its servers with point of sale mobile devices that relayed orders to a printer in the kitchen, which was considered at the time to be in keeping with the science fiction theme because the technology had been developed shortly prior.|$|E

25|$|During the program, another psychic <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> sorting of 250 Zener cards, {{guessing}} {{which of}} the five symbols was on each one.

However, {{she was able to}} get only fifty predictions correct, which is no better than random guessing.|$|E

25|$|Despite Leonard's {{reasonable}} {{nature and}} friendly personality, he occasionally demonstrates a mean streak. These include deliberately triggering Sheldon's obsessive compulsive problems, mocking Howard and Raj whenever they slip up, and making sniping comments when Penny's commitment issues flare up. In addition, {{he is often}} shown to be quite jealous, often feeling insecure and defensive whenever Penny interacts with another guy, and on one occasion trying to frighten off a British college student she <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> project with, because Penny commented positively on his accent.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the AFL <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> {{better job}} of {{expanding}} into the fast-growing white collar sector, with its organizations of clerks, public employees, teachers, and service workers. Although the AFL building trades maintained all-white policies, the AFL had more black members in all as the CIO. The problem of union corruption was growing in public awareness, and CIO's industrial unions were less vulnerable to penetration by criminal elements than were the AFL's trucking, longshoring, building, and entertainment unions. But Meany had a strong record in fighting corruption in New York unions, and was {{highly critical of the}} notoriously corrupt Teamsters.|$|E

[...] Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted General Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> bad job, though, and when the news started to break that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.|$|E

Jen Creer of TV Squad criticized the writing, but said she felt that Sophia Myles <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> [...] "decent job of developing her character and embracing the material". Carl Cortez of iFMagazine.com said this episode improved [...] "leaps and bounds", and was a [...] "step in the right direction". He gave the episode a 'C' rating, saying the direction was [...] "lifeless" [...] and the acting was [...] "stilted". AOL TV placed the show in its list of TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures.|$|E

Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his [...] "unusual" [...] style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to [...] "discuss [...] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and [...] "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, [...] "Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?" ...|$|E
