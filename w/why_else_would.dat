Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, writing that [...] "this episode vividly demonstrates that what Carl Sagan once called 'the burden of skepticism' is no longer being shouldered by anyone in the series. <b>Why</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> Mulder's assertion that a necromancer has successfully raised the dead provoke such a languid response {{in a room full}} of FBI agents?" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, noting that the episode's premise felt, [...] "stylistically wrong for Millennium." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson argued the episode was [...] "a terrible X-File" [...] because, instead of featuring Mulder and Scully solving a mystery, the plot revolved around the two saving the world from Armageddon, which caused [...] "the thin credibility upon which hangs the series [...]" [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.

Several months before, he and Fugate had a falling-out, when Henry Fugate and his father were going to testify in a perjury case against Dean in July. Dean was arrested, but before he could be taken to Estillville jail, he escaped and attempted to make a run into the mountains.
