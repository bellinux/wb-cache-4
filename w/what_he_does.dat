5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of Clannad. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the {{beginning}} of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> for them.|$|E
5|$|Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators {{and plays}} her message machine, which {{contains}} the victim's {{phone call from}} the previous night. She attempts to get into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a message on the machine. She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E
5|$|Syme {{argued that}} {{it was a mistake to}} regard it as a {{historical}} work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the History is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. (The History implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the Quadriga tyrannorum — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the History itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} two years were somewhat precarious {{for the young}} Donizetti: the 16-year-old created quite a reputation for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> do—which is regularly to fail to attend classes—and also for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> instead, which as {{to make something of}} a spectacle of himself in the town.|$|R
25|$|Adoration is {{the first}} {{attitude}} of man acknowledging {{that he is a}} creature before his Creator. Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately that God is God. It lauds God for his own sake and gives him glory, quite beyond <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> but simply because He is.|$|E
25|$|John Pike, {{an analyst}} at the think tank GlobalSecurity, says he {{believes}} the weapon is roughly as powerful as the Russians claim. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not necessarily believe is that the weapon is new.

25|$|Arden confronts Anne to {{question}} her motives. She {{insists that he}} is Hans Grüper and he prepares to show her <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> at the asylum. She shoots him in the leg with a gun that she took from a detective she bumped into on the stairs and then hears a groan from a closet. She opens it to find a disfigured Shelley (Chloë Sevigny), who begs Anne to kill her.|$|E
60|$|There was an {{engaging}} shyness in Bella, coupled with {{an engaging}} tenderness of love and confidence and pride, in thus first calling him by name, which made it quite excusable in John Rokesmith to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was, once more {{to give her the}} appearance of vanishing as aforesaid.|$|R

25|$|However, {{even these}} {{seemingly}} conciliatory gestures did not quell unease by his critics at his election. Some {{have pointed out}} that he qualified his statements on the constitution with the statement that this is a personal suggestion. Furthermore, it is widely believed in Taiwan that some of these gestures were essentially forced on him again by pressure from the United States and the PRC. The PRC has stated many times that it cares little about what Chen says, but will watch closely {{in the next few months}} to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> a standard sentence that Communist China continues to quote.|$|E
25|$|Thor {{agrees to}} compete in a {{drinking}} contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. Útgarða-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. Útgarða-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, Útgarða-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.|$|E
25|$|As can be seen, the Skjöldunga saga retells {{the story}} of Eadgils {{fighting}} his uncle Onela, but in this version Onela is no longer Eadgils' uncle, but a Norwegian king of Oppland. This change is {{generally considered to be}} a late confusion between the core province of the Swedes, Uppland, and its Norwegian namesake Oppland. Whereas, Beowulf leaves the Danish court with the suspicion that Hroðulf (Rolfo Krage, Hrólfr Kraki) might claim the Danish throne for himself at the death of Hroðgar (Roas, Hróarr), it is exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> in Scandinavian tradition. A notable difference is that, in Beowulf, Eadgils receives the help of the Geatish king Beowulf against Onela, whereas it is the Danish king Hroðulf who provides help in Scandinavian tradition.|$|E

25|$|The {{final chapter}} of the game, titled The Old Warehouse, serves as the climax. Each of the three main {{characters}} (Ethan, Madison, and Norman) {{have the opportunity to}} find the warehouse where Shaun is, rescue him, and stop the Origami Killer, depending on their actions and choices throughout the game. In all, there are eight possible endings. If Ethan goes alone, he can either save Shaun or watch him die, and either spare or kill Shelby. Regardless of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> he will be shot dead by the police when he tries to escape. If all three make it, Ethan and Madison will have to save Shaun while Norman deals with Shelby. If Ethan fails to arrive or Norman dies, Madison can help the other one rescue Shaun and fight Shelby, and if neither arrive, Madison will perform the rescue and the fight herself. Once the chapter is complete, a series of clips and news reports will play, and then the player will learn what happened to each character. Each ending is determined by what occurred in the final chapter. The best ending shows Ethan and his son starting a family with Madison, Lauren spitting on Scott's grave after cursing his memory, and Norman retiring from the FBI to focus on treating his addiction. The worst shows Madison and Norman dead, with Ethan being successfully framed as the Origami Killer by Blake and Scott escaping in the chaos. Giving in to his pain, Ethan commits suicide in his cell.|$|E

50|$|His Old Man's Diary (1871-72) is an {{interesting}} record, though even here the taint of fabrication is not absent. Unfortunately, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> amiss is more striking to the imagination than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> aright, and <b>he</b> will be chiefly remembered by it. He died at Maidenhead, where he had long resided, on 17 September 1883.|$|R

500|$|Boyd {{believes}} {{that he needs to}} work on his turn of pace and also improve his heading ability, and considers these as his main weaknesses. Former manager Darren Ferguson said [...] "there might be those who say he lacks a little bit of pace but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not have in his legs he has in his head". In his career, Boyd has only ever scored three headed goals, and says that he is much more comfortable with the ball at his feet.|$|E
500|$|Jainism's strong {{emphasis}} on the doctrine of karma and intense asceticism was also criticised by the Buddhists. Thus, the Saṃyutta Nikāya narrates the story of Asibandhakaputta, a headman who was originally a disciple of Māhavīra. He debates with the Buddha, telling him that, according to Māhavīra (Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta), a man's fate or karma is decided by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> habitually. The Buddha responds, considering this view to be inadequate, stating that even a habitual sinner spends more time [...] "not doing the sin" [...] and only some time actually [...] "doing the sin." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Gilmour and Mason {{decided to}} revisit {{recordings}} made with Wright, mainly during the Division Bell sessions, {{to create a}} new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and [...] "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: [...] "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> and how his playing {{was at the heart of}} the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was." ...|$|E

500|$|Owing to {{the strange}} {{nature of the}} language, the Century 21 writers would brief Unwin on episode plots and then leave space in their scripts for the actor to draft all the Unwinese {{dialogue}} himself.

500|$|Christian Bale as Alfred Borden (The Professor)/Fallon, {{a working}} class magician. Christian Bale {{expressed}} interest in playing the part and was cast after Jackman. Although Nolan had previously cast Bale as Batman in Batman Begins, he did not consider Bale for the part of Borden until Bale contacted him about the script. Nolan said that Bale was [...] "exactly right" [...] for the part of Borden {{and that it was}} [...] "unthinkable" [...] for anyone else to play the part. Nolan described Bale as an actor [...] "terrific to work with" [...] who [...] "takes <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> very, very seriously". Nolan suggested that the actors should not read the book, but Bale ignored his advice.|$|E

Michael Johnson, the 200 m world-record holder, took note of Bolt's potential but worried that the young sprinter might be over-pressured, stating, [...] "It's all about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> three, four, five years down the line". Bolt had also impressed the athletics hierarchy, and he received the IAAF Rising Star Award for 2002.|$|E
