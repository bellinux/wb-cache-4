25|$|John Dean {{believed}} that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman {{could go to}} the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president’s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> was due to the way Nixon was speaking, {{as if he were trying}} to prod attendees’ recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{invented the}} {{lightning}} rod {{based on what}} he learned from experiments with his electrostatic machine. [...] Franklin and his associates observed that pointed objects were more effective than blunt objects at [...] "drawing off" [...] and [...] "throwing off" [...] sparks from static electricity. This discovery was first reported by Hopkinson. Franklin <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> discovery could be used in a practical invention. [...] He thought something could be made to attract the electricity out of storm clouds, but first he had to verify that lightning bolts really are giant electric sparks. He wrote Collinson and Cadwallader Colden letters about this theory. The 1752 Franklin letter to Collinson of October 19 of the kite experiment is noted by historian LeMay as a basis how it proved that lightning was electricity. Tom Tucker of the Isothermal Community College doubts the account however because of ambiguities in the account and points that out in his book Bolt of Fate: Benjamin Franklin and his Electric Kite Hoax. Others disagree with this view, arguing that Franklin would not make up such a fake story because he valued the integrity of the scientific community.|$|E

500|$|... "Hush" [...] {{was highly}} praised when it aired, {{not only for}} its riskiness in {{presenting}} viewers with extended silence, but for the frightening qualities of The Gentlemen. Robert Bianco from USA Today comments, [...] "(i)n a medium in which producers tend to grow bored with their own creations, either trashing them or taking them in increasingly bizarre directions, Whedon continues {{to find new ways to}} make his fabulously entertaining series richer and more compelling. With or without words, he's a TV treasure." [...] In the Ottawa Citizen, Chuck Barney writes, [...] "I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> enormously entertaining cult favourite would lose some starch once our favourite little slayer moved on to college. But happily, it continues to win us over with the way it deftly bounces between the genres of comedy, horror and romance. The recent silent episode (Hush) was brilliant." [...] Alan Sepinwall in The Star-Ledger calls it a [...] "magnificently daring episode", explaining [...] "(w)hat makes it particularly brave is that, even when Buffy has been failing to click dramatically this year, the show has still been able to get by on the witty dialogue, which is all but absent after the first few scenes. Whedon finds ways to get around that, with several cast members—particularly Anthony Head as the scholarly Giles and Alyson Hannigan as nervous witch Willow—proving to be wonderfully expressive silent comedians." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, maybe, if we can get away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E

On October 2, 1967, Aunor signed an eight-picture non-exclusive contract with Sampaguita Pictures, with the assurance that she would be given a singing part. [...] Aunor made several youth-oriented films like All Over World and Way Out of the Country.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the next}} two years after the Københavns {{disappearance}} {{there were a number of}} sightings of a mysterious five-masted ship fitting its description in the Pacific, fueling further speculation about the vessel. Early reports came from Chilean fishermen, then in July 1930, the crew of an Argentine freighter sighted a five-masted [...] "phantom ship" [...] during a gale. The captain took their statements and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> was the [...] "wraith of the Copenhagen". Further sightings came in the following weeks from Easter Island and the Peruvian coast. Later some wreckage, including a piece of stern bearing the name [...] "København", reportedly was found off West Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier that year, in February 2011, the Detroit archdiocesan {{director}} of communications, Ned McGrath, {{told reporters that}} [...] "the Real Catholic TV enterprise had yet to present itself or receive approval of its apostolate and programming from the archdiocese." [...] When asked during the Madrid controversy in July what the relationship between his group and his local archbishop was, Voris {{said he did not}} know. He stated that he {{had never been able to}} reach the archbishop after personally making six attempts to schedule a meeting. Voris <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> was interference from the bureaucracy surrounding the archbishop and said he was willing to discuss the issue with organizers, but questioned if there was not [...] "something else at work".|$|E
2500|$|The passage goes on {{to state}} {{incorrectly}} that the MacDonnells had by 1649 been in possession of the Glens of Antrim for 227 years, but above we are provided with our only surviving mention of what was a tradition current in Ireland {{some period of time}} before the mid-17th century. Duald Mac Firbis reported pedigrees and traditions as he found them and so it is not his own speculation. Without offering an opinion on this claim of Greek origins, John O'Donovan <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> should really mean (to Scotland with) William the Lion, it being the well known case that the Scottish king brought a number of Norman families with him to Scotland, from 1174, following his captivity in England. In fact the first known Byset in Scotland, Henricus Byset, witnessed a charter by William circa 1198. But this is not of the most importance, as the family are typically classed as Norman in any case, even if their origins beyond that grouping are uncertain. Edmund Chisholm-Batten took the Irish tradition seriously and offered some possibilities, first noting the similarity of the arms of the Byzantine Greek family named Dassiotes to those of the Bissetts. Alternatively, noting an instance of the name being spelled Buset in 1294, he suggests the family name Βυσσητòς, from the word for [...] "fine linen", Βυσσoς.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the week}} of episodes from 16 to 20 July, Kat's lover rents a flat for them to share. Inside Soap <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> was the biggest clue so far, saying it {{suggests}} he has access to money, because flats in London are not cheap. They said it might seem familiar, as Max has rented flats before for his lovers Stacey (when cheating on Tanya), and Tanya (when cheating on Vanessa Gold (Zöe Lucker)). They said Derek also [...] "wouldn't think twice about flashing his cash" [...] and opined that Jack would probably {{be able to afford}} it as well. They said viewers do not know enough about Ray yet but he would probably {{not be able to afford}} it with his job as a pub chef, and Michael, although forced to steal from Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) to pay for his wedding, is married to Janine, who is a millionaire. Kate White from Inside Soap later opined that Michael would be able to get the money for the flat as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement. In relation to the flat, Soaplife focussed on Ray following the dance between him and Kat, and thought that if it was him, then he is [...] "either a secret millionnaire or EastEnders hasn't thought this one through." [...] Soaplife also used this to rule Jack out, as he has his own flat and would not need to rent one.|$|E
2500|$|The next week, Kim {{notices that}} Ray has {{a string of}} missed calls on his mobile phone, and {{suspects}} he is having an affair. All About Soap said that Ray is showing all the signs of having an affair, but has no scenes with Kat, which they said would be [...] "crucial" [...] if he {{was having an affair}} with her. They went on to say that if Ray reveals what he is up to, he could be the first suspect to be eliminated. Soaplife said that Kat never has her mobile out of her hand, so when Kim catches Ray texting a mystery woman, it could mean that he is texting Kat. Inside Soap also <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> was evidence of Ray being Kat's secret lover. Carena Crawford from All About Soap said that when Ray is seen with flowers heading for the tube and on the phone saying he is meeting the person he is speaking to, at the same time Kat is on her phone arranging to meet her lover, she thought it was [...] "the biggest clue yet" [...] that it could be Ray, especially when they later return to the pub at the same time. Inside Soap noticed in that week that episodes were [...] "desperately trying to rule out Jack" [...] when he has sex with three other women. They felt it could be a red herring, saying [...] "We reckon all this seduction is supposed to make us turn a blind eye to Jack's antics—but [...] we're keeping them peeled where [...] is concerned!" [...] They also wondered how he could find the time to meet these women if he was seeing Kat as well.|$|E
