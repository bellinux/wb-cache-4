Some are concerned with revenge. Some with self-aggrandizement. Some just have nothing better to do. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> age of fake IDs, fake money, fake e-mails, fake URLs, fake IP addresses, and fake votes..."

500|$|Later {{historian}}s, however, took Gibbon's emphases even further. As Marxist historian G.E.M. de Ste. Croix {{put it in}} 1954, [...] "The so-called Great Persecution {{has been}} exaggerated in the Christian tradition to an extent which even Gibbon did not fully appreciate." [...] In 1972, the ecclesiastical Protestant historian Hermann Dörries was embarrassed to admit to his colleagues that his sympathies lay with the Christians rather than their persecutors. W.H.C. Frend guesses that 3,0003,500 Christians {{were killed in the}} persecution. Although the number of verifiably true martyrs' tales has fallen, and estimates of the total casualty rate have been reduced, some modern writers are less skeptical than Gibbon of the severity of the persecution. As the author Stephen Williams [...] wrote in 1985, [...] "even allowing a margin for invention, what remains is terrible enough. Unlike Gibbon, <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> age which has experienced similar things, and knows how unsound is that civilised smile of incredulity at such reports. Things can be, have been, every bit as bad as our worst imaginings." ...|$|E

Well, I mean {{to try and find}} a lift by which I may be raised unto God, for I am too tiny to climb the steep stairway of perfection. [...] Thine Arms, then, O Jesus, are the lift which must raise me up even unto Heaven. To get there I need not grow; on the contrary, I must remain little, I must become still less.|$|E

2500|$|The Seder {{concludes with}} a prayer that the night's service be accepted. A hope for the Messiah is expressed: [...] "L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim! - Next year in Jerusalem!" [...] Jews in Israel, and {{especially}} those in Jerusalem, recite instead [...] "L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim hab'nuyah! - Next year in the rebuilt Jerusalem!" [...] Jerusalem is the holiest city in the Bible; it has become symbolic {{of the idea of}} spiritual perfection. [...] The tradition of saying [...] "Next year in Jerusalem" [...] is similar to the tradition of opening the door for Elijah: it recognizes that “this year” <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> imperfect world outside of “Jerusalem,” but we patiently await a time, hopefully “next year,” in which we live in spiritual perfection.|$|E
2500|$|Although Plato did {{not have}} an {{explicit}} theory of natural law (he rarely used the phrase 'natural law' except in Gorgias 484 and Timaeus 83e), his concept of nature, according to John Wild, contains some of the elements found in many natural law theories. According to Plato, <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> orderly universe. The basis of this orderly universe or nature are the forms, most fundamentally the Form of the Good, which Plato describes as [...] "the brightest region of Being". The Form of the Good is the cause of all things, and when it is seen it leads a person to act wisely. In the Symposium, the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful. In the Symposium, Plato describes how the experience of the Beautiful by Socrates enabled him to resist the temptations of wealth and sex. In the Republic, the ideal community is, [...] "...a city which would be established in accordance with nature." ...|$|E
