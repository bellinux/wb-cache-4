5|$|The Doctor {{finds the}} spaceship's crew long dead from {{exposure}} to a human virus. The trio then discover a sickbay where Avery's entire crew, Toby, and Rory are in medical care along with the TARDIS. The Siren {{turns out to be}} the ship's virtual doctor, caring for the injured humans; the black spots are tissue samples used as references. Amy convinces the Siren to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and his crew, unable to go back to England himself while the ship <b>will</b> <b>care</b> for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and his crew, sets off to explore the stars.|$|E

He is {{brought up in the}} house of Amergin and Findchóem on Muirthemne Plain in modern County Louth (at the time part of Ulster), alongside their son Conall Cernach.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who <b>will</b> <b>care</b> for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

Clay Basket {{wants to marry}} Alexander McKeag upon his return, but her father Lame Beaver says she should marry Pasquinel instead.

Back in St. Louis, Pasquinel and McKeag are confronted by the brother {{of one of the}} dead river pirates, who accuses them of killing his kin. Pasquinel feigns no involvement, but ends up getting into a bar brawl with the man. McKeag also fights {{with the rest of the}} man's friends.|$|E
25|$|Book Two opens {{during the}} high summer of 1915, with the {{establishment}} of the Armenian encampment and defenses, the Town Enclosure, Three Tent Square, South Bastion, Dish Terrace and other sites on Musa Dagh, that become familiar place names {{during the course of the}} novel. A division of labor is established, as to who will fight, who <b>will</b> <b>care</b> for livestock, who will make guns and munitions and so on. A communal society is established, despite the objections of the propertied class. The objective is to hold out long enough to attract the ships of the British and French navies, patrolling the eastern Mediterranean in support of the Allied invasion of Gallipoli.|$|E
500|$|Ellie Gibson of Eurogamer {{said that}} the {{characters}} were easy to sympathize with {{because they were so}} realistic. Edge claimed the characters [...] "sizzle with zip and pith", and praised the believable interactions between them. Ars Technica called the characters [...] "oddly human" [...] when discussing their realism. Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera also gave the voice acting high marks, claiming it set a new bar for video game voice acting. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer claimed simply that players <b>will</b> <b>care</b> about the fate of all the characters in the series.|$|E

500|$|Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "Cannibalizing John Carpenter's Thing {{and much of}} the sci-fi-horror canon, Afterlife is more moribund than its thronging undead". David Edwards of the Daily Mirror compared it to Resident Evil: Extinction, stating that the [...] "results are even less impressive, which is saying quite something" [...] and [...] "only fans of the series <b>will</b> <b>care</b> with the film looking suspiciously like a series of barely connected action scenes and unimpressive 3D welded to a who-the-hell-cares? plot". Spill.com critics Corey Koleman and Co-Host 3000 gave the film a [...] "Some ol' bullshit", the site's second lowest rating. They criticized the film's overuse of slow motion, lack of explanation of certain plot elements and long lapses in between action, but gave the film points for its cinematography, small bits of action, 3D and the special effects of the Axeman. Andrew Barker of Variety compared the film to the previous installment as [...] "equally moribund, and perhaps even more shamelessly derivative". He compared Roberts' Wesker to Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith from The Matrix, calling it a [...] "slipshod impression". A particularly scathing review came from Brian Orndorf of Dark Horizons, who commented: [...] "Perhaps the first 3D motion picture to simulate the experience of watching paint dry, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to life." ...|$|E
500|$|Brazilian Dreams {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Paula Edelstein of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, praising the performer skills [...] "leading his own ensembles or playing with renowned jazz masters, Paquito D'Rivera {{continues to make}} a decidedly fresh imprint on Latin and Brazilian jazz." [...] William Grim of All About Jazz wrote that Brazilian Dreams [...] was [...] "a very satisfying album" [...] hoping that D'Rivera, Roditi and the New York Voices record another album based on Brazilian music due to the large extension of the musical catalog of the country. C. Michael Bailey, also of All About Jazz, stated that the album [...] "is superb and fantastic in every way." [...] Morrice Blackwell of Jazz Review named the album a [...] "musical match made in heaven", praising the performers and the sound quality, considering {{that it is a}} live performance. Blackwell also commented on the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild which [...] "continually offer a complete jazz experience." [...] On a second review by Jazz Review, Lee Prosser referred to the album as a [...] "classic Brazilian music collection... something all jazz listeners can appreciate, enjoy, and want to have in their CD library collections", to finally declare that it was [...] "one of the very finest collections of music released in the year 2002." [...] Maurice Bottomley of PopMatters wrote that the record is [...] "gentle, cultured, and perhaps overly refined, but it is very accomplished and does actually swing," [...] further commenting that [...] "it is also truer to the spirit of bossa nova in its first North American flowering than some <b>will</b> <b>care</b> to admit." ...|$|E

This is how she escaped the Overlords' dormitories, conjuring a razor blade to cut a tracking device out of her wrist.

Against this backdrop, the Collegian under Sarmiento's leadership began to publish articles and editorials criticizing martial law and calling {{for the restoration of}} democracy. Sarmiento himself penned several editorials which he personally signed, concerning topics such as freedom of speech and of the press. He called on students to fight for the restoration of democratic rights and civil liberties. He urged his fellow students: [...] "Kung hindi tayo kikilos? Kung di tayo kikibo, sino ang kikibo?

Few <b>will</b> <b>care</b> that they died in a vicious assault {{that had nothing to do}} with stereotyping, Stand Your Ground self-defense, weak gun laws, insufficient federal civil-rights legislation, or any of the other causes of interracial violence falsely advanced by the attorney general—but quite a lot to do with an urban culture that for unspoken reasons has spawned an epidemic of disproportionate violent crime on the part of young African-American males." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Patrick Garratt {{scored the}} Xbox version 7 out of 10. Comparing the combat system to Final Fantasy X, he wrote [...] "it's a great formula [...] but there's {{nowhere near the}} depth." [...] However, he praised the {{graphics}} ("the presentation of the combat sequences will leave Tolkien fans in absolute ecstasy") and the story ("the story itself is actually very cool, and for LOTR fans the game will be a must-have for this alone. As the story is completely fresh and sits alongside the timeline of the films, playing The Third Age engenders the genuine excitement of playing pen and paper RPGs like Middle Earth"). He concluded [...] "The Third Age is a highly enjoyable, if throwaway foray {{into the world of}} the Lord of the Rings films, and has much to recommend it for a casual purchase, especially for Tolkien completists. But RPG mentalists will be bitter from the outset and <b>will</b> <b>care</b> little for the unparalleled presentation [...] This is a good game, it's just too shallow; an entry-level RPG at heart." ...|$|E
