60|$|General Buller made {{no attempt}} to harass the retreat of the Boers, {{although}} in two days no fewer than two thousand <b>wagons</b> were <b>counted</b> upon the roads to Newcastle and Dundee. The guns had been removed by train, the railway being afterwards destroyed. Across the north of Natal lies the chain of the Biggarsberg mountains, and to this the Transvaal Boers had retired, while the Freestaters had hurried through the passes of the Drakensberg in time to make the fruitless opposition to Roberts's march upon their capital. No accurate information had come in as to the strength of the Transvaalers, the estimates ranging from five to ten thousand, but it was known that their position was formidable and their guns mounted {{in such a way as}} to command the Dundee and Newcastle roads.|$|R

60|$|From Crowland the marauders proceeded, taking Turgar with them, {{to another}} large and wealthy abbey in the neighborhood, which they plundered and destroyed, {{as they had}} the abbey at Crowland. Sidroc made Turgar his own attendant, keeping him always near him. When the {{expedition}} had completed their second conquest, they packed the valuables which they had obtained from both abbeys in wagons, and moved toward the south. It happened {{that some of these}} <b>wagons</b> were under <b>Count</b> Sidroc's charge, and were {{in the rear of the}} line of march. In passing a ford, the wheels of one of these rear wagons sank in the muddy bottom, and the horses, in attempting to draw the wagon out, became entangled and restive. While Sidroc's whole attention was engrossed by this difficulty, Turgar contrived to steal away unobserved. He hid himself in a neighboring wood, and, with a degree of sagacity and discretion remarkable in a boy of his years, he contrived to find his way back to the smoking ruins of his home at the Abbey of Crowland.|$|R
25|$|In June 1793, Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine {{commanded}} the Army of the Ardennes which only numbered about 8,500 men at Sedan. Kilmaine proposed moving north from Givet against Liège while Beauregard moved east toward Arlon. In cooperation, the Army of the Moselle would advance on Arlon and capture its Coalition supply magazine. Jean Nicolas Houchard, {{the commander of}} the Army of the Moselle agreed to send Amable Henri Delaage with 10,500 men, but the force was only to hold the town for two days before withdrawing. Adam Philippe de Custine canceled Kilmaine's main offensive but allowed Beauregard to proceed with 2,000 soldiers. On 7 June Delaage's advanced guard appeared before Arlon but was repulsed. On the 8th Beauregard's column showed up and Delaage determined to try again. The French attacked on 9 June and defeated an Austrian division under Gottfried von Schroder. The Austrian force numbered 6,000 men in seven infantry battalions and eight cavalry squadrons. They sustained 600 casualties and lost five guns and four ammunition <b>wagons.</b> The French <b>counted</b> 900 killed and wounded out of 8,500 foot soldiers and 1,000 horsemen.|$|R
5000|$|Clayton is {{credited}} with inventing {{a version of the}} modern odometer, during this trip across the plains from Nauvoo, Illinois to Utah, with the help of apostle and mathematician Orson Pratt. Clayton was assigned to record the number of miles the company traveled each day. This was accomplished by tying a red flag onto one of the <b>wagon</b> wheels, and <b>counting</b> the revolutions. After three weeks, Clayton tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with Pratt, he developed a design consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism [...] "counting" [...] or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. The apparatus was built by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon. Clayton's journal records: [...] "About noon today Brother Appleton Harmon completed the machinery on the wagon called a 'roadometer' by adding a wheel to revolve once in ten miles, showing each mile and also each quarter mile we travel, and then casing the whole over so as to secure it from the weather." [...] The [...] "roadometer" [...] was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847.|$|R
5000|$|Mail and {{passenger}} stages usually went {{at night to}} avoid most of the slower (~3 mph) <b>wagon</b> traffic. As <b>counted</b> in 1862, {{the average number of}} passengers carried each day on the Placerville Routes Pioneer Stage Company line with 12 coaches and 600 horses averaged about 37 passengers/day. Horses were changed at roughly every 10-20 mile intervals and the drivers often vied to make the fastest time. A typical stage trip took approximately 18 hours from Placerville to Virginia City with an 18-hour return. Holdups, stage wrecks and other accidents were an occasional occurrence on both routes. In 1864, stage receipts were estimated by newspapers of the time to be about $527,000 at $27.00 per passenger on the Placerville route. The Henness Pass roads California Stage Company and Nevada Stage Line carried somewhat fewer passengers. Both stage coach routes together were estimated by newspapers of the day to have gross receipts, including mail subsidies, of over $1,000,000 total in 1864. The typical freight charges were about $120.00 to $160.00/ton (6-8 cents/pound) with am additional $20.00 to $30.00 toll charges/wagon. A Central Pacific Railroad agent (J. R. Atkins) estimated, after counting all Placerville toll road traffic in August and September 1862, that the freight charges to Virginia City over the Placerville route would have been about $5,000,000, which delivered roughly 20000000 lb of freight in eight weeks. Similar amounts presumable were shipped over the Henness pass route. In a given month during the busy season, over 2,000 wagons (sometimes up to three wagons were pulled by one team) and over 10,000 draft animals (mostly mules) per month were counted on the Placerville road alone in 1862. [...] The Placerville Route and Henness Pass route even had sprinkler wagons that wetted down the road during daylight hours about every three hours to minimize dust and wear and tear on the road. There were 93 hotels, stage relay stations and lodging stations located along the Placerville Route with similar stations along the Henness Pass route located at roughly ten mile (16 km) intervals. The teamsters stayed at these locations {{at the end of each}} days travel. The Placerville Route tried to stay open in winter to at least horse traffic and was only closed temporarily by winter storms. The Pony Express used this route in the summer and winter of 1860-61. The net profit per year from these toll roads was probably over $100,000/yr in 1862 and increasing every year.|$|R
