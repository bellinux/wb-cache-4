5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E

While passing through the islands, convection greatly increased, causing wind gusts of up to , though it remained disorganized. On August 22, convection organized while the system <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western Bahamas, and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only marginally favorable due to lack of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23.|$|E
5|$|After Ueshiba's {{death in}} 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant {{controversy}} arose with {{the departure of}} the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor Koichi Tohei, in 1974. Tohei left {{as a result of a}} disagreement with the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> proper role of ki development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido, and the organization that governs it, the Ki Society (Ki no Kenkyūkai).|$|E

She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> actress further denied {{that the reason for}} the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting {{in the middle of the}} relationship or reconciling with her former husband.|$|E

5|$|Early on October 22, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane {{started to}} issue special {{advisories}} {{to support the}} meteorological services of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone. As Xavier <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning, while cyclone watches were declared for Rennel, Bellona, and Vanuatu. During the next 24 hours, the Torres and Banks Islands, as well as Espirito Santo, Maewo, Ambae, were placed under a cyclone warning. The warnings for the Solomon Islands were then cancelled early the next day, while the warnings for Vanuatu were maintained until late on October 25, when RSMC Nadi discontinued them.|$|E
5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E

From then until after the war <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> small group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.|$|E

5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time.

5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> need for a strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce}} the federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{controversy}} of Sampson's administration <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{selection of the}} state's highway commissioner. The Highway Department employed over ten thousand people and spent nearly 45% of the state's budget. Legislators' votes could often be bought with promises of new road construction in their districts. Thus, the department became a primary vehicle for dispensing patronage to political supporters. Sampson's predecessor, Governor Fields, had chosen retired congressman and Democratic political boss Ben Johnson to head the department, and Sampson had agreed to retain him {{in exchange for his}} support against Beckham. However, Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not be left {{in the hands of a}} Democrat, and he removed Johnson from office in December 1929.|$|E
5|$|Twins were {{subjected}} to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes by Mengele {{or one of his}} assistants.
