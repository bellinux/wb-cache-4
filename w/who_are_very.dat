5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E

Keith informs his deputies that a robbery wave has been occurring. Piz interviews the student before telling Veronica {{that he has been}} offered an internship by Pitchfork Media. Veronica receives a 95% on the PI exam before being called by a man stating that Apollo is his son. Keith speaks to a suspect in some of the robberies and discovers that he is connected to the Fitzpatricks. Logan meets Parker’s (Julie Gonzalo) parents, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> uptight. Veronica speaks to Apollo, posing as a reporter for the school newspaper, finding that Apollo’s mother’s handwriting is very similar to the letter his father claimed to have from his mother.|$|E

25|$|Dependency: Hospitalized children, {{especially}} those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> young and/or nonverbal, {{are dependent on}} caregivers, parents, or other surrogates to convey key information associated with patient encounters.

In addition, because children are dependent on their caregivers, their care must be approved by parents or surrogates during all encounters.|$|E

25|$|Feminism {{seems to}} have become a {{priority}} of the state since 2000 with {{the foundation of the}} National Council for Women (NCW) <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> active in promoting women's rights in Egypt.

25|$|BMI is {{particularly}} inaccurate for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify {{them in the}} overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number. Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body fat, as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the body volume index.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} have an {{uncomplicated}} skin abscess should not use antibiotics. Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of cellulitis, symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing immunosuppression. People <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> young or very old may also need antibiotics. If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is {{in a place that}} is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.|$|E
25|$|Bottom-up {{processes}} include group composition, {{namely the}} characteristics of group members which are aggregated to the team level encompassing. An example of such bottom-up processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members. Furthermore, collective intelligence {{was found to be}} related to a group's cognitive diversity including thinking styles and perspectives. Groups that are moderately diverse in cognitive style have higher collective intelligence than those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> similar in cognitive style or very different. Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively.|$|E

25|$|While {{the stand}} off on O'Connell Street {{was still going}} on, several hundred rioters {{followed}} the Unionist coaches to the Nassau Street area where they set alight a number of cars and damaged several businesses. Again the attacks on cars and businesses in this area {{appears to have been}} entirely at random. On the other hand, the headquarters of the Progressive Democrats party (<b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> critical of the Irish Republican movement) on South Frederick Street off Nassau Street was also attacked, which seems to indicate at least some political motivation among the rioters. Further skirmishes broke out around the River Liffey at O'Connell Bridge, Aston Quay, Fleet Street and Temple Bar, as the Gardaí re-took O'Connell street, before the rioters dispersed. The most serious property damage was in the Nassau Street area, where three cars were burnt out, windscreens were smashed, and businesses had their windows broken. Many people also became trapped in shops and restaurants, including branches of McDonald's and Burger King.|$|E
25|$|Immobility is a {{significant}} risk factor {{in the development of}} thrombosis. Immediate post-surgical interventions,(out of bed orders (OOB), are typically ordered by the physician to prevent thrombosis. These orders are typically delegated to a nurse, but may include the participation of a physical therapist and others trained to perform the intervention. are to perform range of motion (ROM) activities that include: muscle contractions of the lower legs for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> weak, moving the feet, wiggling the toes, bending the knees, raise and lower the legs. In addition, changes in positioning prevents immobility and shifts areas of venous stasis. If the person is too weak to perform these preventative activities, hospital personnel will perform these movements independently. Exercise of the lower extremeties is a post-operative method of prophlaxsis. Nursing personnel will often perform range of motion exercises and encourage frequent moving of the legs, feet, and ankles. Frequent positioning changes and adequate fluid intake. After a surgical procedure, ambulation as soon as possible is prophylactic in preventing the formation of blood clots.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that between people, Ebola disease spreads only by {{direct contact with the}} blood or other body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease. Body fluids that may contain Ebola viruses include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine and semen. The WHO states that only people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> sick are able to spread Ebola disease in saliva, and whole virus has not been reported to be transmitted through sweat. Most people spread the virus through blood, feces and vomit. Entry points for the virus include the nose, mouth, eyes, open wounds, cuts and abrasions. Ebola may be spread through large droplets; however, this {{is believed}} to occur only when a person is very sick. This contamination can happen if a person is splashed with droplets. Contact with surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus, particularly needles and syringes, may also transmit the infection. The virus is able to survive on objects for a few hours in a dried state, and can survive for a few days within body fluids outside of a person.|$|E

25|$|Dahl also {{features}} in his books characters <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins {{are a few}} of these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge is featured in James and the Giant Peach and the nasty farmer Boggis in Fantastic Mr Fox is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from Willy Wonka's chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In Matilda, Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school. Featured in The Witches, Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. Dahl's mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in The BFG, the fox family in Fantastic Mr Fox and the trolls in The Minpins.|$|E

500|$|Depending {{on their}} {{language}} and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards. Visual scene displays {{have been used}} on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction. Approaches such as [...] "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" [...] train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation. Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia, especially with patients <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> severe. They can be produced at a very low tech level, and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures/words {{they are trying to}} say. Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs.|$|E
