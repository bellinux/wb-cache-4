500|$|After {{his death}} Huskisson's {{body had been}} moved from the sofa on which he had died to an upstairs bedroom. On arrival at the vicarage Emily Huskisson refused to allow the jury to view the body, insisting on being allowed to remain alone with her husband. Eventually {{she had to be}} {{forcibly}} removed from the room, and the jury <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> in small groups to view the body. As [...] "they did not think it necessary to look at the injured parts at all", they took only a brief glance at the body, and soon afterwards returned to the Grapes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Ford {{turned away}} without speaking, and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. George <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> {{to look at}} the tapestry. Two {{sides of}} the room were hung with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather is {{very ill}} to-night," [...] he whispered. [...] "You had better all <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> {{and leave me}} alone to watch by him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (She <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> MISS WILLOUGHBY {{gazes at}} MISS PHOEBE, who {{certainly}} shrinks. It has not escaped {{the notice of}} the visitor that MISS PHOEBE has become the more timid of the sisters, and she has evolved an explanation.) ...|$|R
50|$|When Bob returns home, Rita {{tells him}} that she is letting Sue move in with them. They go upstairs and Bob goes to get a bath. When he <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> he finds both girls semi-naked in his bed and the film ends with him diving onto the bed.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy frowned reflectively, as {{if there}} was {{something}} in what this novice suggested. He <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and returned wearing a pair of thin patent-leather shoes.|$|E
60|$|Carmina {{heard the}} pupils at the piano, {{while she was}} eating her luncheon. The profanation of music ceased, when she <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{to get ready for}} her daily drive.|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{took up a}} light, and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> it was empty. [...] "Sam, there's {{something}} wrong here!" [...] Tom said sharply, for a sudden sensation of alarm seized him. [...] "Peter is not here." ...|$|E
60|$|DANCY. [After a moment's silence] Go ahead! He <b>goes</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R
60|$|HODSON [appearing at <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door] Yes sir. [He {{turns to}} <b>go</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R
60|$|She <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>bedroom</b> and, {{taking up}} her bag, {{she got out}} a number of checks.|$|R
60|$|While he lighted {{the lamp}} in the parlor, Saxon was taking off her hat. He <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and lighted the lamp there, {{then turned back}} {{and stood in the}} doorway. Saxon, still unaccountably fumbling with her hatpins, stole a glance at him. He held out his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Bunny {{smoothed}} down {{a little}} before he left, and when he flew off I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to see poor little Sonny Bunny, though I was just fairly dying {{to know what it}} was Mr. Crow counted on doing to Jimmy, and why it was necessary for him to see Mr. Turtle.|$|E
60|$|Heyst <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> {{and shut}} the door after him with a bang. Coming from the light, he could not see a thing in there at first; yet he {{received}} the impression of the girl getting up from the floor. On the less opaque darkness of the shutter-hole, her head detached itself suddenly, very faint, a mere hint of a round, dark shape without a face.|$|E
60|$|DANCY. [Under his breath] No! No! By God! No! He <b>goes</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> closing <b>the</b> {{door behind}} him.|$|R
6000|$|MABEL passes him, and <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> Left. DANCY, left [...] alone, stands quite still, staring before him. With {{a sudden}} shrug [...] of his {{shoulders}} he moves quickly to his hat and takes it up just as [...] MABEL returns, ready to go out. He opens the door; and crossing [...] him, she stops in the doorway, looking up with a clear and trustful [...] gaze as ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! Write to her,--I don't {{know her}} full name, {{remember}},--and {{ask her to}} accept him out of pity. I believe you once told Dick you were sorry for him, Nilghai. You remember what happened, eh? <b>Go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and suggest full confession and an appeal to this Maisie girl, whoever she is. I honestly believe he'd try to kill you; and the blindness has made him rather muscular.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{after this}} fiasco I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and {{examined}} that also. The blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and discolourations, but undoubtedly fresh. The stick had been removed, {{but there also}} the marks were slight. There {{is no doubt about}} the stick belonging to our client. He admits it. Footmarks of both men could be made out on the carpet, but none of any third person, which again is a trick for the other side. They were piling up their score all the time and we were at a standstill.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was time}} to wake him, {{if we were to}} go to London that day. I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Although I was no doctor, the {{restorative}} importance of that profound and quiet sleep impressed itself on me so strongly, that I took the responsibility of leaving him undisturbed. The event proved that I had acted wisely. He slept until noon. There was no return of [...] "the torment of the voice"--as he called it, poor fellow. We passed a quiet day, excepting one little interruption, which I am warned not to pass over without a word of record in this narrative.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost at {{the same}} moment Colonel W. said, 'That's my brother John Wynyard, and I am sure he is dead'. Colonel W. was much agitated, and cried and sobbed a great deal. Sir John said, 'The fellow has a devilish good hat; I wish I had it'. (Hats were not to be got there and theirs were worn out.) They {{immediately}} got up (Sir John was on crutches, having broken his leg), took a candle and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> into which the figure had entered. They searched the bed and every corner of the room to no effect; the windows were fastened up with mortar. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... (Essie {{sits down}} miserably {{on the corner}} of the fender furthest from the door.) Never mind her, Mrs. Anderson: you know who she is and what she is. If she gives you any trouble, just tell me; and I'll settle {{accounts}} with her. (Mrs. Dudgeon <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> shutting <b>the</b> door sharply behind her as if even it had to be made to do its duty with a ruthless hand.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes! Write to her,--I don't {{know her}} full name, {{remember}},--and {{ask her to}} accept him out of pity. I believe you once told Dick you were sorry for him, Nilghai. You remember what happened, eh? <b>Go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and suggest full confession and an appeal to this Maisie girl, whoever she is.

50|$|After Shano had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> with <b>the</b> children, {{she heard}} Lane hitting Arwood. When {{she came out}} of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> Shano saw Sawyer drag Arwood by <b>the</b> hair <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bathroom. When Arwood would not get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bathtub, Sawyer kicked her in the chest, {{knocking}} her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tub, and hitting her head against the wall. Lane then pulled Arwood out of the bathtub and undressed her. The bathroom door was then closed for about twenty minutes.|$|R
60|$|Mildred <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to undo {{her things}} {{and put them}} away. Philip tried to read, but his spirits were too high: {{he leaned back in}} his chair, smoking a cigarette, and with smiling eyes looked at the {{sleeping}} child. He felt very happy. He was quite sure that he was not at all in love with Mildred. He was surprised that the old feeling had left him so completely; he discerned in himself a faint physical repulsion from her; and he thought that if he touched her it would give him goose-flesh. He could not understand himself. Presently, knocking at the door, she came in again.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} entered the room. Deep dusk reigned in there already. Lena, near the door, did not move or speak. The sheen of the white {{tablecloth}} was very obtrusive. The brute these two vagabonds had tamed had entered on its service while Heyst and Lena were away. The table was laid. Heyst {{walked up and down}} the room several times. The girl remained without sound or movement on the chair. But when Heyst, placing the two silver candelabra on the table, struck a match to light the candles, she got up suddenly and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> She came out again almost immediately, having taken off her hat. Heyst looked at her over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|It was, therefore, with {{a feeling}} of guilt and {{trepidation}} that Archie mounted the stairs on the following morning; for in spite of his good resolutions he was half an hour behind time. He was relieved to find that his friend had also lagged by the wayside. The door of the studio was ajar, and he went in, to discover the place occupied by a lady of mature years, who was scrubbing the floor with a mop. He <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and donned his bathing suit. When he emerged, ten minutes later, the charwoman had gone, but J. B. Wheeler was still absent. Rather glad of the respite, he sat down to kill time by reading the morning paper, whose sporting page alone he had managed to master at the breakfast table.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932 film [...] "The Purchase Price" [...] a {{group of}} married adults in a farming {{community}} have a party (to welcome mail order brides) and play post office. One of <b>the</b> women <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> a separate bedroom and then comes out to the main room and announces that there are x letters and y postcards for name. The man and woman <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and exchange presumably kisses and hugs, {{then return to the}} main room to general hilarity.|$|R
5000|$|Linet {{arrives at}} the house, where Dagger, disguised, convinces her to drink a potion. She does and it blurs her vision, while she dreamily <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Linet looks at Dagger in the nightcap and gown and utters the famous line: [...] "What big eyes you have." [...] When she notes the big teeth, Dagger says: [...] "The better to eat you with." [...] He then bites Linet's hand. Linet backs away in fear as Dagger {{transforms}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Wolf and pounces on her.|$|R
6000|$|They <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to get <b>the</b> trunk. CLARE {{picks up}} from [...] the floor the bunch of violets, her fingers {{play with it}} as if [...] they did not quite know what it was; and she stands by the [...] {{armchair}} very still, while MRS. MILER and the PORTER pass her [...] with trunk and bag. And even after the PORTER has shouldered [...] the trunk outside, and marched away, and MRS. MILER has come [...] back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, CLARE still stands there.|$|R
60|$|Obediently {{she got up}} and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> With a sick {{feeling in}} her heart, and as near the fire as she could get, she undressed with desperate haste, and got to bed. An age--it seemed--she lay there {{shivering}} in her flimsy lawn against the cold sheets, her eyes not quite closed, watching the flicker of the firelight. She did not think--could not--just lay stiller than the dead. The door creaked. She shut her eyes. Had she a heart at all? It did not seem to beat. She lay thus, with eyes shut, till she could bear it no longer. By the firelight she saw him crouching {{at the foot of the}} bed; could just see his face--like a face--a face--where seen? Ah yes!--a picture--of a wild man crouching at the feet of Iphigenia--so humble, so hungry--so lost in gazing. She gave a little smothered sob and held out her hand.|$|E
60|$|She had {{a strange}} feeling of loss of self, of being a {{stranger}} to herself, and {{the world in which}} she moved seemed a vague and shrouded world. It lacked sharpness of definition. Its customary vividness was gone. She had lapses of memory, and was continually finding herself doing unplanned things. Thus, to her astonishment, she came to in the back yard hanging up the week's wash. She had no recollection of having done it, yet it had been done precisely as it should have been done. She had boiled the sheets and pillow-slips and the table linen. Billy's woolens had been washed in warm water only, with the home-made soap, the recipe of which Mercedes had given her. On investigation, she found she had eaten a mutton chop for breakfast. This meant that she had been to the butcher shop, yet she had no memory of having gone. Curiously, she <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> The bed was made up and everything in order.|$|E
60|$|Lindy was in {{the front}} room with the negress whom Madame had brought with her. They were not talking. I {{supposed}} then this was because Lindy did not speak French. I did not know that Madame de Montmery's maid was a mute. Both of them <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and I was left alone. The door and windows were closed, and a green myrtle-berry candle was burning on the table. I looked about me with astonishment. But for the low ceiling and the wide cypress puncheons of the floor the room might have been a boudoir in a manor-house. On the slender-legged, polished mahogany table lay books in tasteful bindings; a diamond-paned bookcase stood in the corner; a fauteuil and various other chairs which might have come from the hands of an Adam were ranged about. Tall silver candlesticks graced each end of the little mantel-shelf, and between them were two Lowestoft vases having the Temple coat of arms.|$|E
50|$|Lila and David host {{a dinner}} party with two couples. During the dinner party, Lila reveals that David is writing a children's story. As she {{describes}} {{the plot of the}} story, it becomes clear that she and David are twins. After one couple leaves, Lila seduces the woman in the second couple. As the man joins the two of them in a ménage à trois, David sets up the video camera. He gets a kitchen knife and <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where <b>the</b> couple start screaming.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} easy, sir, {{if you must}} know. I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vacant <b>bedroom</b> next to your room, climbed from one window to the other, and the trick was done." ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> CLARE gets up {{and stands}} by the fire, [...] looking round in a dazed way. She puts her hand up and [...] {{mechanically}} gathers together the violets in the little vase. [...] Suddenly she twists them to a buttonhole, and sinks down <b>into</b> [...] <b>the</b> armchair, which he must pass. There she sits, the violets [...] in her hand. MALISE comes out and crosses towards the outer [...] door. She puts the violets up to him. He stares at them, [...] shrugs his shoulders, and passes on. For just a moment CLARE [...] sits motionless.|$|R
