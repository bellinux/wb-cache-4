500|$|Throughout the game, a [...] "personality transfer" [...] {{phenomenon}} frequently causes Cocoro's and Satoru's {{minds to}} switch places with each other, leaving {{them in the}} other person's body. As the player only learns what their current character experiences, they need {{to play the game}} as both characters in order to access all information. Choices the player makes as one of the characters also affect what happens in a playthrough as the other; for instance, if the player chooses to drink water as Satoru, there will be no water left if they play through the game as Cocoro, and if they get into an argument with a character as Cocoro, their relationship to that character becomes strained <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>play</b> the game as Satoru.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jakob Dorof of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "Hands All Over" [...] is [...] "the one real gamble"; {{despite the fact}} that it tries to hard to find a missing connection between the works of Prince, Queen and Nine Inch Nails, [...] "it's certainly one of the more interesting things the band has ever recorded." [...] Similarly, McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that on songs like [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Stutter", the Maroon 5 shows a band [...] "who are really at their best <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>play</b> pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are." [...] Contactmusic's Banimaer stated that although the track is a little repetitive, it shows what kind of band Maroon 5 wants to be.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by Badu's {{creativity}} and their time listening to music, Chavarria added special effects and delays to the tracks by using and manipulating {{a variety of}} plug-ins and guitar pedals, subsequently reworking effects frequency and modulation parameters. Chavarria said {{they were able to}} expand on the producers' tracks rather than change them, because [...] "Erykah made this record to display to the world that there is this whole group of producers out there who are outside of the mainstream making great music." [...] Badu said of the approach, [...] "I work in layers. The first layer is the track. The second layer is the songs. The third would be the musicians who add a certain nuance. And <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>play,</b> they play like they are a sample. Or we take a piece of what they played, and we sample and loop it." ...|$|E

I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>play</b> it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on."

When Peter goes to look at his secret stash of pornography, the intro from Get Smart is referenced. Stewie asks Brian if Jillian has an alibi, and Brian says no. [...] Stewie starts singing the song [...] "U.G.L.Y.", understanding that Jillian does not have an alibi. Brian sets up a cutaway when he says that breaking up with Jillian will be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin.

2500|$|While the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony {{reasoned}} that because younger players typically {{look up to}} older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. [...] Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, [...] "One {{of the first things}} we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>play</b> videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again."
