5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised <b>within</b> <b>an</b> individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{atmospheric}} convection developed and persisted on December 21 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal forming <b>within</b> <b>an</b> active near-equatorial trough. Located <b>within</b> <b>an</b> area of weak vertical wind shear, the system steadily organized, and after initially remaining nearly stationary it began to move slowly westward. Deep convection continued to develop, and on December 23 a mid-level circulation began to form. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. By {{the night of the}} December 23, a low-level circulation developed in the system, located to the south of the deep convection. The disturbance continued to organize, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classifying it as a deep depression early on December 24. Later that day, the organization of the system degraded slightly, though it quickly reorganized. On December 25, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 04B while it was located about 155miles (250km) east of Sri Lanka. On the center's first advisory, the tropical storm was drifting west-northwest at 3mph (5km/h) with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h). Shortly thereafter, the IMD upgraded the deep depression to a cyclonic storm as a central dense overcast developed over the center.|$|E
