5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine <b>wisdom,</b> <b>is</b> {{the source of}} the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived {{in an age of}} spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of <b>wisdom,</b> <b>is</b> hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} analysts have {{suggested}} that WASP dominance of the institutional order has become {{a thing of the}} past. The accepted <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that after World War II, the selection of individuals for leadership positions was increasingly based on factors such as motivation and training rather than ethnicity and social lineage.|$|E
50|$|In 832 AD, Caliph al-Ma'mūn {{founded the}} famous House of Wisdom. There {{the methods of}} Gondeshapur were emulated; indeed, the House of <b>Wisdom</b> <b>was</b> staffed with {{graduates}} of the older Academy of Gondeshapur. It is believed that the House of <b>Wisdom</b> <b>was</b> disbanded under Al-Mutawakkil, al-Ma'mūn's successor.|$|R

25|$|<b>Wisdom</b> <b>is</b> {{known for}} Cub World, Circle Ten's primary Cub leader {{training}} site and Cub Scout camp ground. Wisdom also hosts leadership training {{for adults and}} youth owing, in part, to the easy access from the Dallas metropolitan area. The camp lends its name to Camp Wisdom Road, a major east–west road near the camp.|$|E
25|$|A {{slightly}} later work, The Ancient of Atlantis (Boston, 1915) by Albert Armstrong Manship, expounds the Atlantean {{wisdom that}} is to redeem the earth. Its three parts consist of a verse narrative of the life and training of an Atlantean wise one, followed by his Utopian moral teachings and then a psychic drama set in modern times in which a reincarnated child embodying the lost <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> reborn on earth.|$|E
25|$|Pentecostals {{understand}} {{the word of}} wisdom and the word of knowledge to be supernatural revelations of wisdom and knowledge by the Holy Spirit. The word of <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> defined as a revelation of the Holy Spirit that applies scriptural wisdom to a specific situation that a Christian community faces. The word of knowledge is often defined as the ability of one person to know what God is currently doing or intends {{to do in the}} life of another person.|$|E

25|$|Wisdom, or the {{capacity}} for insight and judgment that is developed through experience, increases {{between the ages of}} fourteen and twenty-five, then levels off. Thus, it is during the adolescence-adulthood transition that individuals acquire the type of wisdom that is associated with age. <b>Wisdom</b> <b>is</b> not the same as intelligence: adolescents do not improve substantially on IQ tests since their scores are relative to others in their same age group, and relative standing usually does not change—everyone matures at approximately the same rate in this way.|$|E
25|$|Astrology (the {{operation}} of the stars): Hermes claims that Zoroaster discovered {{this part of the}} wisdom of the whole universe, astrology, and taught it to man. In Hermetic thought, {{it is likely that the}} movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of The All, or God. Astrology has influences upon the Earth, but does not dictate our actions, and <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> gained when we know what these influences are and how to deal with them.|$|E
25|$|According to Mahayana sutras, Gautama Buddha always {{maintained}} that lay persons {{were capable of}} great wisdom and of reaching enlightenment. In some areas {{there has been a}} misconception that Theravada regards enlightenment to be an impossible goal for those outside the Sangha, but in Theravada suttas it is clearly recorded that the Buddha's uncle, a lay follower, reached enlightenment by hearing the Buddha's discourse, and there are many other such instances described in the Pāli Canon. Accordingly, emphasis on lay persons, as well as Sangha members, practicing the Buddhist path of morality, meditation, and <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> present in all major Buddhist schools.|$|E

25|$|The major overt {{purpose of}} the account of Solomon's reign, to which the Judgment of Solomon belongs as stated above, is to glorify King Solomon, and his <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> one of the account's {{dominant}} themes. The exceptions are: The first two chapters (1 Kings 1–2), which according to many scholars portray a dubious image of Solomon, and as stated above, are sometimes ascribed to a separate work; And the last chapter in the account (11), which describes Solomon's sins in his old age. Nevertheless, many scholars point out to elements in the account that criticize Solomon, anticipating his downfall in chapter 11.|$|E
25|$|Souls {{then begin}} cycles of reincarnation. It {{generally}} takes 10,000 {{years for a}} soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life {{three times in a}} row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.|$|E
25|$|That project aims at {{registering}} {{a complete}} {{range of values}} with which people identify, {{to which they are}} attracted or which they reject as abhorrent. The notion of <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> explored as a way, an art, of dealing with value dilemmas. For instance, Complexity: understanding value systems is a text that looks at values through a positive interpretation, a negative interpretation, a paradoxical negative interpretation of the positive, and a paradoxical positive interpretation of the negative. Another text, Insights: wisdom and requisite variety, gives a list of several sources of wisdom which, in interrelation, may be required in a value system to ensure the long-term viability of a complex society.|$|E

25|$|The John Ray Initiative (JRI) is an {{educational}} charity {{with a vision}} to bring together scientific and Christian understandings of the environment {{in a way that}} can be widely communicated and lead to effective action. It was formed in 1997 in recognition of the urgent need to respond to the global environmental crisis and the challenges of sustainable development and environmental stewardship. John Ray's writings proclaimed God as creator whose <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> ‘manifest in the works of creation’, and as redeemer of all things. Inspired by Ray, JRI seeks to teach appreciation of nature, increase awareness {{of the state of the}} global environment and communicate a Christian understanding of environmental issues.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{states that}} in the Nikayas, right-view {{includes}} non-dependence on knowledge and views, and mentions the Buddha's simile of his dhamma as a raft that must be abandoned. He finds that the Atthakavagga's treatment of knowledge and <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> parallel to the later Patthana's apparent criticism of giving, holding the precepts, the duty of observance, and practicing the jhanas. In his view, both texts exhibit this particular approach not as an attack on practice or knowledge, but {{to point out that}} attachment to the path is destructive. Similarly, the text's treatment of concentration meditation is intended to warn against attachment to insight, and communicate that insight into the nature of things necessarily involves a calm mind.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no trace}} of reason in God because reason is desire and God lacks nothing. Adam was not created in reason. Had it been otherwise, his problem could have been healed by natural {{learning}} {{and there would be}} no need of Christ and no need of faith. The worldly case against reason is that its products do not last: a great remedy for some human problem is devised but soon lost patience with and a new novelty is again demanded. Thus thy <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> thy woe. Reason should not be discarded but placed as subservient to faith. Reason, like fire and water, is a bad master but a good servant. Above all, one cannot use reason to seek out the Lord.|$|E
