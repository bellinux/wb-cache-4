5|$|After the 1928hurricane, {{the bodies}} buried at that {{location}} became mostly forgotten by the public. The city of <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> sold {{the land and}} it continued to change ownership into the 1980s. Beginning in 1991, a movement to convince the city of <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> to repurchase the property began, which succeeded in December2000. On September12, 2002, it {{was added to the}} US National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, {{the parking lot was}} flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major washout was reported in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> at the intersection of State Roads 80 and 882. Also in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach,</b> a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a portion of it became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> after driving through the storm and crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95. Several major and minor roads were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach,</b> established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.|$|E

The Trauma Hawk program, established in November 1990, replaced the use of <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> County Sheriff's Office helicopters to medevac critically injured patients to area hospitals. At the Trauma Hawk Station, located at the south <b>west</b> corner of <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> International Airport, the department has two Sikorsky S-76C helos. The air ambulances are identically equipped and can carry two patients each and up to four medical attendants if needed.

5|$|The 1928 Okeechobee {{hurricane}} caused {{at least}} 2,500deaths, {{most of which}} were migrant, black farmer workers around Lake Okeechobee. Due to racial segregation at the time, the coffins provided were used for the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach.</b> The bodies of the black people who were killed, and some of those whose race could not be identified, were disposed of by other means. Some were burned in funeral pyres, while many were placed into mass graves, including about 1,600 in Port Mayaca, 674 at the pauper's cemetery in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach,</b> at least 22 in Miami Locks (now known as Lake Harbor), 28 in Ortona, and 22 in Sebring. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies buried in Loxahatchee. After the burials were complete, then-Mayor of <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> Vincent Oaksmith proclaimed an hour of mourning on October1 for those who died during the storm. A funeral service was hosted by several local clergymen. Roughly 3,000 people attended, including educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune. A memorial was placed at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory of the victims of the storm, but no such marker was placed at the pauper's cemetery.|$|E

5|$|At <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach,</b> the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on September10, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm signals, {{equivalent}} to a tropical storm warning in , from Cedar Key, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. These were later upgraded to hurricane warnings in South Florida. Due to inclement weather conditions in <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach,</b> which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended their normal operations and people boarded up buildings, even as the strongest winds arrived. As the cyclone moved into the Gulf of Mexico, reports from September 12 through September 14 helped ships prepare for the storm.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the point}} of its first landfall, few {{structures}} were destroyed and ocean overwash across the barrier island was limited, though {{the extent of the}} damage far exceeded that of Hurricane Charley. Wind damage to citrus groves led to a near total loss near the coast of east-central Florida between <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> and Melbourne, with lesser damage farther to the west across the Kissimmee River basin. Between Hurricane Charley and Frances, citrus losses totaled $2billion (2004 dollars). Significant tree damage was reported within golf courses along the Treasure Coast, with an average of 300-500 trees experiencing damage per course.|$|E

5|$|The {{metropolitan}} areas of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and <b>West</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> {{are located on}} a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida, called the Eastern Coastal Ridge, that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation.

This slight rise in elevation {{on both sides of}} the Everglades creates a basin, and forces water that overflows Lake Okeechobee to creep toward the southwest.|$|E
