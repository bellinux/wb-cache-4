25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{if a child is}} {{intelligent}} enough to ask the four questions, the child asks them. If the child is not intelligent enough, the wife asks them. If the <b>wife</b> <b>does</b> not ask the questions, the leader of the seder asks them. And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must ask one another (if no one else can ask).|$|E
25|$|Hadith (reports of Muhammad's sayings {{and deeds}} from {{those close to}} him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with {{different}} writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways. Shariah (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars. In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and {{an increasing number of}} Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance. For sodomy within marriage, the majority of Shiite interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not haram (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the <b>wife</b> <b>does</b> not agree, then it is preferable to refrain.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally in Iran, the <b>wife</b> <b>does</b> {{not take}} her husband's surname, {{although}} children take the surname of their father. Individual reactions notwithstanding, {{it is possible}} to call a married woman by her husband's surname. This is facilitated by the fact that English words [...] "Mrs.", [...] "Miss", [...] "Woman", [...] "Lady" [...] and [...] "Wife (of)" [...] in a polite context are all translated into [...] "خانم" [...] (Khaanom). Context, however, is important: [...] "خانم گلدوست" [...] (Khaanom Goldust) may, for instance, refer to the daughter of Mr. Goldust instead of his wife.|$|E
2500|$|Within marriage, regular sexual {{relations}} are expected and encouraged. [...] "The husband should give {{to his wife}} her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the <b>wife</b> <b>does</b> not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does." [...] As “one flesh,” {{the husband and wife}} share this right and privilege; the New Testament does not portray intimacy as something held in reserve by each spouse to be shared on condition. [...] "Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control." [...] A stated reason for maintaining marital relations is to reduce the temptation to adultery.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Mitchell — Age 32, [...] Dennis' {{father is}} a workaday {{aerospace}} engineer. Henry seems to understand Dennis more than his <b>wife</b> <b>does,</b> especially in affairs of the heart. One example was when a furious Dennis stormed in, saying, [...] "Wimmin can say some of the stupidest things!"; Henry knowingly said to Alice, [...] "Margaret." [...] Another time, while Dennis was watching Gina, he confided to his dad, [...] "There's somethin' about Gina that I can't figger out." [...] Henry wisely advised his son, [...] "Wait." [...] Again, Henry and Alice overhear Dennis tell Gina that she [...] "smelled better than a plateful of peanut butter samwiches". Henry remarks, [...] "The ultimate compliment." [...] Like his creator Hank Ketcham, Henry served in the US Navy; his position was [...] as a quartermaster (Helmsman) 2nd class on a battleship. Sometimes, he and Alice will get into arguments (which even show his chauvinistic side at times); however, they remain devoted to each other. Among his hobbies are golf, taking naps, fishing, and playing the ukulele and singing old songs with George Wilson. A running gag is that Henry often plays the straight man dupe — either resulting from Dennis's pranks, or because of his own foolishness; once he tried to save money on a Christmas tree by cutting one down in the country — and ended up paying $20.00 ($10.00 for a fine and $10.00 for the owner charging him for the tree).|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} it was common to marry off daughters quite young, as soon as a {{suitable}} husband could be found and a dowry put together. [...] Combined with childhood diseases and a high general mortality rate this meant that it was not uncommon for young people to die within a short time of marriage, before their spouses had formed lasting relationships with their families. [...] Under Jewish inheritance law, a husband is his wife's sole heir, but a <b>wife</b> <b>does</b> not inherit from her husband. Thus, no matter who died, the dowry, which represented a substantial sacrifice by the wife's parents for their daughter's happiness, would end up with the husband or his family. As a result, parents became reluctant to give their daughters large dowries, which in turn led to difficulty in finding them husbands. Therefore the synod of Troyes, led by Rabbenu Tam, decreed that if a husband or wife dies within a year of marriage without leaving a surviving child, the dowry would revert to the parents who had given it; if the death was within two years half the dowry would revert. While Rabbenu Tam rescinded this decree before his death, it was reaffirmed by his students in the first synod of SHUM. This decree is today incorporated by reference into the standard Ashkenazi prenuptial contract (tena'im), with the phrase [...] "and in case of absence [...] it will stand as the decree of ShUM"; in some communities even this elliptical mention of death is thought unlucky at a wedding, so it is merely hinted at with the cryptic phrase [...] "and in case, etc." [...] Even if it is not explicitly referenced at all, or if there is no contract, it is assumed that the parties consented to it unless it is explicitly excluded.|$|E
