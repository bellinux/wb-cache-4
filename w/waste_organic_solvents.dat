It is estimated that only a small portion, less than 4 %, of all the organic solvents consumed in Hong Kong are collected as waste solvents and properly treated, while the remainder are used either in the formulation of solvent containing products, or are lost to the environment through vapour emissions, leaks and spills, or dumped illegally. It was found that solvent recycling has been a common practice in some industries but the existing level of solvent recycling in Hong Kong is difficult to estimate.

Environmental impact associated with fuel use and reprocessing can be minimised by addressing either of these requirements. Semiconductor particles and films may act as efficient photocatalysts for a range of environmentally and industrially useful reactions including heavy metal recovery from effluent streams by manipulation of the metal valence state. The manipulation of actinide metal ion oxidation states {{plays an important role in}} nuclear fuel and materials processing. Thus, this review explores the potential use of heterogeneous photocatalysis in actinide valence state control in the context of actinide photochemistry and minimised primary and secondary waste management requirements in the plutonium-uranium reduction extraction (PUREX) nuclear fuel processing route. Criteria are defined for the selection of heterogeneous semiconductor catalysts and sacrificial charge scavengers for use within reprocessing scenarios and two main applications discussed: (1) the photocatalytic control of the neptunium ion oxidation state and consequent separation of Np from Pu and U; and (2) the photocatalytic control of U and Pu ion oxidation states and their consequent separation from each other. A quantum efficiency, phi, of 0. 27 is reported for the photocatalytic reduction of the Pu(IV) simulant, Ce 4 + to Ce 3 + at PH 0.

Fresh prawn bio-waste contains protein, astaxanthin, flavor compounds and chitin. The use of chitin in various applications is limited due to its water insolubility. In this research, a new method is developed to prepare water-soluble colloidal chitin (WSCC) from prawn waste. WSCC having the percentage of degree of deacetylation same with that of chitin follows non-newtonian shear thinning behaviour. The characteristic study showed that the breakage of polymer chains during processing thus reduced the molecular weight and bulk density of WSCC. Therefore, functional properties of WSCC can be controlled by optimizing the processing conditions. Astaxanthin complex has attracted considerable interest in relation to its health benefits because of its powerful antioxidant activity. Traditional extraction of astaxanthin complex from prawn <b>waste</b> using <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> requires post-purification steps, creates solvent disposal problem and degrades the pigment. This research develops an efficient way of recovering astaxanthin complex from prawn waste that eliminates the problems associated with solvent extraction methods and offers possible recyclability of the solvents used. Post-harvest blackening in prawns adversely affects both quality and consumer acceptability. However, consumer safety over the chemicals, especially sulphites used in inhibiting prawn blackening is of a major concern. This study shows that the antioxidant, astaxanthin complex can inhibit the poly phenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzed blackening reaction in prawns. Although prawns have astaxanthin complex present in their natural state, its concentration in vivo may not be sufficient to act against PPO. Therefore, astaxanthin complex-enriched feed in prawn culture may prevent prawn melanosis and may eliminate the post-harvest handling methods...|$|R

40|$|The Office of Waste Processing, {{within the}} Office of Technology Innovation and Development, is funding the {{development}} of an enhanced solvent - also known as the next generation solvent (NGS) - for deployment at the Savannah River Site to remove cesium from High Level Waste. The technical effort is a collaborative effort between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). As part of the program, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has performed a number of Extraction-Scrub-Strip (ESS) tests. These batch contact tests serve as first indicators of the cesium mass transfer solvent performance with actual or simulated waste. The test detailed in this report used simulated Tank 49 H material, with the addition of extra potassium. The potassium was added at 1677 mg/L, the maximum projected (i. e., a worst case feed scenario) value for the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF). The results of the test gave favorable results given that the potassium concentration was elevated (1677 mg/L compared to the current 513 mg/L). The cesium distribution value, DCs, for extraction was 57. 1. As a comparison, a typical D{sub Cs} in an ESS test, using the baseline solvent formulation and the typical waste feed, is {approx} 15. The Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) uses the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) process to remove cesium (Cs) from alkaline waste. This process involves the use of an organic extractant, BoBCalixC 6, in an organic matrix to selectively remove cesium from the caustic <b>waste.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> mixture flows counter-current to the caustic aqueous waste stream within centrifugal contactors. After extracting the cesium, the loaded solvent is stripped of cesium by contact with dilute nitric acid and the cesium concentrate is transferred to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), while the <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> is cleaned and recycled for further use. The Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF), under construction, will use the same process chemistry. The Office of Waste Processing (EM- 31) expressed an interest in investigating the further optimization of the <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> by replacing the BoBCalixC 6 extractant with a more efficient extractant. This replacement should yield dividends in improving cesium removal from the caustic waste stream, and in {{the rate at which the}} caustic waste can be processed.

Results: In the present study, the frequency of spontaneous abortion in employees with exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mixture was 10. 7 %. This study showed that even after adjustment for confounding factors, there was a significant correlation between spontaneous abortion and occupational exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mixture and this correlation increased with increasing levels of exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between occupational exposure to mixed <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> and waiting time to become pregnant (TTP).

40|$|There is a {{necessity}} for portable and relatively cheap device {{which could be used}} for rapid, reversible and in-situ volatile organic compound detection. We offer a polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon composite (PNCC) us a promising material for <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour detection and identification in the environment. Previously obtained experimental results verify that PNCC can distinguish 10 different <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> saturated vapour. When PNCC is exposed to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour, molecules of vapour adsorbe {{on the surface of the}} composite and diffuse into matrix material. At the same time decreases the tunnelling currents between carbon aggregates in thin layers of matrix and the electrical resistance of the composite increases. In the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour electric resistance changes remarkably in short time (30 s) and the effect is reversible. The largest electric resistance change velocity (vR) is observed for tetrahydrofuran (0, 19404 KÎ©/min), benzene (0, 13082 KÎ©/min) and ethylacetate (0, 10694 KÎ©/min) vapour. But nearly no vR change is observed, when PNCC is exposed to propanol vapour (0, 004028 KÎ©/min). We relate this variant electric resistance response of PNCC to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour variant compatibility with the composites matrix material (polyisoprene) and variant <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour molecule dimensions. To evaluate vapour compatibility with the composite matrix material we compared dielectric permeability values of vapour (Îµv) and polyisoprene (Îµp). We observed that larger vR change is reached when Îµv value is close to Îµp (2, 68) value. PNCC <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour sensitivity is selective. The composite does not respond or respond weakly to polar <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour presence. Also in the electric resistance response evaluation of PNCC molecule dimensions of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour should be taken into account. As smaller the diameter of vapour and better compatibility with matrix material us greater electric resistance response of PNCC is observed...|$|R
