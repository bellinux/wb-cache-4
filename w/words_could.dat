5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty <b>words</b> <b>could</b> be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} {{circles in}} The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' <b>words</b> <b>could</b> endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international public does not know who is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E
5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that <b>words</b> <b>could</b> be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E

5|$|During {{the run of}} Iolanthe, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert {{that had}} earned him the {{broadest}} fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should {{put an end to}} his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's <b>words</b> <b>could</b> be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after Iolanthe opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.|$|E
5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his <b>words</b> <b>could</b> not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} – {{most notably}} Lajos Ligeti (1950/51) and Edwin G. Pulleyblank (1962) – {{have claimed that}} languages of Siberia, especially Ket – {{a member of the}} Yeniseian language family – may have been a major source (or perhaps even the linguistic core) of the Xiongnu and/or Hunnic languages. Marácz claimed, however, that any purportedly Yeniseian <b>words</b> <b>could</b> also have Mongolian and/or Turkic origins.|$|E
25|$|By 1850, however, Edward Hincks came {{to suspect}} a non-Semitic origin for cuneiform. Semitic {{languages}} are structured according to consonantal forms, whereas cuneiform, when functioning phonetically, was a syllabary, binding consonants to particular vowels. Furthermore, no Semitic <b>words</b> <b>could</b> {{be found to}} explain the syllabic values given to particular signs. Julius Oppert suggested that a non-Semitic language had preceded Akkadian in Mesopotamia, and that speakers of this language had developed the cuneiform script.|$|E
25|$|Brasseur {{began to}} write about Atlantis in his {{publication}} Grammaire de la langue quichée (1862), in which he expressed his belief that the lost land described by Plato had existed with an advanced degree of civilization {{before the beginning of}} civilizations in Europe and Asia. He suggested that the origins of European and Persian <b>words</b> <b>could</b> be traced to indigenous languages of the Americas and that the ancient cultures of the New and Old Worlds had been in constant communication with one another.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{elements}} of art—the line, particle of color—like <b>words</b> <b>could</b> be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, {{in addition to the}} particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting affect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} Britons and the settled Danes, {{some of the}} other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms disliked being ruled by Wessex. Consequently, the death of a Wessex king would be {{followed}} by rebellion, particularly in Northumbria. In 973, Alfred's great-grandson, Edgar, was crowned King of England and Emperor of Britain at Bath. On his coinage he had inscribed EADGAR REX ANGLORUM ("Edgar, King of the English"). Edgar's coronation was a magnificent affair, and many of its rituals and <b>words</b> <b>could</b> still be seen in the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, though in English rather than Latin.|$|E

In 2011, Rolling Stone also placed it at number eight on their 100 Best Albums of the Nineties list, and described it as [...] "mapping out the sound of 'Nineties cool".
