For mechanical parts, standard use for {{description of product}} data is ISO 10303 - Product data representation and exchange, also known as STEP. This make possible to use standard data during design, process planning and production stage to integrate CAD and CAM. The main barriers to realizing this concept is most of computer numerical control (CNC) machines, which use ISO 6983 G/M codes language. G/M codes lack the portability because of the following reasons. First it focus only on tool center path rather than machining process, second some vendors use language supplement with their own extensions programme which make it ambiguous. ISO 14649 called as STEP-NC is a new standards which extend STEP standard for NC. STEP-NC replaces G/M codes by remedies the above shortcomings. STEP-NC specifying machining processes rather than machine tool motion, using the concept of <b>working</b> <b>steps.</b> <b>Working</b> <b>steps</b> correspond to high-level machining features and associated process parameters.

R-wave synchronized atrial (AVT) pacing is used {{to re-establish}} atrioventricular synchrony. AVT pacing is complex, with technical pitfalls. We sought to establish and to test a low-cost simulation model suitable for training and analysis in AVT pacing. A simulation model was developed based on a JET simulator, a simulation doll, a cardiac monitor, and a pacemaker. A computer program simulated electrocardiograms. Ten experienced pediatric cardiologists tested the model. Their performance was analyzed using a testing protocol with 10 <b>working</b> <b>steps.</b> Four testers found the simulation model realistic; 6 found it very realistic. Nine claimed that the trial had improved their skills. All testers considered the model useful in teaching AVT pacing. The simulation test identified 5 <b>working</b> <b>steps</b> in which major mistakes in performance test may impede safe and effective AVT pacing and thus permitted specific training.

40|$|Many {{initiatives}} {{executed by}} local authority {{to ensure their}} service will improve continuously. Those initiatives were involving various actions implemented by local authority including setup the property management division in each organisations. Local authority property management division (LAPMD) is a divison that usually been given the responsibility to manage local authority properties. Nevertheless, the roles that have been played by these divisions are not uniformed for they have diversified objectives and functions and also different from each other. This situation occurs from a condition where these departments were first established {{to have their own}} benefits thus leaving behind the needs for a uniform organisational foundation. Therefore, this non unified condition has led to various negative effects particularly to local authority organisations themselves hence showing that their practice in managing property is still at an unsatisfactory level. On the other hand, this research is carried out to help achieve four main objectives among which are to identify the needs for establishing the LAPMD, to identify the motive in determining the objectives of LAPMD, to identify the main functions of LAPMD and to develop frameworks in deploying each main function. This research has been done in four levels of execution which are literature review, pilot study, survey study and benchmarking study. Data gathered from this research has been analysed through qualitative and quantitative approaches which includes Alpha Cronbach analysis, Mann-Whitney analysis, Kruskal-Wallis analysis, frequency analysis, min analysis, correlation analysis and content analysis. The research findings have identified seven factors that can be considered as the needs for the establishment of LAPMD. Their service motives can be concluded as the most important for LAPMD objectives. On the other hand, tenancy management function and maintenance management function have been identified as two main functions of LAPMD. Furthermore, this research has developed a framework for the tenancy management function with 16 <b>working</b> <b>steps</b> and also a framework for maintenance management function with 18 <b>working</b> <b>steps.</b> All <b>working</b> <b>steps</b> have been categorised under four basic management processes among which are planning, organising, executing and controlling...|$|E
