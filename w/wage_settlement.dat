The relation is always negative for strike probabilities. We also find that the relation between the trade-adjusted percent of the product market covered by the same union and the percentage covered by other union are positively related to both <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> and strike probabilities.

The NRA tried to get the principals to compromise with a national code for a decentralized industry in which many companies were anti-union, sought to keep wage differentials, and tried to escape the collective bargaining provisions of section 7A. Agreement among the parties was finally reached only after the NRA threatened that it would impose a code. The code did not establish price stabilization, nor did it resolve questions of industrial self-government versus governmental supervision or of centralization versus local autonomy, but it made dramatic changes in abolishing child labor, eliminating the compulsory scrip wages and company store, and establishing fair trade practices.

40|$|How much changed {{regarding}} the wage employment relationship in Britain between 1979 and 1994, {{as the government}} tried to encourage greater wage and employment flexibility? This paper uses <b>settlement</b> group <b>wage</b> contact data to track the evolution of nominal <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> over time and examines the impact that inflation has on these outcomes. We show that dissegregated wage determination {{is consistent with a}} continuing disdain for nominal wage cuts {{on the part of both}} employees and employers. Paradoxically, price inflation, rather than institutional reform of the labour market may have done more to pormote real wage adjustment across establishments in Britain. During periods of high inflation, the distribution of manufacturing real <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> shifts to the left, resulting in an increase in the number if settlement groups who experience real wage cuts. High levels of inflation appear to be associated with lower real wage increases for a given shock. The correlation between real wages and subsequent employment adjustment appears to be very weak. ...|$|R

40|$|Along with house rents, wages have {{frequently}} {{been described as}} the "stickiest" prices in the economy, rarely adjusted more than once a year. Because of this stickiness (which arises from the transactions costs involved in changing wages), a distinction exists between the adjustment of wages and the size of that adjustment. This distinction has important implications for empirical investigations of the determinants of aggregate money wage changes because the equations fitted in these studies are almost invariably plagued with aggregation bias unless the non-synchronous pattern of <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> in different sectors of the economy is taken into account. This is a particularly relevant issue when evaluating the effectiveness of incomes policies since some policies have operated by postponing the implementation of new <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> (in which case they are directed towards the occurrence of the event) while other policies have taken the form of specifying a permissible ceiling on wage increases (in which case they are designed to affect the extent of occurrence of the event, but not its occurrence). One {{purpose of this paper is}} to reevaluate the effectiveness of incomes policies by making use of information from one industry both on the frequency of <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> and on the size of wage changes when a settlement takes place. Our empirical work leads us to conjecture whether the apparent "statistical significance" reported by researchers with respect to the performance of variables in models of aggregate wage changes reflects primarily the effects of these variables on the probability of wages being adjusted rather than the effects on the magnitude of wage changes conditional upon wages being adjusted. ...|$|R

It seems that the union effect of a reduction in wage dispersion in pay levels observed in earlier studies is repeated when we follow wage changes (settlements) over the medium term. Declining union presence seems therefore to account for some of the increase in longer-term wage dispersion over the sample period. The increase in aggregate <b>wage</b> <b>settlement</b> dispersion seems to have been accompanied by an increase in the permanent rather than transitory components of the variance and this stems mostly from the non-union sector.

In this context, permanent part-time work, like the earlier family wage, seems to offer the best achievable resolution of the conflicting time demands of work and family life, together with a measure of income security.

Proposals of the industrial employers to add specific opening clauses to industry agreements have routinely been rejected by the Swedish unions. In 2009, however, under pressure of sharply rising unemployment combined with the government’s refusal to raise the level of unemployment benefits, the metal workers union conceded a temporary two-years crisis agreement reminiscent of German-style opening clauses (Kjellberg 2012 : 63).

40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{changing}} social and industrial conditions under which sugar workers in Guyana have worked, and the responses of workers and unions to these changes since 1964. It makes extensive use of original trade union and employer archives, other public and private documentary evidence and interviews with workers and union and state officials. The narrative and analysis focuses on the experience of union rivalry and the impact of state interventions in <b>wage</b> <b>settlements.</b> The sugar industry has several different unions with differing political and ideological positions, and there have been numerous instances of union rivalry and workers' discontent over union representation. Inadequate wage offers have often led to disputes, involving antagonisms between workers and management but also between workers and their union. In practice the majority of <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> have resulted from the intervention of a Commission of Inquiry or Arbitration Tribunal. In the late 1970 s the state's imposition of wage levels provoked numerous struggles, often of national proportions, and led to legal challenges by workers and one of their unions which resulted in the restoration of collective bargaining. Such developments have had major implications for the national labour movement. The thesis considers each of these facets of worker and union experience, and thus develops an analysis of the relationships between union rivalry, workers' resistance and <b>wage</b> <b>settlements</b> in the context of highly politicised trade unionism. In particular it discusses the implications of trade union affiliation to the major political parties and shows the extent to which political affiliation helped to destroy the collective bargaining process. It argues that while trade unions are involved in political struggles, they ought not to be affiliated to political parties, since this is likely to compromise the independence of the labour movement and weakens the collective bargaining process. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of opening clauses in collective bargaining agreements may indicate {{a tendency to}} a higher decentralised <b>wage</b> <b>settlement.</b> Increasing competition on inter-national product markets {{is assumed to be}} one reason for wage-setting decentralisation, whereas theoretical explanations focus currently on the change of production structure and the impact of exogenous shocks. Incorporating stylised facts about exporting firms, new trade models suggest a different way of adjustment to increasing competition depending on a firm’s nature. While the most productive exporters expand into new markets, small, less productive non-exporters are threatened by import competition. Based on the model from Bernard et al. (2003), we apply the theoretical implications to explain why decentralisa-tion in bargaining may arise. We examine in a second step whether small, less productive, non-exporting firms paying low average wages, possess a higher propensity to use open-ing clauses than more productive, large exporters with a high wage level. Based on IAB Establishment Data covering the German Manufacturing, our results indicate that firms ex-porting to EMU countries – but not exporters in general – have a lower propensity of using opening clauses than non-exporters. However, inconsistent with theory, slight evidence suggests a rising propensity with increasing firm size and increasing wage level...|$|E
40|$|Assuming the {{eventual}} {{adoption of the}} Euro, the paper reviews the run-up and the medium run issues on the path towards the Euro. It shows that various policy options are possible, especially {{with respect to the}} exchange rate regime and management. It also shows the limits of monetary policy when fiscal and income policies are not consistent with monetary policy. In the run-up phase of accession, the main constraints come from the recommendation to target a conversion exchange rate, while major gains can be obtained from an increase in money demand and a fall in interest rates once market expectations converge towards the conversion. In the medium run preparation, a fixed exchange rate extracts a high price in terms of high real interest rates and losses of competitiveness, unless fiscal policy is tight and <b>wage</b> <b>settlement</b> are market-based or kept under control. Floating exchange rates do not necessarily solve these problems but enable monetary policy to regain some of the effectiveness that it loses under fixed exchange rates. Eventually, a sound fiscal and income policy opens the way to a scenario of accommodating monetary policy and convergence towards the Euro. A political reading of the Maastricht conditions suggests that early adoption of the Euro is unlikely to be supported by the incumbents. It would then only make sense as a way out of a crisis.

40|$|The Public Administration model here {{developed}} simulates PA wage dynamics on {{the basis}} of the last realized levels and a set of economic and normative hypotheses (expected inflation, wage settlements, etc.). The narrow model dimensions do not permit sub-national forecasts; local wage dynamics, not always checked by the central government, may however vary over time and influence the general public deficit, which is a government’s competence. The likely clash between centralized constraints and decentralized dynamics is doomed to grow as a consequence of fiscal federalism and public functions decentralization. Such features are especially relevant for the National Health Service (NHS), due to its intrinsic institutional complexity, the NHS labor costs relevance and the sub-national segmentation of the operational units (local health authorities, hospitals, etc.). The NHS labor cost higher increments correspond to the wage settlements (1990 - 91, 1996 - 97, etc.). It is however possible to observe a background dynamic pattern - more evident in the years with no <b>wage</b> <b>settlement</b> effects (e. g. 1992 - 95) - which arises from various sources: decentralized wage bargaining, personnel seniority and promotions, professional qualifications changes, etc. Such factors affect average wages in a locally differentiated way: they can only be identified by a disaggregated data analysis.
