5|$|The Battle of Shrewsbury {{sequence}} {{has been}} particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin and the Battle on the Ice sequence in Alexander Nevsky, both directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Kenneth Branagh's Henry V used Welles's Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff {{in a way that}} was more influenced by Chimes at Midnight than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of Chimes at Midnight starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that Chimes at Midnights use of <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> lenses, low-key lighting and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced My Own Private IdahoGus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh backs {{repeatedly}} {{exposed the}} three threequarter system {{used by the}} English, as once the Welsh backs broke through the pack there was little defensive-cover to prevent run away scores. With the score at 9–7 to England, Marshall extended the lead with his third try of the match. This gave England an 11–7 lead with only ten minutes remaining. The game swung again when Percy Phillips received ball quickly before passing to Gould. Gould broke through the English defence and scored, though again Bancroft missed the conversion. With further Welsh pressure, a penalty was awarded to Wales on the English 25-yard line, but at a <b>wide</b> <b>angle.</b> Accounts differ as to what happened; some say that Gould tried to place the ball for Bancroft, but failed on the frozen ground, another states that Bancroft defied his captain to take the penalty as a drop kick, while other accounts mention Bancroft and Gould arguing on the pitch before Bancroft's attempt. Regardless, Bancroft kicked the penalty, the first penalty to be scored in an international match. It was the final score {{of the game and}} Wales were victorious, 12–11.|$|E

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} the mechanical effects of pilocarpine on the trabecular-iris angle opening in eyes with narrow angles, compared with {{its effects on}} healthy control subjects with <b>wide</b> <b>angles.</b>  METHODS—A narrow angle was defined as 25 ° or less of trabecular-iris angle on ultrasound biomicroscopic examination. The change in anterior chamber depth (ACD), trabecular-iris angle (TIA), angle opening distance (AOD, distance between trabecular meshwork and iris) measured at 250  µm and 500  µm from the scleral spur (AOD 250 and AOD 500), and iris thickness was determined in 30  eyes of 30  patients (13  men and 17  women, between 63  and 82  years (mean 70. 4  years)) with narrow angles and in 30  sex and age matched control subjects with <b>wide</b> <b>angles</b> before and 1  hour after the instillation of 2 % pilocarpine hydrochloride by ultrasound biomicroscopy.  RESULTS—In all eyes with narrow angles, pilocarpine increased the TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; these changes increased significantly and linearly as the corresponding pretreatment values decreased (r =  0. 807, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 787, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 852, p =  0. 0001). Of 30  eyes with <b>wide</b> <b>angles,</b> 23  eyes whose ACD was 2670  µm and more showed {{a decrease in the}} TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; the changes in TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500 also significantly correlated with the corresponding pretreatment values (r =  0. 913, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 882, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 895, p =  0. 0001). Pilocarpine induced a smaller decrease in ACD in eyes with narrow angles than in those with <b>wide</b> <b>angles</b> (p =  0. 0001). There was a linear correlation between the increase in ACD change and the decrease in pretreatment ACD in eyes with narrow angles and those with <b>wide</b> <b>angles</b> (r =  0. 781, p =  0. 0003; r =  0. 798, p =  0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—The finding that pilocarpine increases angular width in patients with narrow angles indicates that this agent is useful for treating patients with narrow angles and angle closure glaucoma. The prediction of the pilocarpine induced change in the angle may assist ophthalmologists in treating such patients. ...|$|R
