2500|$|The {{name of the}} newfound {{club was}} chosen in its second meeting. Bilitis is the name given to a fictional lesbian {{contemporary}} of Sappho, by the French poet Pierre Louÿs in his 1894 work The Songs of Bilitis in which Bilitis lived on the Isle of Lesbos alongside Sappho. The name was chosen for its obscurity; even Martin and Lyon {{did not know what}} it meant. [...] "Daughters" [...] was meant to evoke association with other American social associations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution. Early DOB members felt they had to follow two contradictory approaches: trying to recruit interested potential members and being secretive. Martin and Lyon justified the name, writing later, [...] "If anyone asked us, we could always say <b>we</b> <b>belong</b> to a poetry club." [...] They also designed a pin to wear to be able to identify with others, chose club colors and voted on a motto [...] "Qui vive", French for [...] "on alert".

On our action now depends the question whether our children shall curse or bless us; whether we shall live in their memory as promoters of civil strife, with all its miserable consequences, or as joint architects of a happy, prosperous, and united state. Each of us looks back to a noble past. United, we may ensure to our descendants a not unworthy future. Disunited, we can hope for nothing but stagnation, misery and ruin.
