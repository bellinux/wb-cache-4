5|$|During the war, U.S. Navy F-4 Phantom squadrons {{participated in}} 84 combat tours with F-4Bs, F-4Js, and F-4Ns. The navy claimed 40 air-to-air {{victories}} {{at a cost}} of 73 Phantoms lost in combat (seven to enemy aircraft, 13 to SAMs, and 53 to AAA). An additional 54 Phantoms <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> mishaps.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Friedrich {{frequently}} sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums, reflecting his obsession with {{death and the}} afterlife; he even created designs {{for some of the}} funerary art in Dresden's cemeteries.

5|$|On 28 June 1952, the {{squadron}} {{was ordered to}} attack a convoy of Chinese vehicles. Overton, leading a group of 24 F-84s, directed attacks on the convoy despite taking intense anti-aircraft fire himself, and the aircraft destroyed 150 vehicles. Though the circumstances in the event <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> subsequent actions, Overton would later be decorated for this achievement.|$|E

5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit with}} his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the {{detailed}} results of his exploration <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded {{a grant from the}} Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, the Japanese Army {{conducted}} an air {{attack on the}} U.S. naval fleet at Okinawa as promised, but they failed to sink any ships. Around 115 aircraft—many of them kamikaze—attacked the U.S. ships throughout the day of 7 April. Kamikaze aircraft hit the aircraft carrier Hancock, battleship , and destroyer , causing moderate damage to Hancock and Maryland and heavy damage to Bennett. About 100 of the Japanese aircraft <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the attack.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Germans {{carried out}} 51 airship raids and 52 {{fixed-wing}} bomber raids on England, which together dropped 280 tons of bombs. The casualties amounted to 1,413 killed, and 3,409 wounded. The success of anti-air defence measures was limited; of the 397 aircraft {{that had taken}} part in raids, only 24 Gothas were shot down (though 37 more <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> accidents), despite an estimated rate of 14,540 anti-air rounds per aircraft. Anti-zeppelin defences were more successful, with 17 shot down and 21 lost in accidents.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} dragonfly populations across the world, {{for example in}} Japan. Over 60% of Japan's wetlands <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the 20th century, so its dragonflies now depend largely on rice fields, ponds, and creeks. Dragonflies feed on pest insects in rice, acting as a natural pest control. Dragonflies are steadily declining in Africa, and represent a conservation priority.|$|E

5|$|Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when {{a warning}} of an {{approaching}} Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that day for the Maldives with no aircraft on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from Hermes <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the sinking.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Australia {{purchased}} 12 Westland Sea King Mk 50s as the Royal Australian Navy's new ASW helicopter; the Sea Kings {{replaced the}} aircraft carrier 's complement of Westland Wessex HAS31 in the following year.

Between October 1975 to May 1979, four aircraft <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> accidents, the primary causes were the loss of oil from the main gearbox.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, about 430,000 job-months and $2.8billion {{dollars in}} wages <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> {{the first three}} months after the attacks.

The U.S. government provided $11.2billion in immediate assistance to the Government of New York City in September 2001, and $10.5billion in early 2002 for economic development and infrastructure needs.|$|E

5|$|Over the Type UBIs' {{first year}} of service, UB-4 and UB-13 were both lost, and UB-2 and UB-5 were {{transferred}} to the Baltic Flotilla. In March 1917, UB-6 ran aground in Dutch waters and was interned {{for the rest of}} the war, along with her crew. The four remaining Type UBIs in Flanders—UB-10, UB-12, UB-16, UB-17—were all converted to minelayers by 1918, having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines. All but UB-10 <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> 1918; UB-10, in poor repair and out of service, was scuttled in October 1918 when the Germans evacuated from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Su-25s {{launched}} a total of 139 guided missiles of all types against Mujahideen positions. On average, each aircraft performed 360 sorties a year, a total considerably higher than that of any other combat aircraft in Afghanistan. By the end of the war, nearly 50 Su-25s were deployed at Afghan airbases, carrying out a total of 60,000 sorties. Between the first deployment in 1981 {{and the end of the}} war in 1989, 21–23 aircraft <b>were</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> combat operations, with up to 9 destroyed on the ground while parked.|$|E
