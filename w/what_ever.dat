Millions of cubic feet of sandstone was excavated from Sydney's Cockatoo Island to create a dry dock on the island.|$|E

25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, {{no matter what it}} took, and constantly strove towards <b>what</b> <b>ever</b> goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier that was supposed to hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how hard she works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Chastain took on {{the part}} of a {{commander}} in Ridley Scott's science fiction film The Martian. Starring Matt Damon as a botanist who is stranded on Mars by a team of astronauts commanded by Chastain's character, the film was based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name. Chastain met with astronauts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johnson Space Center, and based her role on Tracy Caldwell Dyson, with whom she spent time in Houston. The Martian became her second film to earn over $600 million in two consecutive years. Also in 2015, Chastain played a countess who plots with her brother (played by Tom Hiddleston) to terrorize his new bride (played by Mia Wasikowska) in Guillermo del Toro's gothic romance Crimson Peak. Chastain approached the villainous part with empathy, and in preparation read graveyard poetry and watched the films Rebecca (1940) and <b>What</b> <b>Ever</b> Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). Del Toro cast her in the film to lend accessibility to a part he considered [...] "psychopathic", but critic Peter Debruge of Variety found her [...] "alarmingly miscast" [...] and criticized her for failing to effectively convey her character's insecurity and ruthlessness. Conversely, David Sims of Slate magazine praised her for portraying her character's [...] "jealous intensity to the hilt".|$|E
