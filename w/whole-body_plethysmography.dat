We investigated the respiratory function of conscious Mecp 2 (-/y) mice at P 40 -P 60 using conventional <b>whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography,</b> double-chamber plethysmography and chest EMG recordings. Double-chamber plethysmography revealed a persistent increase in respiratory work-load with enlarged chest movements, but no subsequent increase of tidal volume thus revealing a mismatch between airflow and muscle work-load. Apnoeas occurred with cessation of both chest movements and ventilation, but some (40 %) developed with persisting rhythmic chest EMG discharges or chest movements without respiratory airflow, suggesting respiratory efforts against obstructed airways. Airway obstruction was maintained even when the respiratory drive increased significantly, triggering large chest EMG discharges and movements. <b>Whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> of Mecp 2 (-/y) mice revealed significant increases of spirograms, reflecting forced chest movements against partially obstructed airways.

40|$|Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating {{polypeptide}} (PACAP) -deficient mice {{are more}} prone to sudden death during postnatal weeks 1 – 3 than wild-type littermates. Given that PACAP is localized in brainstem regions associated with respiratory chemosensitivity, we examined whether PACAP-null neonates have reduced respiratory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Using unrestrained, <b>whole-body,</b> flow-through <b>plethysmography</b> we found that, by postnatal day 4, the PACAP-null neonates had significantly reduced ventilation during baseline breathing, and blunted responses to both hypoxia (10 % O 2 – 90 % N 2) and hypercapnia (8 % CO 2 – 92 % air). To determine whether the respiratory phenotype of the PACAP-null mice may contribute to their greater neonatal mortality, we used ECG to examine respiration and cardiovascular function of littermates. We demonstrate that, under conditions that exacerbate mortality of knockout but not wild-type animals, PACAP-deficient mice experience prolonged apnoeas that precede atrio-ventricular block. Both apnoeas and atrio-ventricular block were absent in wild-type littermates. These data suggest that PACAP-deficiency results in higher neonatal mortality primarily as a result of respiratory control defects and raise the possibility that mutations in genes encoding components of the PACAP signalling pathways may contribute to neonatal breathing disorders in humans...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings:Mice were sensitized intraperitoneally (i. p.) to ovalbumin (OVA) with or without alum, and challenged intranasally with OVA.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interplay of}} {{environmental}} and genetic factors {{may lead to a}} spectrum of physiological and behavioral outcomes. How environmental stress factors interact with the diverse mouse genomes is still poorly understood and elucidating the underlying interactions requires specific stress models that can target integrated physiological systems. Here, we employ behavioral tests and <b>whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> {{to examine the effects of}} 12 weeks of simulated high altitude (HA) exposure on two inbred mouse strains, BALBc and C 57 Bl 6. We find that HA induced- weight loss recovers at significantly different rates in these two strains. Even at 12 weeks, however, both strains fail to reach body weight levels of controls. Performance on two motor tasks, rotarod and treadmill, improve with HA exposure but more prominently in BALBc mice. <b>Whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> outcomes indicate that compensation to chronic HA includes increased respiratory frequencies and tidal volumes in both strains. However, the effects on tidal volume are significantly greater in BALBc mice and showed a biphasic course. Whole- body metabolic rates are also increased in both strains with prolonged HA exposure, but were more pronounced in BALBc mice suggestive of less successful adaptation in this strain. These adaptations occur in the absence of gross pathological changes in all major organs. Together these results indicate that chronic HA exposure results in environmental stressors that impact the specific physiological responses of BALBc more than C 57 Bl 6 mice. Thus, these strains provide a promising platform for investigating how genetic backgrounds can differentially reinforce the effects of long-lasting environmental stressors and their potential to interact with psychological stressors...|$|E

40|$|Brachycephalic obstructive airway {{syndrome}} (BOAS) is {{an important}} health and welfare problem in several popular dog breeds. <b>Whole-body</b> barometric <b>plethysmography</b> (WBBP) is a non-invasive method that allows safe and repeated quantitative measurements of respiratory cycles on unsedated dogs. Here respiratory flow traces in French bulldogs from the pet population were characterised using WBBP, and a computational application was developed to recognise affected animals. Eighty-nine French bulldogs and twenty non-brachycephalic controls underwent WBBP testing. A respiratory functional grading system was used on each dog based on respiratory signs (i. e. respiratory noise, effort, etc.) before and after exercise. For development of an objective BOAS classifier, functional Grades 0 and I were considered to have insignificant clinical signs (termed here BOAS-) and Grades II and III to have significant signs (termed here BOAS+). A comparison between owner-perception of BOAS and functional grading revealed that 60 % of owners failed to recognise BOAS in dogs that graded BOAS+ in this study. WBBP flow traces {{were found to be}} significantly different between non-brachycephalic controls and Grade 0 French bulldogs; BOAS- and BOAS+ French bulldogs. A classifier was developed using quadratic discriminant analysis of the respiratory parameters to distinguish BOAS- and BOAS + French bulldogs, and a BOAS Index was calculated for each dog. A cut-off value of the BOAS Index was selected based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the classifier on the training group (n= 69) were 0. 97, 0. 93, 0. 95, and 0. 97, respectively. The classifier was validated using a test group of French bulldogs (n= 20) with an accuracy of 0. 95. WBBP offers objective screening for the diagnosis of BOAS in French Bulldogs.

In this study, conformational risk factors for BOAS that could potentially aid in breeding away from BOAS were sought. Six hundred and four pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs were included in the study. Soft tape measurements of the head and body were used and the inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated. Breed-specific models were developed to assess the associations between the conformational factors and BOAS status based on functional grading. The models were further validated by means of a BOAS index, which is an objective measurement of respiratory function using <b>whole-body</b> barometric <b>plethysmography.</b> The final models have good predictive power for discriminating BOAS (-) and BOAS (+) phenotypes indicated by the area under the curve values of > 80 % on the receiver operating curves. When other factors were controlled, stenotic nostrils were associated with BOAS in all three breeds; pugs and bulldogs with higher body condition scores (BCS) had a higher risk of developing BOAS. Among the standardized conformational measurements (i. e. craniofacial ratio (CFR), eye width ratio (EWR), skull index (SI), neck girth ratio (NGR), and neck length ratio (NLR)), for pugs EWR and SI, for French bulldogs NGR and NLR, and for bulldogs SI and NGR showed significant associations with BOAS status. However, the NGR in bulldogs was the only significant predictor that also had satisfactory inter-observer reproducibility.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Client-owned pugs, French bulldogs, and bulldogs (n[*]=[*] 50). METHODS: Noninvasive <b>whole-body</b> barometric <b>plethysmography</b> (WBBP) {{was used to assess}} respiratory function before, 1 month and 6 months after upper airway corrective surgery. Postoperatively, BOAS indices (ie, ascending severity score generated from WBBP data, 0 %- 100 %) that equaled to or exceeded the cut-off values of BOAS in the diagnostic models were considered to have a "poor prognosis. " A multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors for prognosis. RESULTS: The median BOAS indices decreased after surgery (from 76 % to 63 %, P[*]<[*]. 0001), although dogs with indices in this range would still be considered clinically affected. Age (odds ratios [OR][*]=[*] 0. 96, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 93 - 0. 99, P[*]<[*]. 05), body condition (OR[*]=[*] 0. 06, 95 % CI: 0. 01 - 0. 39, P[*]<[*]. 01), laryngeal collapse (OR[*]=[*] 6. 1, 95 % CI: 1 - 37. 22, P[*]<[*]. 05), and surgical techniques (OR[*]=[*] 7. 94, 95 % CI: 1. 17 - 54. 01, P[*]<[*]. 05) were associated with postoperative prognosis. The multivariate model suggests modified multilevel surgery (MMS) may have a better outcome than traditional multilevel surgery (TMS) (P[*]=[*]. 034). The positive predictive value of the logistic model was 84 % (95 % CI: 68 - 94 %) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 89 % (95 % CI: 78 - 99 %, P <. 0001).

40|$|Background/Purpose: House {{dust mite}} (HDM) {{is well known}} as one of the major indoor allergens that trigger {{allergic}} inflammation, especially asthma, and accounts for 85 % of all cases. So far, asthma has been thought of as a condition of imbalance between T helper (Th) 1 and Th 2. Fungal immunomodulatory protein-Flammulina velutipes (FIP-fve) has been seemingly demonstrated to modulate the response to Th 1 cytokine production. The aim of this study was to investigate if the oral administration of FIP-fve can inhibit HDM-induced asthma inflammation in the mouse model. Methods: We divided the mice (female BALB/c, 4 – 6 weeks) into four groups: the prevention group, which consisted of mice sensitized by HDM (intraperitoneally on Day 1, Day 7, and Day 14, and intranasally on Day 14, Day 17, Day 21, Day 24, and Day 27) fed with FIP-fve from Day 1 to Day 14; the treatment group, which comprised mice that received treatment from Day 14 to Day 28; the positive control (PC, sensitized by HDM fed without FIP-fve) group; and the negative control group (NC, nonsensitized). Airway hyperresponsiveness induced by methacholine challenge was determined using <b>whole-body</b> barometric <b>plethysmography.</b> In addition, cytokines were analyzed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum.

Results: The results showed that both pre- and posttreated FIP-fve groups had significantly reduced airway hyperresponsiveness compared with the PC group after methacholine challenge. In addition, a significantly decreased level of HDM-specific immunoglobulin E in serum and decreased production of Th 2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were observed in these two FIP-fve fed groups. Moreover, more decreased amounts of infiltrating inflammatory cells were present in the lungs of FIP-fve fed groups than those of the PC group.

The effects of metformin, an antidiabetic agent that improves insulin sensitivity, on endothelial function have not been reported. METHODSSubjects with diet-treated type 2 diabetes but without the confounding collection of cardiovascular risk factors seen in the metabolic syndrome were treated with metformin 500 mg twice daily (n = 29) or placebo (n = 15) for 12 weeks. Before and after treatment, blood flow responses to intraarterial administration of endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine), endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) and nitrate-independent (verapamil) vasodilators were measured using forearm <b>plethysmography.</b> <b>Whole-body</b> insulin resistance was assessed on both occasions using the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR). RESULTSSubjects who received metformin demonstrated statistically significant improvement in acetylcholine-stimulated flows compared with those treated with placebo (p = 0. 0027 by 2 -way analysis of variance), whereas no significant effect was seen on nitroprusside-stimulated (p = 0. 27) or verapamil-stimulated (p = 0. 40) flows. There was a significant improvement in insulin resistance with metformin (32. 5 % reduction in HOMA-IR, p = 0. 01), and by stepwise multivariate analysis insulin resistance was the sole predictor of endothelium-dependent blood flow following treatment (r = − 0. 659, p = 0. 0012). CONCLUSIONSMetformin treatment improved both insulin resistance and endothelial function, with a strong statistical link between these variables. This supports the concept of the central role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This has important implications for the investigation and treatment of vascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the control of breathing. Baseline breathing at rest and ventilatory responses to brief exposures to hypoxia (10 % O(2)) and hypercapnia (3 % and 5 % CO(2)), measured by <b>whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> in partially restrained animals, were compared in mice lacking either M(1) and M(3) or M(2) and M(4) muscarinic receptors, and in wild-type matched controls. M(1 / 3) R double-knockout mice showed at rest an elevated ventilation (V (E)) due to a large (57 %) increase in tidal volume (V(T)). Chemosensory ventilatory responses were unaltered. M(2 / 4) R double-knockout mice were agitated and showed elevated V (E) and breathing frequency (f(R)) at rest when partially restrained, but unaltered V (E) and low f(R) when recorded unrestrained. Chemosensory ventilatory responses were unaltered. The results suggest that M(1) and M(3) receptors {{are involved in the}} control of tidal volume, while M(2) and M(4) receptors may be involved in the control of breathing frequency at rest and response to stress...|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) acting through muscarinic receptors {{is thought}} to be {{involved}} in the control of breathing, notably in central and peripheral chemosensory afferents and in regulations related to sleep-wake states. By using <b>whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography,</b> we compared baseline breathing at rest and ventilatory responses to acute exposure (5 min) to moderate hypoxia (10 % O(2)) and hypercapnia (3 and 5 % CO(2)) in mice lacking either the M(1) or the M(3) muscarinic receptor, and in wild-type matched controls. M(1) knockout mice showed normal minute ventilation (V(E)) but elevated tidal volume (V(T)) at rest, and normal chemosensory ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. M(3) knockout mice had elevated V(E) and V(T) at rest, a reduced V(T) response slope to hypercapnia, and blunted V(E) and frequency responses to hypoxia. The results suggest that M(1) and M(3) muscarinic receptors play significant roles in the regulation of tidal volume at rest and that the afferent pathway originating from peripheral chemoreceptors involves M(3) receptors...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} a permanent excess of acetylcholine (AChE) on respiration, breathing and chemosensitivity were analyzed from birth to adulthood in mice lacking the AChE gene (AChE-/-), in heterozygotes, and in control wild-type (AChE+/+) littermates. Breathing at rest and ventilatory responses to brief exposures to hypoxia (10 % O 2) and hypercapnia (3 - 5 % CO 2) were measured by <b>whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography.</b> At rest AChE-/- mice show larger tidal volumes (VT, + 96 % in adults), overall ventilation (VE, + 70 %), and mean inspiratory flow (+ 270 %) than wild-type mice, with no change in breathing frequency (fR). AChE-/- mice have a slightly blunted response to hypoxia, but increased VE and fR responses to hypercapnia. Heterozygous animals present no consistent alterations of breathing at rest and chemosensitivity is normal. Adult AChE-/- mice have an increased VE/VO 2 and a marginally higher normalized VO 2. The results suggest that the hyperventilation and altered chemosensitivity in AChE-/- mice largely reflect alterations of central respiratory control...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that obesity is {{associated}} with increased blood concentrations of proinflammatory factors and markers of endothelial dysfunction such as fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and von Willebrand factor (vWF). We analyzed the association of these markers with percentage of body fat (BF), and the influence of leptin in a cross-sectional study of 1, 089 subjects (366 men) aged 44 (34 - 53) [median (interquartile range) ] years, who were classified as obese or nonobese according to BF estimated by <b>whole-body</b> air displacement <b>plethysmography.</b> Obesity was defined as BF >or= 25 % in men and >or= 35 % in women. Compared with non-obese subjects (mean +/- SD), obese patients had higher concentrations of fibrinogen (312 +/- 78 vs. 342 +/- 81 mg/dl, P < 0. 001), CRP (0. 41 +/- 0. 75 vs. 0. 75 +/- 1. 04 mg/l, P = 0. 014), vWF (107 +/- 29 vs. 123 +/- 55 %, P < 0. 001), and leptin (10. 4 +/- 6. 5 vs. 37. 5 +/- 26. 1 ng/ml, P < 0. 0001). A positive correlation was observed between BF and fibrinogen (r = 0. 266; P < 0. 0001), logCRP (r = 0. 409; P < 0. 0001), and vWF (r = 206; P < 0. 0001). Leptin was correlated with fibrinogen (r = 0. 219, P < 0. 0001), logCRP (r = 0., P < 0. 0001), and vWF (r = 0. 124, P = 0. 002), but the statistical significance was lost after including BF in adjusted-correlation and multivariate analysis, suggesting that they are not regulated by leptin per se. In conclusion, the obesity-associated increase in the circulating concentrations of fibrinogen, CRP, and vWF is highly associated to BF and apparently not determined by lepti...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recent {{epidemiologic}} {{studies have}} shown that obesity is associated with elevated blood concentrations of prothrombotic-proinflammatory factors and markers of endothelial dysfunction such as fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and homocysteine. We have assessed whether these markers are associated with percentage of body fat (BF), insulin sensitivity as well as with leptin concentrations. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-five men aged 49. 6 +/- 12. 7 yr (mean +/- SD) underwent <b>whole-body</b> air displacement <b>plethysmography</b> (Bod-Pod(R)) for estimating BF. Blood analyses for leptin and several other metabolic and cardiovascular markers were carried out. RESULTS: Obese subjects had higher levels as compared to controls of BF (37. 5 +/- 5. 1 vs. 26. 0 +/- 6. 6, p < 0. 01), fibrinogen (3. 30 +/- 0. 43 vs. 2. 67 +/- 0. 11, p < 0. 01), vWF (136. 4 +/- 50. 4 % vs. 81. 6 +/- 12. 6 %, p < 0. 05), and leptin (17. 6 +/- 8. 7 vs. 6. 2 +/- 3. 3, p < 0. 01), lower concentrations of HDL-cholesterol (1. 09 +/- 0. 20 vs. 1. 51 +/- 0. 10, p < 0. 001) and lower QUICKI (1 /[log(Ins(0)) + log(Glu(0)) ]) (0. 31 +/- 0. 03 vs. 0. 34 +/- 0. 02, p < 0. 05). No significant changes were observed in CRP (5. 7 +/- 3. 4 vs. 3. 8 +/- 1. 6, p = 0. 327) and homocysteine (9. 4 +/- 4. 2 vs. 8. 3 +/- 0. 9, p = 0. 749). A positive correlation was observed between BF and fibrinogen (r = 0. 67, p = 0. 0003). Plasma leptin concentrations were correlated with fibrinogen (r = 0. 71, p = 0. 0001) and CRP (r = 0. 43, p = 0. 044). After adjustment for BF leptin emerged as a significant predictor of fibrinogen (beta = 0. 47, p = 0. 023; R(2) = 0. 59, p < 0. 001). QUICKI was positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol (r = 0. 59, p = 0. 010) and negatively with fibrinogen (r = - 0. 53, p = 0. 025), CRP (r = - 0. 52, p = 0. 028) and vWF (r = - 0. 56, p = 0. 013). CONCLUSIONS: Increased BF and impaired insulin sensitivity are associated with increased concentrations of cardiovascular risk factors. Leptin seems to be involved in this elevation and emerges as a predictor of circulating fibrinogen concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{patterns}} {{represent a}} promising physiological index for assessing emotional states in preclinical studies. Since disturbed emotional regulation {{may lead to}} forms of excessive aggressiveness, {{in this study we}} investigated the hypothesis that rats that differ largely in their level of aggressive behavior display matching alterations in respiration. Respiration was recorded in male high-aggressive (HA, n = 8) and non-aggressive (NA, n = 8) Wild-type Groningen rats using <b>whole-body</b> <b>plethysmography.</b> Subsequently, anxiety-related behaviors were evaluated in the elevated plus maze and social avoidance–approach tests. During respiratory testing, HA rats showed elevated basal respiratory rate, reduced sniffing, exaggerated tachypnoeic response to an acoustic stimulus and a larger incidence of sighs. In addition, HA rats spent less time in the open arms of the plus maze and displayed higher levels of social avoidance behavior compared to NA rats. These findings indicate that HA rats are characterized by alterations in respiratory functioning and behavior that are overall indicative of an anxiety-like phenotype...|$|E
