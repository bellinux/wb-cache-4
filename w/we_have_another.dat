25|$|When {{a vacancy}} occurred, {{the bishop of}} the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of {{election}} was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to Rome. It was necessary that an abbot {{should be at least}} 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached {{on the rights of the}} monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8–12 years.|$|E

[...] From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> thought, another thought, another thought. Even when you are asleep you are having dreams, so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn't always active with thoughts. But you can turn off your mind, {{and go to the}} part which Maharishi described as: [...] "Where was your last thought before you thought it?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Leicester Chronicle {{suspected}} that [...] "it {{will be a}} long time, perhaps, before <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> match so keenly contested". The visitors scored early on, but Small Heath's shoot-on-sight policy produced goals for Hands, after a clash with Mobley left Preston goalkeeper James Trainer on the floor, and for Wheldon, before Edward Brueton, deputising in goal for the injured Partridge, let in a soft goal just before half-time. The second half brought [...] "more finesse and less vigour" [...] from the home side, but Preston grew stronger, took the lead, and Small Heath [...] "appeared to be done with". Then Trainer could only turn Mobley's lob in off the post, the same player gave his side the lead, but [...] "before the Small Heath contingent had finished congratulating one another", [...] "North End charging down the field finely from the centre kick scored again before the whistle sounded" [...] to make the final score 4–4. Match receipts totalled nearly £250, a ground record.|$|E

2500|$|One of the originators of the World Social Forum, Oded Grajew, of the Ethos Institute for Business and Social Responsibility, {{said in an}} {{interview}} with InMotion Magazine in 2004, [...] "Then I had the idea. Why not create the World Social Forum, as we have the World Economic Forum, speaking about the people in the world? Why not have the World Social Forum -- the social is more important than the economic -- to have a space to show that we can have an alternative? We have choice. This is not the only way you can see the world, globalization. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> way to see it. And, at the same time, force people to look, to make a choice. What is your choice? What is your vision of the world?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mystery of the Sea has two {{important}} layers of historical context: the Spanish–American War, and the sixteenth-century interactions between England and Spain. The first event is contemporaneous with {{the events of}} the novel and Stoker's lifetime, while the second provides a backdrop and historical frame within the novel. The sixteenth-century and nineteenth-century events are closely intertwined in the novel, and both {{play a role in the}} politics of the story as well as character and plot development. A review in The Athenaeum from Stoker's time recognizes these historical resonances from a surprisingly close perspective. This reviewer notes that [...] "because the charming heroine is American, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> 'mystery.' It is the time of the Spanish–American War, and naturally a Spanish grandee is brought upon the scene". The reviewer also pinpoints the [...] "recent controversy that suggests the Baconian Bilateral Cipher as the means of finding the Papal hoard".|$|E
2500|$|On September 2, Gun Runner {{made his}} next {{start in the}} Woodward Stakes at Saratoga, going off as the {{prohibitive}} favorite {{in a field of}} five. Trainer Todd Pletcher entered two horses, with Neolithic assigned to set a fast early pace in the hopes of tiring Gun Runner, while Rally Cry was intended to close from behind. The race went much as expected, with Gun Runner stalking Neolithic for the first 6 furlongs before swinging to the lead on the far turn. Gun Runner maintained his momentum and eventually won by [...] lengths over the late-closing Rally Cry. His time of 1:47.43 was the fastest Woodward Stakes since the race was moved to Saratoga in 2006 and earned Gun Runner a career high Beyer Speed Figure of 115. He was also given a Timeform US rating of 142, the highest Timeform US rating ever achieved. [...] "That was better than the Whitney, just stronger, faster overall," [...] said Geroux. [...] "I don't think he's 100-percent cranked up yet. I really do think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> step forward with him. We're going to need one against Arrogate." ...|$|E
