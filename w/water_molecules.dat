5|$|In aqueous solution, the {{alkali metal}} ions form aqua ions of the formula +, where n is the {{solvation}} number. Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> directly {{attached to the}} metal ion are said {{to belong to the}} first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond, with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other <b>water</b> <b>molecules.</b> The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li+ has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral +: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 {{may be the result of}} the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> that approach + through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion, forming the octahedral + ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the + and + ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate + ion.|$|E

5|$|A {{snowflake}} {{consists of}} roughly 1019 <b>water</b> <b>molecules,</b> which {{are added to}} its core at different rates and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through {{on its way to}} the ground.

5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about {{for no apparent}} reason. In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that this Brownian motion {{was caused by the}} <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shutter-speed model {{analysis}} of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging allows estimation of mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime (a measure of cellular energy metabolism) and volume transfer constant (a measure of hemodynamics). The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the prognostic utility of pretreatment mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime and volume transfer constant in predicting overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to stratify p 16 -positive patients based upon survival outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 60 patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging before treatment. Median, mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime and volume transfer constant values from metastatic nodes were computed from each patient. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to associate mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime and volume transfer constant and their combination with overall survival for the first 2 years, 5 years, and beyond (median duration, > 7 years). RESULTS: By the last date of observation, 18 patients had died, and median follow-up for surviving patients (n = 42) was 8. 32 years. Patients with high mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 01) prolonged overall survival by 5 years compared with those with low mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime (13 deaths). Similarly, patients with high mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 006) longer overall survival at long-term duration than those with low mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime (14 deaths). However, volume transfer constant was a significant predictor for only the 5 -year follow-up period. There was some evidence (P <. 10) to suggest that mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime and volume transfer constant were associated with overall survival for the first 2 years. Patients with high mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime and high volume transfer constant were associated with significantly (P <. 01) longer overall survival compared with other groups for all follow-up periods. In addition, p 16 -positive patients with high mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime and high volume transfer constant demonstrated a trend toward the longest overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: A combined {{analysis of}} mean intracellular <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> lifetime and volume transfer constant provided the best model to predict overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck...|$|R

50|$|The law of {{constant}} composition says that, {{in any particular}} chemical compound, all samples of that compound will {{be made up of}} the same elements in the same proportion or ratio. For example, any <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> is always made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in a 2:1 ratio. If we look at the relative masses of oxygen and hydrogen in a <b>water</b> <b>molecule,</b> we see that 94% of the mass of a <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> is accounted for by oxygen and the remaining 6% is the mass of hydrogen. This mass proportion will be the same for any <b>water</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|R

5|$|Thulium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tm and atomic number 69. It is the thirteenth and third-last {{element in the}} lanthanide series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine <b>water</b> <b>molecules.</b>|$|E

In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine <b>water</b> <b>molecules.</b> Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides.|$|E

50|$|The joining {{of simple}} sugars into a double sugar happens by a {{condensation}} reaction, which involves {{the elimination of}} a <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> from the functional groups only. Breaking apart a double sugar into its two simple sugars is accomplished by hydrolysis {{with the help of}} a type of enzyme called a disaccharidase. As building the larger sugar ejects a <b>water</b> <b>molecule,</b> breaking it down consumes a <b>water</b> <b>molecule.</b> These reactions are vital in metabolism. Each disaccharide is broken down {{with the help of a}} corresponding disaccharidase (sucrase, lactase, and maltase).|$|R
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of <b>water</b> <b>molecules,</b> with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of the}} reaction with water. <b>Water</b> <b>molecules</b> ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar <b>water</b> <b>molecules.</b> Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
50|$|The concept can be {{expanded}} to a tri-atomic <b>molecule</b> such as <b>water</b> where we have two O-H bonds and H-O-H bond angle as variables on which the potential energy of a <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> will depend. We can safely assume the two O-H bonds to be equal. Thus, a PES can be drawn mapping the potential energy E of a <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> {{as a function of}} two geometric parameters, q1= O-H bond length and q2=H-O-H bond angle. The lowest point on such a PES will define the equilibrium structure of a <b>water</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractActivation of the <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> {{involved}} in GTP hydrolysis within the HRas⋅RasGAP system is analyzed using a tailored approach based on hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulation. A new path emerges: transfer of a proton from the attacking <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> {{to a second}} <b>water</b> <b>molecule,</b> then a different proton is transferred from this second <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> to the GTP. Gln 61 will stabilize the transient OH− and H 3 O+ molecules thus generated.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for MMP-3 is {{a variation on}} a larger theme seen in all matrix metalloproteinases. In the active site, a <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> is coordinated to a glutamate residue (Glu202) {{and one of the}} zinc ions present in the catalytic domain. First, the coordinated <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide substrate's scissile carbon while the glutamate simultaneously abstracts a proton from the <b>water</b> <b>molecule.</b> The abstracted proton is then removed from the glutamate by the nitrogen of the scissile amide. This forms a tetrahedral gem-diolate intermediate that is coordinated to the zinc atom. In order for the amide product to be released from the active site, the scissile amide must abstract a second proton from the coordinated <b>water</b> <b>molecule.</b> Alternatively, it has been shown for thermolysin (another metalloproteinase) that the amide product can be released in its neutral (R-NH2) form. The carboxylate product is released after a <b>water</b> <b>molecule</b> attacks the zinc ion and displaces the carboxylate product. The release of the carboxylate product is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction.|$|R
5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} {{have low}} solubility in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have {{a higher rate of}} diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two <b>water</b> <b>molecules</b> to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E
