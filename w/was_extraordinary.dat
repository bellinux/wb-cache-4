5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of Thespis <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> for the theatre.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, the Progressive League {{was plagued}} by {{internal}} conflict between Progressives (former Moderate Conservatives) and Historicals (former Liberals). All of the cabinets formed by the League after 1862 were short-lived. The Paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected, increasing tensions within the party. By 1868, a rift had opened between the Marquis of Caxias (then Commander-in-Chief of Brazilian forces in the war) and the Progressive Cabinet. With its credibility for prosecuting the war now vanished, the Cabinet resigned and the Emperor called the Conservatives back into power on 16 July 1868. Once again Paranhos—who <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> member of the Council of State since 18 August 1866—became Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, two {{physicians}} {{based in}} Saint Petersburg, the leading Russian neurologist Vladimir Bekhterev {{and his younger}} Estonian colleague, the neurosurgeon Ludvig Puusepp, published a paper reviewing a range of surgical interventions that had been performed on the mentally ill. While generally treating these endeavours favourably, in their consideration of psychosurgery they reserved unremitting scorn for Burckhardt's surgical experiments of 1888 and opined that it <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> that a trained medical doctor could undertake such an unsound procedure.|$|E

Wang Lang felt that Yu Jin <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and had the potential to become a great general, so he recommended Yu to Cao Cao. Cao Cao commissioned Yu Jin as a Major (司馬) after interviewing him, and then sent him to attack Guangwei (廣威), a location in Xu Province, which was governed by Tao Qian.

25|$|Guo Jia {{was from}} Yangzhai County (陽翟縣), Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), {{which is in}} present-day Yuzhou, Henan. As a youth, he was famous for his {{intelligence}} and foresight. Since reaching adulthood at around the age of 19, Guo Jia had been travelling {{around the country and}} befriending members of the scholar-gentry and other talented persons. He did not associate himself with the hoi polloi and was thus not very well known outside of his circles.

During the Zhengshi era (240–249) of the reign of Cao Fang, he served as a Gentleman Cadet of the Imperial Library (秘書郎) and was later promoted to Attendant Gentleman of the Palace Writers and Masters of Writing (尚書中書侍郎). He was awarded the title of a Secondary Marquis (爵關內) when Cao Mao ascended the throne in 254.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 16th Century, the {{prestige}} of the Society of Jesus <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> all over Europe, and the Capitanía General of Guatemala requested a group of Jesuits on August 9, 1561. The first petition was denied by King Felipe II as he needed the order member to remain in Spain to lead the Counter Reform efforts. Five years later, however, Felipe II himself asked for twenty four Jesuit priest to be sent to the Americas, but due to several issues this could not be done. In 1580, on his way back from a visit to Peruvian schools, Master Priest Juan de la Plaza stopped by Guatemala and make several petitions to the criollo City Hall such that by 1607 the first Jesuits arrived to Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemala.|$|E

25|$|Using this equipment, Cavendish {{calculated}} the attraction between the balls {{from the period}} of oscillation of the torsion balance, and then he used this value to calculate {{the density of the}} Earth. Cavendish found that the Earth's average density is 5.48 times greater than that of water. John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5.448, and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper. What <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> about Cavendish’s experiment was its elimination of every source of error and every factor that could disturb the experiment and its precision in measuring an astonishingly small attraction, a mere 1/50,000,000 of the weight of the lead balls. The result that Cavendish obtained for the density of the Earth is within 1 percent of the currently accepted figure.|$|E
25|$|In a U.S. court filing on February 11, 2010, Nortel {{proposed}} to spend $92.3M on retention bonuses for 1,475 employees in its Nortel Business Services and Corporate groups. According to the plan, Christopher Ricaurte, president of Nortel Business Services, would receive $2.5 million in incentives. In all, Canadian employees {{were eligible for}} $27 million, U.S. employees $55 million, and about $10 million would go to others. This proposed plan came the same week Nortel negotiated a $57-million deal to wind up health care and other benefits for former Canadian employees. Claiming that the retention bonuses proposal <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary,</b> acting US trustee Roberta DeAngelis objected to the payment of $55.6 million to 866 employees.

25|$|Lady Pan {{was from}} Juzhang County (句章縣; within present-day Ningbo) in Kuaiji Commandery. Her father, {{who served as}} a low-ranking official, was {{executed}} for committing an offence whose details are not recorded. Both Lady Pan and her elder sister ended up as workers in a textile factory. Once, Sun Quan encountered her and felt that she <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> so he took her as his concubine. In 243, while she was pregnant, she dreamt of receiving a dragon head and gave birth to Sun Liang later. In 250, {{in the aftermath of a}} succession struggle between Sun Quan's sons Sun He and Sun Ba, Sun Liang was designated as the crown prince by his father. In the same year, Lady Pan requested Sun Quan to arrange a marriage for her elder sister and he agreed. In 251, Sun Quan instated Lady Pan as the empress. Empress Pan was known for charming but jealous as she never ceased slandering and harming Sun Quan's other wives until her death.|$|E

25|$|As a general, Chares {{has been}} charged with rashness, {{especially}} in the needless exposure of his own person; this said he appears to have been, during the greater portion of his career, the best commander that Athens had. In politics, we see him connected throughout with Demosthenes. Morally he must have been an incubus on any party to which he attached himself, notwithstanding the assistance he might sometimes render it through the orators whom he is said to have kept constantly in pay. His alleged profligacy, which was measureless, he unblushingly avowed and gloried in, openly ridiculing the austere Phocion. His bad faith passed into a proverb; and his rapacity <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary,</b> even amidst the system then prevailing, when the citizens of Athens would neither fight their own battles nor pay the men who fought them, and her commanders had to support their mercenaries as best they could. His triumphal career under the banners of the republic may be seen as a symptom of the decline of Athens' values and power.|$|E
25|$|These {{policies}} and preoccupations culminated in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. This divided the empire into Western and Eastern administrative blocs: each had its Augustus (senior emperor), {{helped by a}} Caesar (junior emperor) as Augustus-in-waiting. Provinces were divided and subdivided: their imperial bureaucracy <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> in size, scope and attention to detail but their senior Augustus was fundamentally conservative. On his accession in 284 AD, he held games in honour of the divus Antinous. Where his predecessors preferred persuasion and coercion of recalcitrant sects, Diocletian launched a series of ferocious reactions known in Church history as the Great Persecution. According to Lactantius, this began with a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian's domus and a subsequent (but undated) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military. A date of 302 is regarded as likely and Eusebius also says the persecutions of Christians began in the army. However Maximilian's martyrdom (295) came from his refusal of military service, and Marcellus' (298) for renouncing his military oath. Legally, these were military insurrections and Diocletian's edict may have followed these and similar acts of conscience and faith. An unknown number of Christians appear to have suffered the extreme and exemplary punishments traditionally reserved for rebels and traitors.|$|E
25|$|Pan Zhang {{was from}} Fagan County (發干縣), Dong Commandery (東郡), {{which is located}} east of present-day Guan County, Shandong. In 196, he became a {{follower}} of a 14-year-old Sun Quan, who was then serving as the Chief (長) of Yangxian County (陽羨縣) under his elder brother Sun Ce, who controlled many territories in the Jiangdong region. Pan Zhang was a heavy drinker and compulsive gambler, {{and he had to}} frequently borrow money to support these habits because his family was poor. When his creditors came to pursue debts, he always claimed that he would pay them back when he became wealthy. Sun Quan felt that Pan Zhang <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and favoured him, so he sent Pan on a recruitment drive. Pan Zhang returned with more than 100 men and Sun Quan appointed him as a military officer. He became a Major of Separate Command (別部司馬) after defeating some bandits. Later, he was appointed as a da shi cijian (大巿刺姧; similar to a police chief) in Wu Commandery (吳郡; around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) and became famous after achieving success in maintaining high standards of security in the area. He was reassigned to be the Chief (長) of Xi'an County (西安縣; present-day Wuning County, Jiangxi) later.|$|E

25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding <b>was</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E
