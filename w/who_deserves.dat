25|$|The Greek myths {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for a number of}} operas. Claudio Monteverdi and Giacomo Badoaro used a Greek text about the homecoming of Odysseus as the basis for Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria over which they attempted to overlay Christian beliefs and create in Zeus an omnipotent and merciful being. Cherubini's Médée takes the story which had been portrayed in many version on the French stage as a melodrama, and instead portrays Medea as a tragic heroine <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> the audiences' sympathy.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and surgical technique. However, {{despite all this}} progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated pain, many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although {{there has been a}} great deal of debate as to <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.|$|E

In Athens, when they track down Zaiad Muchasi, the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safe house with their rival PLO members, and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending {{to be members of}} foreign terrorist groups like ETA, IRA, ANC, and the Red Army Faction. Avner has a heartfelt conversation with PLO member Ali over their homelands and <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> to rule over the lands; Ali is later shot by Carl while the team escapes from the hit on Muchasi.|$|E
25|$|A {{club for}} cricket was opened in 1877 at Longwood Estate, a place {{named after the}} house Napoleon Bonaparte stayed at while exiled to Saint Helena. Located on the {{outskirts}} of Boston, cricketers and baseball players put Longwood on the sports map. Specifically, Harry Wright, first player-manager of the Boston Red Stockings, played cricket for the United States, as did his brother George Wright. George Wright combined with tennis pro Charlie Chambers in league games throughout New England and played at Longwood against Lord Harris' XI in 1891. George Wright was the co-proprietor of Wright and Ditman, purveyor of fine sports goods. Wright brought the first tennis gear to Boston on his return from a baseball-cricket tour of England in 1874. Wright also taught tennis to Harvard students and toured with them in California in 1890. It was George Wright <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> the credit for Longwood's broad-based sporting tradition, having excelled in baseball and cricket as a paid professional and at tennis as an imaginative promoter of the game. A lawn tennis court was laid in 1878, two years after the organization of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. On January 5, 1888, Longwood member and US cricket team captain C.L. Bixby led the team to a win over the West Indies cricket team at the Bourda ground in Georgetown, Guyana. Richard D. Sears, who won seven United States Championships, would soon become a club member as well.|$|E

He made his debut on 11 August, {{the opening day of}} the 2007–08 season, in a 2–1 victory over Halifax Town. Following a 3–1 defeat to Stafford Rangers for Weymouth, manager Jason Tindall singled out Critchell for praise, saying; [...] "The only one out there today <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> any credit for their performance was Kyle Critchell but overall it was not good enough".

500|$|Benchley {{had written}} Jaws after reading about sport {{fisherman}} Frank Mundus's capture {{of an enormous}} shark in 1964. According to Gottlieb, Quint was loosely based on Mundus, whose book Sportfishing for Sharks he read for research. Sackler {{came up with the}} backstory of Quint as a survivor of the World War II [...] disaster. The question of <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> the most credit for writing Quint's monologue about the Indianapolis has caused substantial controversy. Spielberg described it as a collaboration between Sackler, Milius, and actor Robert Shaw, who was also a playwright. According to the director, Milius turned Sackler's [...] "three-quarters of a page" [...] speech into a monologue, and that was then rewritten by Shaw. Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius's contribution.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Sepinwall was {{disappointed with the}} overall storyline of the [...] "green reality"; he claimed that if the episode was only based on the [...] "red reality", the entry would have been [...] "perfectly fine". Meanwhile, Handlen thought that if the arcs of the [...] "red reality" [...] {{were not included in}} this installment, it would not work as an episode. While Sepinwall called the [...] "green reality" [...] storyline [...] "boring", Handlen thought that the storylines of Marcus and Alina did not [...] "matter"; according to Handlen, the episode should not have gotten into the details of the guest stars. Sepinwall and Handlen were disappointed that Rex did not appear in the episode; Handlen praised Rex, calling him a [...] "likable teenage boy" [...] <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> more running time.|$|E

500|$|Among the deputies, Saint-Just was watchful but interacted {{little at}} first. He joined the Parisian Jacobin Club but he {{remained}} aloof from Girondins and Montagnards alike. He waited until 13 November 1792 {{to give his}} first speech to the Convention, but when he did the effect was spectacular. What {{brought him to the}} lectern was the discussion over how to treat the king after Varennes. In dramatic contrast to the earlier speakers, Saint-Just delivered a blazing condemnation of the king. He demanded that [...] "Louis Capet" [...] should be judged not as a king or even a citizen, but as a traitor, an enemy <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> death. [...] "As for me," [...] he declared, [...] "I see no middle ground: this man must reign or die! He oppressed a free nation; he declared himself its enemy; he abused the laws: he must die to assure the repose of the people, since it was in his mind to crush the people to assure his own.” ...|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Mukerji {{achieved}} further success when Yash Chopra {{cast her}} alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in his romantic drama Veer-Zaara.

With a worldwide gross of over , Veer-Zaara emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year; it was screened at the Berlin Film Festival and met with critical acclaim. Mukerji's role was praised by the critics; BBC noted, [...] "ts Rani Mukerjee <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> praise for her acting. To act through your eyes and not using dialogue is an art. Rani for one, has perfected this." [...] She won the Best Supporting Actress trophy at the IIFA Awards ceremony, and received a nomination in the same category at Filmfare.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is the sort of person who would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E

500|$|Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4.8/5 {{and said that}} he did not think the episode could have been {{executed}} better. Wolfe emphasized Ziva's back story with her father and speculated that many of her choices were based upon events that her family experienced, including her father's repeated absences and the breakup of her parents' marriage due to Eli's indiscretions with a young Orli Elbaz, which also explained Ziva's resentment of Elbaz. [...] Wolfe was touched by Ziva's dance with Tony, and her flashback to dancing with her father as a child while he tells her, [...] "My Ziva. One day you will dance with a man <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> your love". In a TV Fanatic round table, Steve Marsi added, [...] "What an emotionally loaded quote from the Eli flashback, followed by the much-anticipated present-day dance." [...] He {{went on to say that}} Sirtis did well as the new Mossad director and that [...] "Counselor Deanna Troi was nothing but a faint memory". Michelle Calbert from TV Equals praised the storyline and agreed that Marina Sirtis performed well in the role, saying that she found Orli to be a more likeable character than Eli David.|$|E

[...] In 2007, giving a speech on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Armenian Armed Forces, the Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan (and the incumbent president) noted that he [...] "was a valiant soldier dedicated to the cause of our statehood, and who revered the strength of Armenia and the strength of the Armenian soldier, and who had a staunch belief in our future success." ...|$|E
500|$|Alice's matrimonial {{plans were}} begun in 1860 by her mother. Queen Victoria had {{expressed}} her wish that her children should marry for love, {{but this did}} not mean that her choice of suitors would necessarily be extended to anybody outside the royal houses of Europe. Raising a British subject to royalty, however high their rank, was politically objectionable, and also wasted any opportunity for a useful foreign alliance. The Queen instructed her daughter Victoria, recently married to Prince Frederick of Prussia, to produce a list of eligible princes in Europe. Her search produced only two suitable candidates: the Prince of Orange; and Prince Albert of Prussia, cousin to Victoria's husband Frederick. The Prince of Orange was soon discounted. He journeyed to Windsor Castle so that Queen Victoria could look him over in person, but he proved unpalatable to Alice. The prince too showed little interest in Alice, despite strong pressure from his pro-British mother, Queen Sophie of the Netherlands. Prince Albert, too, was spurned, with Prince Frederick of Prussia remarking that his cousin would not do for [...] "one <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> the very best".|$|E

500|$|Many historians praised Paraná. Maurílio de Gouveia {{regarded}} {{him as a}} statesman who revealed [...] "himself to posterity {{as an example of}} tenacity, energy, patriotism and honor". To Heitor Lira, Paraná [...] "was one of the pillars responsible for the political stability of PedroII's reign. His policy of conciliation ended a period of rebellions, and led to the appearance {{of a new generation of}} monarchist politicians raised [...] "in the school of tolerance, mutual respect and public interest"; which produced [...] "the constitutional environment where the two great [...] parties of the Monarchy would take turns [...] without excluding each other." [...] Fernando da Cruz Gouvêa called him an [...] "authentic statesman". Aldo Janotti considered Paraná, alongside Vasconcelos, responsible for the maintenance of Brazilian unity and preventing its territorial dismemberment. According to Hermes Vieira, he was a [...] "great statesman". [...] "Of all politicians of imperial Brazil, it is without a doubt," [...] said historian Hélio Viana, [...] "Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná, the one <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> to be called statesman". Ronaldo Vainfas considered him one of the greatest statesmen in Brazilian imperial history.|$|E
500|$|U.S. {{ambassador}} Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. {{had other}} ideas. Instead of sending embassy officials to Tân Sơn Nhứt airport, Lodge sent CIA agent Lucien Conein, {{who had helped}} the Vietnamese generals to plan the coup. Conein turned Cẩn over to the junta. Lodge said that General Đôn had promised that Cẩn would be dealt with [...] "legally and judicially". The ambassador told Washington that asylum was unnecessary, saying [...] "It {{seems to me that}} our reason for giving him asylum therefore no longer exists". He said that the U.S. could not interfere with justice, since Cẩn was [...] "undoubtedly a reprehensible figure <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> all the loathing which he now receives". Lodge reasoned that since Cẩn would not be killed, protecting him would give the impression that the U.S. backed his activities. Lodge said that General Dương Văn Minh, who was the President, implied that Cẩn would receive clemency even if sentenced to death. This contradicted Conein's assertion that the ARVN officer corps felt that Cẩn should be executed. Cẩn's case was damaged by the release {{of tens of thousands of}} political prisoners, who recounted tales of torture at the hands of the Ngô brothers.|$|E
500|$|Monster {{established}} {{a partnership with}} rap mogul Dr. Dre and Interscope Records in 2007 to design and manufacture the Beats Electronics line of headphones called [...] "Beats by Dr. Dre". This led to a trend among headphone manufacturers to create celebrity-endorsed products. Monster created similar partnerships with Lady Gaga for the Heartbeats brand of headphones in 2009, PDiddy's Diddybeats in May 2010 and LeBron James later that year. In 2010, Monster began developing a series of products for the Chinese market that were co-branded with basketball player Yao Ming. According to analyst firm NPD Group, the Beats brand that Monster distributed exclusively grew to own 53 percent of a $1 billion headphones market. A 51 percent interest in Beats was sold to HTC in August 2011. At {{the end of the}} five-year agreement between Monster and Dr. Dre in 2012, Dre decided not to renew. According to Bloomberg, both parties said the separation was [...] "amicable" [...] but they had disagreements on <b>who</b> <b>deserves</b> credit and the share of revenues. The partnership was responsible for a substantial portion of Monster's revenues. After the split, Monster created its own headphones product line and other celebrity-branded headphones with music groups Earth, Wind & Fire and Miles Davis.|$|E
