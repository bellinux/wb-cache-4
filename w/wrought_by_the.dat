5|$|The 1899 New Richmond Tornado was an {{estimated}} EF5 tornado which formed {{on the early}} evening of June 12, 1899 and tore a 45-mile long path of destruction through St. Croix, Polk and Barron counties in west-central Wisconsin, leaving 117 people dead, twice as many injured and hundreds homeless. The worst devastation <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tornado was at the city of New Richmond, Wisconsin, which took a direct hit from the storm. Over half the town was left in ruins by the tornado, which also caused lesser damage to several other communities in the area. More than $300,000 (USD) ($ in today's dollars) in damage was reported. Today, it ranks as the ninth deadliest tornado in United States history, {{as well as the}} deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The Government of India {{declared}} a national {{disaster in the}} aftermath of the cyclone, though international appeals were initially unanticipated. The destruction <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cyclone was expected to cause a six-month-long total loss of normal livelihood. Damage sustained to various sanitation infrastructure led to a heightened risk of communicable disease outbreaks; indeed, diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following the storm's impact. Within a month of the cyclone's landfall, the Odishan government reported 22,296cases of diarrheal disorders. The area's vulnerability to disease was also compounded by a lack of pre-storm vaccinations, raising fears of a potential measles outbreak. The outbreak of diseases caused by the storm's effects stabilized by February2000. For most locations, the initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{crisis of}} his early reign, the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), led to the First Partition of Poland (1772).

These reforms were overthrown by the 1792 Targowica Confederation and by the War in Defense of the Constitution, leading directly to the Second Partition of Poland (1793), the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) and the final Third Partition of Poland (1795), marking {{the end of the}} Commonwealth.

5|$|Although {{its primary}} effects were felt in a {{localized}} area of India, the outer {{fringes of the}} super cyclone impacted Myanmar and Bangladesh. Ten {{people were killed in}} the former, while two were killed in the latter by the storm's rainbands. The storm was the most severe to strike Odisha in the 20th century, raking the state and adjacent areas with high storm surge, powerful winds, and torrential rainfall. The storm's impacts exacerbated the damage caused by a very severe cyclone that struck the same region less than two weeks earlier. The 5–6m (16–20ft) surge brought water up to 35km (20mi) inland, carrying along with it coastal debris and inundating towns and villages. The surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding, damaging around 1.6million homes and causing rivers to breach 20,005flood embankments. The storm's effects destroyed numerous crops, including sugar cane, rice, and other winter-time harvests. Although estimates of the death toll varied significantly—at times suggesting 30,000fatalities—the Government of India enumerated 9,887fatalities in the country, of which a majority were caused by storm surge; over 8,000deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. The total damage cost of the destruction <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> super cyclone amounted to US$4.44billion.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{management}} {{officials in}} Fredericton {{stated that it}} could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm. Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July16 with only 750customers still out. However, a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of the power grid as outages jumped back over 4,000. The following week, Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary, despite the longevity and severity of the power outages. New Brunswick's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company, while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary. The total cost to restore and repair damage to the power grid <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> storm amounted to C$8.4million (US$7.5million). This ranked it as the second-costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone, only behind Hurricane Juan. New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C$23million (US$20.1million). This marked the costliest disaster in the company's history, surpassing the December 2013 ice storm. In light of the severe damage, NB Power allocated an extra C$5.1million (US$4.5million) for tree trimming during the 2014-2014 fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Reports of a {{potentially}} destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate {{prior to the}} storm moving inland. Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4ft (1.95m) on {{the western edge of}} Lake Pontchartrain. The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the U.S. Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. However, much of the property and crop damage <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. Rainfall peaked at 37.5in (953mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana observed record 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August {{as a result of the}} slow-moving hurricane. Property, livestock, and crops – especially cotton, corn, and pecan crops – were heavily damaged. Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall. Overall, the storm caused $10.75million in damages and seven fatalities.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{brought a}} storm surge of 10–12 ft (3–3.5 m) to Tampa Bay. The highest rainfall total in Tampa was at 8.53 in (23.5 mm). However, the observer noted that winds probably blew {{water out of}} the gauge. The barometric pressure fell to , breaking a previous record set in 1910. The hurricane also brought sustained winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) and a storm tide of 10.5 ft (3 m). Damage from the wind was generally minor, while most of the impact <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> storm was due to abnormally high tides in Tampa and elsewhere in the area. Much of the city was flooded, with the worst along Bayshore Boulevard, where some of the most expensive properties were located. At Hyde Park, dwellings were inundated about halfway up the first story, prompting several people to be rescued by boat. Electrical poles and wires were washed away near the intersection of Bayshore Boulevard and Howard Avenue. The latter was also left impassible by car. In the Palmetto Beach neighborhood, much of the section was inundated. A group of about 40 volunteers rescued a number of women and children. A total of 50 homes were destroyed by cedar logs used to construct cigar boxes at the Tampa Box Company on 22nd Street.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands.

On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process. On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage <b>wrought</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E
