500|$|By {{the time}} El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example {{continued}} to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined {{to make his own}} mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> Michelangelo, El Greco replied that [...] "he was a good man, but {{he did not know how}} to paint". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but he had found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.|$|E

40|$|How are beliefs efficacious? One answer is: via {{rational}} intentional action. But {{there are}} other ways that beliefs are efficacious. This dissertation examines these other ways, and sketches an {{answer to the question of}} how beliefs are efficacious that takes into account how beliefs are involved in the full range of behavioral disciplines, from psychophysiology and cognition to social and economic phenomena. The account of how beliefs are efficacious I propose draws on work on active accounts of perception. I develop an account based on a proposal sketched by the cognitive scientist Ulrich Neisser. Neisser sketched an active account of perception, on which dynamic anticipatory schemata direct an organism's exploration and action, and are in turn revised as a result of exploration and action. This notion of schema has roots in nineteenth century neurophysiology and in Frederick Bartlett's subsequent work on memory. Neisser appealed to it to unite <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> was right <b>about</b> information-processing accounts of perception with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> was right <b>about</b> ecological accounts of perception. The point that we must anticipate in order to perceive has been recognized by philosophers in the form of the "theory-ladenness of observation. " I extend the concept of anticipatory schema to include its role in social perception and social interaction; the concept of anticipatory schema provides a more interactive account of the role of expectations in the maintenance and existence of social institutions, and can be used to enrich the account of convention David Lewis provided. I also show that the concept of rational expectations, which explains the neutrality of money in terms of the efficacy of anticipatory expectations, is compatible with the proposed account of how beliefs are efficacious. I discuss how the proposal accounts for the three main modes by which beliefs can be efficacious: (i) via their role in causing intentional action, (ii) via their role in causing economic phenomena and the existence and maintenance of social institutions, and (iii) via their role in causing unintentional physiological responses, including anticipatory physiological responses that can enable perception, cause involuntary actions and give rise to the placebo effect...|$|R

40|$|The Doctrine of Affections was a {{widespread}} understanding {{of music and}} musicality during the Baroque era.

It was a reconciliation of practical musicianship and theoretical music which had begun to rise in the time. Though it is generally understood as being apart from Enlightenment thinking, the Doctrine is a result of Enlightenment-style philosophy. As the Enlightenment sought to explain why things occurred in nature, the Doctrine of Affections aimed to explain scientifically man’s reaction to music. It presumed that emotions could be represented and elicited through specific figurations of music and it perceived that music could possibly relate with the body humors and remedy illness and imbalance. The Doctrine of Affections directly shapes musical composition through specific modes and tonalities, meters, and rhythms all culminating in the “Baroque” style. Its influence is overwhelmingly present in the music of J. S. Bach and Handel. Affections, in conjunction with the four temperaments and body humors, thusly result in specific emotional reactions in listeners...|$|R

Tom Gaunt, not long in from work, {{was sitting in his}} shirtsleeves, reading the paper--a short, thick-set man with small eyes, round, ruddy cheeks, and humorous lips indifferently concealed by a ragged moustache. Even in repose there was about him something talkative and disputatious. He was clearly the kind of man whose eyes and wit would sparkle above a pewter pot. A good workman, he averaged out an income of perhaps eighteen shillings a week, counting the two shillings' worth of vegetables that he grew. His erring daughter washed for two old ladies in a bungalow, so that with old Gaunt's five shillings from the parish, the total resources of this family of five, including two small boys at school, was seven and twenty shillings a week. Quite a sum! His comparative wealth no doubt contributed to the reputation of Tom Gaunt, well known as local wag and disturber of political meetings. His method with these gatherings, whether Liberal or Tory, had a certain masterly simplicity. By interjecting questions that could not be understood, and commenting on the answers received, he insured perpetual laughter, with the most salutary effects on the over-consideration of any political question, together with a tendency to make his neighbors say: [...] "Ah! Tom Gaunt, he's a proper caution, he is!" [...] An encomium dear to his ears. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> seriously <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> anything in this world, no one knew; but some suspected him of voting Liberal, because he disturbed their meetings most.

They tried to answer his taunts, but a cub might as well have tried to answer Kaa in a rage; and all the while Mowgli's right hand lay crooked at his side, ready for action, his feet locked round the branch. The big bay leader had leaped many times in the air, but Mowgli dared not risk a false blow. At last, made furious beyond his natural strength, he bounded up seven or eight feet clear of the ground. Then Mowgli's hand shot out like the head of a tree-snake, and gripped him by the scruff of his neck, and the branch shook with the jar as his weight fell back, almost wrenching Mowgli to the ground. But he never loosed his grip, and inch by inch he hauled the beast, hanging like a drowned jackal, up on the branch. With his left hand he reached for his knife and cut off the red, bushy tail, flinging the dhole back to earth again. That was all he needed. The Pack would not go forward on Won-tolla's trail now till they had killed Mowgli or Mowgli had killed them. He saw them settle down in circles with a quiver of the haunches that meant they were going to stay, and so he climbed to a higher crotch, settled his back comfortably, and went to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|... "It's a {{historical}} {{fact that at}} Ashoka'stime science was widely suppressed—that was a trigger for me to write my book, {{which is based on}} science and not fantasy... The Hindu History compares all the Hindu scriptures and narrates the history of kings present 5,000 years ago. In fact, {{he was one of the}} first to suggest that Hindu gods were humans. —Doyle talking about The Mahabharata Secret [...] Author Christopher C. Doyle had studied Business Management from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta and runs a firm for training CEO and CXOs. However, he always had a childhood weakness for fantasy novels, being inspired by authors like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, J. R. R. Tolkien as well as Robert Jordan. One day he started writing a novel for his daughter, who was interested in stories based on fantasy and science. However, as she grew older, she wanted a more mature story. It was then that Doyle decided to expand the story and write it into a full novel. He was inspired by a 1917 book he had read, The Hindu History by Akshay Majumdar, which wrote about an alternate history of India by combining legends and mythology. Doyle was also intrigued by the Indian epic Mahabharata which translated into [...] "this is <b>what</b> happened". <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the basis of the epic in history and science and moved forward with his writing. Two other books contributed to his inspiration and research, Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock and Uriel's Machine by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. Reading all the books Doyle believed about the possibility of the existence of an alternate history which was probably not recorded in antiquity. He deduced that the Mahabharata would not be just an epic story or epic poem, but {{a historical}} record of events that occurred many years ago. The author added:And if the Mahabharata was true, then it was possible that some of the fantastic events described in the Mahabharata could have a scientific base as well, which no one has explored as of now. This fascinating thought lingered in my mind and propelled me to explore this aspect further. So that's really how history, mythology and science came together.While continuing research for the book, Doyle came across the legends surrounding King Ashoka, including those of the Nine Men, and his alleged suppression of science. Hence the plot about the brotherhood of the Nine was born from it, dating it between 200 BC to 500 BC. Doyle wrote about something hidden in the Mahabharata that was scientific as well as dangerous explaining it with Physics, thus giving rise to the main story. The author visited The Asiatic Society in Kolkata to peruse of the useful material there on Ashoka, and also to look at one of the rock edicts of the emperor preserved there. Since only members of the society were allowed to read there, Doyle had to redeem himself as a regular person and researcher in order to access the vaults.
