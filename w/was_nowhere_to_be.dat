5|$|After a night-time advance, the 20th Battalion was {{positioned}} {{on the ridge}} in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions. On daybreak, {{it was discovered that}} the advance had bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. The supporting British armour <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen and the supporting artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made a dash through enemy lines to make contact with the British armour. On reaching one of the British brigades, its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up. By the time the armoured support arrived, the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun, leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, the {{supporting}} British armour <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen and the artillery and anti-tank units {{were unable to}} break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising {{the degree to which}} his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} December 30, the 4th South Vietnamese Marine Battalion {{moved out to}} Biên Hòa Air Base, waiting to be airlifted into the battlefield. The 1/4th Marine Battalion was the first unit to arrive on the {{outskirts}} of Bình Giã, but the 1st Company commander decided to secure the landing zone, to wait {{for the rest of the}} battalion to arrive instead of moving on to their objective. After the rest of the 4th Marine Battalion had arrived, they marched towards the Catholic church to relieve the besieged Rangers. About one and a half hours later, the 4th Marine Battalion linked up with the 30th, 33rd and 38th Ranger Battalions, as the Viet Cong began withdrawing to the northeast. That afternoon the 4th Marine Battalion recaptured the village, but the Viet Cong <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, as all their units had withdrawn from the village during the previous night, linking with other Viet Cong elements in the forest to attack the government relief forces. On the evening of December 30, the Viet Cong returned to Bình Giã and attacked from the south-eastern perimeter of the village. The local villagers, who discovered the approaching Viet Cong, immediately sounded the alarm to alert the ARVN soldiers defending the village. The South Vietnamese were able to repel the Viet Cong, with support from U.S. Army helicopter gunships flown out from Vung Tau airbase.|$|E

By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to guerrilla tactics, and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a video which purported to show him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters.

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain their pre-war status at the {{forefront}} of the avant-garde, and faced with the possibility of being overthrown by Dada, the cubists regrouped. Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't going to be easy. Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées. Picasso <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.|$|E
25|$|The remote hilly Lan Xang proved most troublesome. He {{personally}} led the two-pronged {{invasion of}} Lan Xang in October 1569. Setthathirath made a stand at Vientiane {{for a few}} months before retreating into the jungle in February 1570 to conduct his tried-and-true guerrilla warfare. Bayinnaung and his men spent the next two months combing the Lao countryside. Setthathirath <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found but many Burmese troops died of starvation and from long marches. He finally called off the search in April 1570, and returned home. When the king arrived back at Pegu, very few men of the original army survived to reach their own country.|$|E
25|$|Following {{independence}} cricket remained {{very much}} a minority sport in Myanmar, and <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen between 1988 and 1995. In 2002 the game was seeing a resurgence, with a seven team league organised by former Bengal first class player Naresh Kumar, with some former first class players taking part in games attended by around 250 people. Cricket has also been featured on TV news reports. The Myanmar Cricket Federation received {{a visit from the}} ICC in 2004 and became an affiliate member of the organisation in 2006. The game is currently played primarily by ex-pats, but the game has recently been introduced into schools.|$|E

25|$|On September 11, 1987, Rather marched off-camera {{in anger}} {{just before a}} remote {{broadcast}} of the program when it appeared that CBS Sports' coverage of a U.S. Open tennis semifinal match between Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil was going to overrun into time allotted for his program. Rather was in Miami covering the visit to the city by Pope John Paul II. When the tennis match ended sooner than expected at 6:32p.m. Eastern Time, Rather <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found. Six minutes of dead air followed before {{he returned to the}} broadcast position; nearly half of the audience watched and waited. Rather apologized for the outburst the next day.

25|$|Also as {{previously}} mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series {{for a national}} television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At {{some point during the}} game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history.|$|E
25|$|During the {{two years}} that followed, only a few {{companies}} of the regiment would see active service, campaigning in Spain, where they accompanied Bessières in northwestern Spain, where the latter was supposed to support André Masséna's Army of Portugal. Masséna had been busy besieging general Wellington in Lisbon, {{but he was not}} able to pierce the fortified Lines of Torres Vedras and subsequently retreated to Almeida. Wellington made the critical error of following him and on May 5, 1809, he found himself in an awkward position at the battle of Fuentes de Oñoro. Masséna needed Bessières' entire Army Corps, if he wanted to thoroughly beat the Anglo-Portuguese, but Bessières brought only symbolic reinforcements: a few squadrons of horse dragoons and grenadiers, 800 men in all, under the command of general Louis Lepic. Despite this setback, Masséna brilliantly exploited a weakness in Wellington's line and it soon seemed like the Anglo-Portuguese would be crushed. Time was at the essence and Masséna promptly sent his young aide-de-camp, Charles Oudinot, to find Lepic and the Guard cavalry, with orders to charge immediately, but Oudinot was soon back to his commander, saying that {{he was not able to}} fetch the Guard cavalry, because Lepic only recognized Bessières as commander and that he would not draw his sword without his order. Bessières <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found, allowing Wellington's army to escape intact.|$|E
