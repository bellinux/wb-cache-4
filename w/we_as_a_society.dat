For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E

The central question: where will <b>we</b> be <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>society</b> in five years’ time? Should we feel hopeful, or should we feel despair? In four minute bursts, our panel of five prominent thinkers each make an informed, impassioned case for optimism – and counter with an equally persuasive case against it. It 2 ̆ 7 s public debate of a kind that bucks binaries, marginalises myopia and penalises pigheadedness.
