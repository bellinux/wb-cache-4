5|$|Breaking Benjamin is an American {{rock band}} from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup {{of the band}} also {{included}} guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, Saturate (2002) and <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Alone</b> (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.|$|E
25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few remarks about the domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E

[...] Veteran actor Tsutomu Yamazaki was selected for the role of Sasaki; Takita had worked with Yamazaki on <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Alone</b> (1993).

60|$|But <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> The stable-man who {{had lied}} {{to me about the}} fishing was there; the boy who {{had lied to}} me about the {{reception}} of cyclers was there; the lemon-faced woman was there, standing close to Mrs. Chester; and there were two maids looking out of the window of the kitchen.|$|R
500|$|Breaking Benjamin {{returned}} to the studio in October 2003 with producer David Bendeth for their sophomore effort <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Alone.</b> Burnley also worked with The Smashing Pumpkins front man Billy Corgan {{over the course of}} six days in December 2003 to write the songs [...] "Rain", [...] "Forget It", and [...] "Follow". Despite initially being nervous, Burnley felt {{it was one of the}} highlights of his career.|$|E
500|$|<b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Alone</b> {{garnered}} mixed reviews. It was {{met with}} high acclaim from IGN's Colin Moriarty, who felt [...] "extremely satisfied," [...] saying [...] "safely and confidently" [...] that it [...] "might be my personal favorite album of the year," [...] giving it a score of 9.3 out of 10. Conversely, Exclaim! writer Amber Authier felt that, [...] "On first listen its simply generic sound did nothing for me," [...] though later admitted, [...] "I listened to Breaking Benjamin several times over a week and several elements of the disc started to grow on me, even appeal to me." [...] The writer concluded, [...] "Breaking Benjamin created a standard of quality for themselves that they simply couldn't meet on the entire disc." ...|$|E
500|$|Breaking Benjamin's musical {{style is}} {{primarily}} classified as hard rock and alternative rock, more specifically post-grunge and alternative metal, and has commonly been {{noted for its}} consistency. Corey Apar felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin are nothing if not consistent", and Alex Young felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin {{is one of the}} few modern rock bands on the radio that, if you have heard any song in its catalog prior, could be immediately recognized." [...] Despite a complete lineup change prior to the release of Dark Before Dawn, Dan Marsicano stated, [...] "Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony. They have had an established sound since their breakout <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Alone</b> – hard-edged riffs with emotional upheaval – and that isn't tampered with on Dark Before Dawn." ...|$|E
50|$|What helped {{our journey}} was the {{knowledge}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> - our readers stood by us through thick and thin. When we did a good job, they patted our backs. When we occasionally failed to deliver as per our usual high standards, they gently reprimanded us. By keeping us on our toes, they spurred us to give our best. By consistently sending us three-year subscriptions, they provided stability to our aspirations. Without a doubt, we owe the biggest debt of gratitude to them.|$|R
6000|$|The {{loss of a}} {{good working}} day soon made itself felt. The north wind rose, causing the lively Mukhbir, whose ballast, by-the-by, was all on deck, to waddle dangerously for the poor mules; and it was agreed, nem. con., to put into Tor harbour.

"You see, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone,</b> aunts," [...] Lucy said; [...] "the Confederate {{officer and}} his servant were coming through and, of course, they {{took care of}} us.

500|$|In late 2005, drummer Hummel filed {{a federal}} lawsuit against Breaking Benjamin. According to the lawsuit, Hummel {{requested}} earlier that year {{to take a}} paternity leave {{to be with his}} wife during the birth of their first child, to which all members of the band agreed and hired Kevin Soffera as a temporary substitute on drums. However, Burnley later called Hummel and terminated him, citing chemistry issues. In the lawsuit, Hummel contended wrongful termination and lack of compensation for profits accrued by <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Alone</b> and other non-album tracks that appeared in Halo 2 and [...] The band's manager, Larry Mazer (who was also named in the lawsuit), asserted that the lawsuit was [...] "totally frivolous" [...] and his termination had [...] "nothing to do with the paternity leave." [...] Mazer said the band received no payment for the Halo 2 appearance, adding that the song was included for promotional reasons and Burnley was happy to have it in the video game. The band received minimal payment for the National Treasure 2 appearance, and Mazer stated that otherwise, [...] " [...] is 100 per cent current." [...] Ben [...] "B.C." [...] Vaught served as a sit-in drummer for the band, and they later toured with 3 Doors Down and Staind in November 2005. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in April 2006.|$|E

60|$|It was {{her last}} taunt. It was over. I {{had heard the}} worst. The arrow I {{had been waiting for}} had sprung true to its mark. Its barb was {{sticking}} there in my side. And yet, as I mutely looked up at her, I knew there was a word between us which neither could utter. The empty air had swallowed up the sound of our voices. Its enormous looking-glass remained placid and indifferent. It was as if all that we had said, or, for that matter, suffered, was of no account, simply because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> For the first instant in the intimacy of my love and hatred, Fanny seemed to be just any young woman standing there, spiteful, meaningless.

[...] The manner in which Wikileaks publishes content can {{have the effect of}} censoring political enemies: [...] "Wikileaks' indiscriminate disclosure in this case is perhaps the closest we’ve seen in reality to the bogeyman projected by enemies to reform — that transparency is just a Trojan Horse for chilling speech and silencing political enemies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to performing, Corgan has produced albums for Ric Ocasek, The Frogs, and Catherine. He shared songwriting credit on several songs on Hole's 1998 album Celebrity Skin; {{the title track}} became Corgan's second No. 1 modern rock hit. He also acted as a consultant for Marilyn Manson during the recording of the album Mechanical Animals. He has produced three soundtracks for the movies Ransom (1996), Stigmata (1999) and Spun (2002) in which he appeared as a doctor. Corgan appeared at the 1996 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremonies. He inducted {{one of his biggest}} musical influences, Pink Floyd. He played acoustic guitar during the ceremony with Pink Floyd, when they performed their song [...] "Wish You Were Here". He has collaborated with Tony Iommi, Blindside, David Bowie, New Order and Marianne Faithfull. Corgan would also guide and collaborate with three bands in the 2000s—Breaking Benjamin (during sessions for 2004's <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Alone),</b> Taproot (for Blue-Sky Research, 2005), and Sky Saxon. Corgan appeared as a guest vocalist on the song [...] "Loki Cat" [...] on Jimmy Chamberlin's first solo album, Life Begins Again, and Chamberlin played drums for the song [...] "DIA" [...] on Corgan's solo debut, where Robert Smith from The Cure teamed up with Corgan to do a cover of the Bee Gees' [...] "To Love Somebody".|$|E
60|$|More, {{something}} oppressed us; we did {{not dare}} to speak. We went on a few paces and stopped, for we became aware that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> Indeed, {{it seemed to me}} that we stood in the midst of a thronging multitude, but not of men and women. Beings pressed about us; we could feel their robes, yet could not touch them; we could feel their breath, but it was cold. The air stirred all round us as they passed to and fro, passed in endless numbers. It <b>was</b> as though <b>we</b> had entered a cathedral filled with the vast congregation of all the dead who once had worshipped there. We grew afraid--my face was damp with fear, the hair stood up upon my head. We seemed to have wandered into a hall of the Shades.|$|R

60|$|I {{had little}} or no {{difficulty}} in believing this, it being no unusual thing, among us, to find observances of this nature clinging to the habits of thousands, long after the devout feeling which had first instilled it into the race has become extinct.
