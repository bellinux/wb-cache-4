So they sent for him, and desired him that he would a second time go with their petition to the Prince, and he readily told them he would.

Often had he seen it in model and in quiescence in its boat-house, ponderous and almost ungainly; but now he saw {{it for the first time}} in action, as if endued with life. So, we fancy, warriors might speak of our heavy cavalry as we see them in barracks and as they saw them at Alma.|$|E

6000|$|But I suppose I cannot {{reasonably}} hope {{to convince}} you that we have any principles. The most I can expect is to assure you that {{we think we have}} and are quite contented with them. The other day one of the gentlemen from Georgia [Mr. Iverson], an eloquent man, and a man of learning, so far as I can judge, not being learned myself, came down upon us astonishingly. He spoke in what the 'Baltimore American' calls the [...] "scathing and withering style." [...] At the end of his second severe flash I was struck blind, and found myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my continued existence. A little of the bone was left, and I gradually revived. He eulogized Mr. Clay in high and beautiful terms, and then declared that we had deserted all our principles, and had turned Henry Clay out, like an old horse, to root. This is terribly severe. It cannot be answered by argument--at least I cannot so answer it. I merely wish to ask the gentleman if the Whigs are the only party he can think of who sometimes turn old horses out to root. Is not a certain Martin Van Buren an old horse which your own party have turned out to root? and is he not rooting a little to your discomfort about now? But in not nominating Mr. Clay we deserted our principles, you say. Ah! In what? Tell us, ye men of principle, what principle we violated. We say you did violate principle in discarding Van Buren, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how. You violated the primary, the cardinal, the one great living principle of all democratic representative government--the principle that the representative is bound to carry out the known will of his constituents. A large majority of the Baltimore convention of 1844 were, by their constituents, instructed to procure Van Buren 's nomination if they could. In violation--in utter glaring contempt of this, you rejected him; rejected him, as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Birdsall] the other day expressly admitted, for availability--that same [...] "general availability" [...] which you charge upon us, and daily chew over here, as something exceedingly odious and unprincipled. But the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Iverson] gave us a second speech yesterday, all well considered and put down in writing, in which Van Buren was scathed and withered a [...] "few" [...] for his present position and movements. I cannot remember the gentleman's precise language; but I do remember he put Van Buren down, down, till he got him where he was finally to [...] "stink" [...] and [...] "rot." ...|$|E
6000|$|As typical a {{novel of}} the oracular kind as we can hope to meet with, is “The Enigma: a Leaf from the Chronicles of the Wolchorley House.” The “enigma” which this novel is to solve is {{certainly}} one that demands powers no less gigantic than those of a lady novelist, being neither more nor less than the existence of evil. The problem is stated and the answer dimly foreshadowed on the very first page. The spirited young lady, with raven hair, says, “All life is an inextricable confusion;” and the meek young lady, with auburn hair, looks {{at the picture of}} the Madonna which she is copying, and—“There seemed the solution of that mighty enigma.” The style of this novel is quite as lofty as its purpose; indeed, some passages on which we have spent much patient study are quite beyond our reach, in spite of the illustrative aid of italics and small caps; and we must await further “development” in order to understand them. Of Ernest, the model young clergyman, who sets every one right on all occasions, we read that “he held not of marriage in the marketable kind, after a social desecration;” that, on one eventful night, “sleep had not visited his divided heart, where tumultuated, in varied type and combination, the aggregate feelings of grief and joy;” and that, “for the marketable human article he had no toleration, be it of what sort, or set for what value it might, whether for worship or class, his upright soul abhorred it, whose ultimatum, the self-deceiver, was to him THE great spiritual lie, ‘living in a vain show, deceiving and being deceived;’ since he did not suppose the phylactery and enlarged border on the garment to be merely a social trick.” (The italics and small caps are the author’s, and we hope they assist the reader’s comprehension.) Of Sir Lionel, the model old gentleman, we are told that “the simple ideal of the middle age, apart from its anarchy and decadence, in him most truly seemed to live again, when the ties which knit men together were of heroic cast. The first-born colors of pristine faith and truth engraven on the common soul of man, and blent into the wide arch of brotherhood, where the primæval law of order grew and multiplied each perfect after his kind, and mutually interdependent.” You see clearly, of course, how colors are first engraven on the soul, and then blent into a wide arch, on which arch of colors—apparently a rainbow—the law of order grew and multiplied, each—apparently the arch and the law—perfect after his kind? If, after this, you can possibly want any further aid toward knowing what Sir Lionel was, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that in his soul “the scientific combinations of thought could educe no fuller harmonies of the good and the true than lay in the primæval pulses which floated as an atmosphere around it!” and that, when he was sealing a letter, “Lo! the responsive throb in that good man’s bosom echoed back in simple truth the honest witness of a heart that condemned him not, as his eye, bedewed with love, rested, too, with something of ancestral pride, on the undimmed motto of the family—‘LOIAUTE.’” ...|$|E

40|$|Thirty years ago, a {{physician}} whose patient had diabe-tes and was urine protein dipstick–positive could only say, “You {{will most likely}} progress to end-stage renal disease in 10 years and need dialysis or a kidney trans-plant, {{and there is not}} much <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do about it. ” Fol-lowing the landmark microalbuminuria study of Mo-gensen and Christensen in 1984 (1), clinicians could say to patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, “The good news is, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> now <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> 20 years ahead of time that you will likely progress to end-stage renal disease, but {{the bad news is that}} we still cannot do any-thing about it. ” However, by the early 1990 s, it was shown that treatment of microalbuminuric diabetic patients with ACE inhibitors to control blood pressure, diet modification, and intensive glucose control could slow or prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 3 (2). Microalbumin quickly became a text-book example of a new laboratory test with profound impact on treatment and long-term outcomes of pa-tients with a chronic disease. Since then, the termmicroalbumin has been aban-doned in favor of urine albumin because there is noth-ing “small ” or “low molecular weight ” about the albu-min measured in urine. Urine albumin assays are simply immunoassays capable of measuring albumin concentrations that are more than 3 orders of magni-tude lower than those encountered in serum, which are measured by dye-bindingmethods. Since its first use in patients with diabetes, urine albumin concentration has shown to predict progression to all-cause chronic kidney disease (CKD) and be an independent risk fac-tor for cardiovascular disease (3). Today, numerous clinical practice guidelines exist for the use of urine albumin to predict progression to CKD and cardiovas-cular risk (4). Two of the most cited are the Kidne...|$|R
