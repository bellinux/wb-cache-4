5000|$|In {{the wine}} country, the pair visit Miles' {{favorite}} restaurant, [...] The Hitching Post II, and meet Maya, an attractive, intelligent waitress with whom Miles is casually acquainted. Jack senses that Maya {{is interested in}} Miles, who downplays his friend's intuition, and tells Jack that Maya is married. Jack tells Maya that Miles' manuscript has been accepted for publication, {{even though it is}} only being considered. Later, at a tasting in a local winery, they meet an attractive <b>wine</b> <b>pourer</b> named Stephanie, who is also acquainted with Maya. Jack is immediately attracted to Stephanie and arranges a double date, to include Miles and Maya, and tells Miles that he learned Maya is no longer married ("sans rock", as he describes it). During the date, Miles gets drunk and telephones Vicki, his ex-wife, after learning from Jack earlier that day that she has remarried. They return to Stephanie's home, where Jack and Stephanie immediately adjourn to her bedroom for sex, while Miles and Maya connect through their mutual interest in wine. Miles tells Maya about his book, and Maya says she is finishing a master's degree in horticulture so she can leave serving. They leave separately, but not before he gives her a copy of his manuscript. As the week progresses, Jack's affair with Stephanie continues, {{to the point where he}} believes he's falling in love with her; he bonds with her daughter and makes the suggestion to Miles that they move there for him to be closer to Stephanie. After spending the day together, Miles and Maya return to her apartment and have sex. The next day, Miles lets it slip that Jack is to be married. Disgusted with the dishonesty, Maya dumps Miles and later tells Stephanie who, furious and devastated to learn she's been used, hits Jack repeatedly and breaks his nose using her motorcycle helmet.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, {{sexual slavery}} {{was not only}} central to Ottoman {{practice}} but {{a critical component of}} imperial governance and elite social reproduction. Dhimmi boys taken in the devşirme could also become sexual slaves, though usually they worked in places like bathhouses (hammam) and coffeehouses. They became tellaks (masseurs), köçeks (cross-dressing dancers) or sāqīs (<b>wine</b> <b>pourers)</b> {{for as long as they}} were young and beardless.|$|R
5000|$|Ross Golden Bannon of The Sunday Business Post {{published}} a negative review {{of his and}} his compatriots' [...] "depressing" [...] experience at Dunbrody Country House Hotel and Restaurant in October 2001. He bemoaned the fact that himself and his accomplices had to pour their own wine, implying that a restaurant of this calibre ought to employ <b>wine</b> <b>pourers,</b> and complained that the food was overcooked and too salty.|$|R
50|$|A guang or gong is a {{particular}} shape used in Chinese art for vessels, originally made as Chinese ritual bronzes in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 - c. 1046 BC), and sometimes later in Chinese porcelain. They are a type of ewer which was used for pouring rice wine at ritual banquets, and often deposited as grave goods in high-status burial. Examples of the shape may be described as ewers, ritual <b>wine</b> vessels, <b>wine</b> <b>pourers</b> and similar terms, though all of these terms are also used {{of a number of}} other shapes, especially the smaller tripod jue and the larger zun.|$|R
