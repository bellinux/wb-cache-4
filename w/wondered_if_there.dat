500|$|In the {{recollection}} of author Barry Miles, Revolver resounded with the contemporary London underground, particularly those behind initiatives {{such as the}} UFO Club, {{on the level of}} experimental jazz, and it established rock 'n' roll as [...] "an art form" [...] by signalling [...] "the way forward for all rock musicians who <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was life after teen scream status". He also identifies its [...] "trailblazing" [...] quality as the impetus for Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and for Brian Wilson to complete the Beach Boys' [...] "mini-symphony", [...] "Good Vibrations". Citing composer and producer Virgil Moorefield's book The Producer as Composer, author Jay Hodgson highlights Revolver as representing a [...] "dramatic turning point" [...] in recording history through its dedication to studio exploration over the [...] "performability" [...] of the songs, as this and subsequent Beatles albums reshaped listeners' preconceptions of a pop recording. In his review for Pitchfork, Plagenhoef says that the album not only [...] "redefin what was expected from popular music", but recast the Beatles as [...] "avatars for a transformative cultural movement". MacDonald cites Revolver as a musical statement that helped guide the counterculture towards the 1967 Summer of Love due to the widespread popularity of the Beatles.|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{started the}} {{quarterly}} journal Stray Feathers in 1872. At {{that time the}} only journal for the Indian region that published on ornithology was the [...] "Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal". He had <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was merit {{to start a new}} journal and in that idea was supported by Stoliczka, who was an editor for the Journal of the Asiatic Society: ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the whites}} in the court room likely resented Leibowitz as a Jew from New York hired by the Communists, and for his {{treatment}} of a southern white woman, even a low-class one, as a hostile witness. Some <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was any way he could leave Decatur alive. [...] The National Guard Captain Joe Burelson promised Judge Horton that he would protect Leibowitz and the defendants [...] "as {{long as we have}} a piece of ammunition or a man alive." [...] Once Captain Burelson learned that a group was on their way to [...] "take care of Leibowitz," [...] he raised the drawbridge across the Tennessee River, keeping them out of Decatur.|$|E

2500|$|The Women Under Siege Project {{was begun}} by Gloria Steinem in 2012 {{in order to}} {{document}} violence against women taking place during violent conflicts. The idea was inspired by two books: Sexual Violence Against Jewish Women During the Holocaust by Sonja M. Hedgepeth and Rochelle Saidel and At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance - a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to Black Power by Danielle McGuire. After reading these two books which addressed sexual violence, Steinem <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were {{lessons to be learned}} from both history and current affairs; and also, if information were more widely available and people were aware of the issues, if rape and gender-based violence could be prevented in the future. She has said that [...] "suffering has to be visible and not called inevitable or blamed on the victim before we can stop it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{could be}} a further twist {{where one of the}} five named {{suspects}} is not the culprit, as the BBC said there would be [...] "at least" [...] five. Soaplife added Joey Branning (David Witts) as a wild card, saying, [...] "there hasn't been a good soap toyboy storyline in we can't remember how long. And when they're done and done good, they're very, very good. It would actually be the one affair we'd understand Kat's motivation for." [...] Jacqueline Jossa, who plays Max's daughter Lauren Branning, said that the cast were so [...] "desperate" [...] to know who Kat's lover was that she tricked them into believing it was Peter Andre, saying, [...] "No one at all knows who Kat's having the affair with, we're all talking about it on set. Some people have started winding other people up saying they've been told but they won't say who it is. I started a rumour around the set {{that it would be a}} celebrity guest appearance. I said it would be Peter Andre and some of the new cast believed it as well!" [...] Tony Discipline, who plays Michael's half-brother Tyler Moon, wondered if Kat's lover could actually be a woman. However, Digital Spy reported that episodes in September 2012 would make it [...] "pretty much certain" [...] that Kat's lover is one of the named suspects. After the identity of Kat's lover was revealed, Richie said he would have loved it to have been Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) or Tanya.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Bother!' said Maude, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{were any}} shop near {{where she could}} buy hairpins. As every lady knows, or will know, {{there is a very}} {{intimate}} connection between hairpins and a loving husband.|$|E

60|$|Charlotte {{looked at}} the cat with all her might and main. She loved cats, but cats were not allowed in an orphan asylum, {{although}} Charlotte sometimes <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were no orphan kittens in the world which would be appropriate for such an institution.|$|E
60|$|The {{suggestion}} {{which her}} words implied came to Jimmy {{as a distinct}} shock.

60|$|For {{the three}} Rover boys the Golden Star {{could not make}} the trip from Cedarville to Ithaca fast enough.
