5|$|In July 1822, Edward Williams and Percy Shelley drowned {{when their}} boat sank during a storm while {{returning}} to Lerici from Pisa. Shortly before their deaths, Jane dreamed of floods {{and on one}} occasion thought {{that she had seen}} Shelley's ghost through a window. After hearing of their deaths, Jane and Mary travelled back to Pisa for the funerals of their husbands; Williams and Shelley were cremated on consecutive days in August 1822. After Shelley's cremation, Jane was forced to settle a dispute between Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt over what to do with what they believed was the unburnt heart of Percy Shelley. Though Hunt had initially taken it from Shelley's pyre, Mary insisted that he return it to her. Though Hunt was initially unwilling to do so, Jane later convinced him that it should be returned. Mary Shelley and Jane Williams briefly settled in Albaro, before proceeding to Genoa together. There they separated in September due to Jane's desire to quickly return to England. Jane brought Edward's ashes <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England.|$|E

Then, to our joy, we 'eard {{footsteps}} turn in at the gate. Quick footsteps they was. Somebody turned the handle of the door, and then a face looked in at the window that made me nearly jump out of my boots in surprise. A face that was as white as chalk with temper, and a bonnet cocked over one eye with walking fast. She shook 'er fist at me, and then she shook it at Miss Lamb.|$|R

25|$|In 1957 Roth {{married an}} Icelandic student Sigríður Björnsdóttir, and moved <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Reykjavik. Cut off from centres of European modernism, Roth started {{publishing}} {{a series of}} highly influential artist's books, and to publish these books he founded, with Icelandic poet Einar Bragi, the publishing company forlag ed. In works such as Bok ("Book") 1958, cut holes in the pages and dispensed with the codex, allowing the reader to rearrange the pages in any order they wished, whilst Daily Mirror Book, 1961, used the found material of a newspaper cut into 2cm squares and then rebound as a 150-page book.|$|E

25|$|He {{also spent}} time in Râmnicu Vâlcea (1827), {{where he was a}} teacher at the Orthodox seminary and, in parallel, lectured on {{religious}} music to the nuns of the Dintr-un Lemn Monastery. A scandal erupted after Pann used his position at the latter institution to seduce Anica, the mother superior's 16-year-old niece. Unsuccessfully offering her legal guardians to marry Anica in church, he eloped <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Şchei. While there, he became friends with the writer Ioan Barac, whom he had probably met earlier, and who, according to Pann's own testimony, gave him lessons in meter. According to some sources, he also took a trip to Buda. The literary critic Tudor Vianu attributes to Barac and Vasile Aaron, whose work constituted an adaption of various chanson de geste themes, the merit of having inspired Pann to pursue a literary career.|$|E

500|$|To promote [...] "Express" [...] and Burlesque, Aguilera has {{performed}} the track on two shows. Aguilera performed [...] "Express" [...] {{for the first}} time at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. During an interview with MTV News about the performance, Aguilera stated that the performance would be [...] "fantastic" [...] and would [...] "give a fitting look inside the movie". Wearing a [...] "black spangly bodysuit" [...] with knee-high boots and a bowler, Aguilera seated in a chair <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the audience in the beginning of the show. She began to snap her fingers and leaned into the [...] "jazzy, skittery rhythms" [...] of [...] "Express". Later, the scene revealed a set made up to mimic the backstage at a burlesque club, with the singer surrounded by a number of dancers. Gil Kaufman of MTV News said that the performance is a flash back to the [...] "Dirrty-era" [...] of Aguilera.|$|E

500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E

Sia also performed the song on Late Night with Seth Meyers on 9 June 2014, with Girls star Lena Dunham performing new choreography. In July 2014, Sia performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Ziegler taught host Jimmy Kimmel and his sidekick Guillermo some of the dance moves from the music video.

500|$|On January 26, 2014 {{the couple}} opened the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, {{performing}} the song live {{together for the}} first time. The performance opened with Beyoncé sporting wet-look hair in a leotard and a leather basque, sitting on a chair <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the audience. She conctinued seductively dancing cabaret-style, singing and gyrating on the dark stage surrounded by smoke. Jay-Z appeared to rap his verses dressed in a suit and bow tie. The sexually-charged performance ended with a kiss and the two walked off with their arms around each other. Beyoncé's chair dance received comparisons with scenes from the movie Flashdance, the song's music video and the video for [...] "Partition"; VH1's Emily Exton felt {{that it was one of}} the best chair dances of all time. The duet was described as [...] "scorching" [...] and [...] "chill inducing" [...] with many critics considering the performance to be a show highlight; Lily Harrison of E! added that the pair [...] "set the bar impossibly high". A Rolling Stone editor felt it was [...] "near flawless". Nadeska Alexis writing for MTV News noted that when the singer started singing the first verses of the song, [...] "you could almost taste the aroma of sex appeal in the air". A negative review came from Beverly Beckham of The Boston Globe who felt that the pair failed to showcase love in the lyrics and performance.|$|E
500|$|The centre {{foreground}} shows a {{group of}} five mourners, with three other figures set {{to the right and}} left. In the center group, John the Evangelist supports the Virgin Mary, surrounded by three women. Mary's dramatic swoon in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her [...] "closest to the viewer's presumed position". Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. Mary Magdalene kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner. She is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses. The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying sibyls, and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the Erythraean or the Cumaean sibyl, both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection. She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised, and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.|$|E
