25|$|In {{addition}} to the growing concerns about human health risks from pharmaceutical drugs via environmental exposures, many researchers have speculated {{about the potential for}} inducing an antibiotic resistance. One study found 10 different antibiotics in sewage treatment effluents, surface <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediments.</b> Some microbiologists believe that if antibiotic concentrations are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a species of pathogenic bacteria, a selective pressure would be exerted and, as a result, antibiotic resistance would be selectively promoted. It has also been proven that at even sub-inhibitory concentrations (e.g., one-fourth of the MIC), several antibiotics are able to have an effect on gene expression (e.g., as shown for the modulation of expression of toxin-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus). For reference the MIC of erythromycin that is effective against 90 percent of lab grown Campylobacter bacteria, the most common food-borne pathogen in the United States, is 60ng/mL. One study found that the average concentration of erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was 0.09ng/mL in water treatment plant effluents,. Additionally, transfer of genetic elements among bacteria has been observed under natural conditions in wastewater treatment plants, and selection of resistant bacteria has been documented in sewers receiving wastewaters from pharmaceutical plants. Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria may also remain in sewage sludge and enter the food chain if the sludge is not incinerated but used as fertilizer on agricultural land.|$|E

The results show that, during the period from 1950 to 2010, there was no significant change in the annual <b>water</b> discharge, <b>and</b> the multi-annual mean water discharge increased in dry seasons and decreased in flood seasons. However, the annual <b>sediment</b> discharge <b>and</b> the multi-annual mean sediment discharge in flood and dry seasons took on a decreasing trend, and the intra-annual distribution of <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> discharges tended to be uniform. The evolution process from deposition to erosion occurred at the − 10 m and − 20 m isobaths of the subaqueous delta. The enhanced annual <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> discharges had a silting-up effect on the delta, and the effect of sediment was greater than that of water. Based on data analysis, empirical curves were built to present the relationships between the <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> discharges over a year or in dry and flood seasons and the erosion/deposition rates in typical regions of the subaqueous delta, whose evolution followed the pattern of silting in flood seasons and scouring in dry seasons.
