40|$|The {{purpose of}} your application, which {{includes}} both {{a cover letter}} and resume, is to highlight your skills and accomplishments in an unambiguous and concise manner that grabs the reader’s attention quickly and enables them to clearly see the connection between their needs and your abilities. Formatting your Resume Functional (thematic) resumes focus on accomplishments rather than dates. A functional resume does not often sit well with recruiters. They find this type of resume hard to follow and it raises red flags about gaps in employment. There is {{a time and place}} for a functional resume, but <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> avoid this style at this point in your career. Skills resumes focus on skills rather than where you have worked. Our opinion is that this approach presents the same problems as when using the functional style.
