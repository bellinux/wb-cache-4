5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to <b>watch</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, have you got a single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

500|$|After {{placing the}} album's title track on their website for free downloading, Augie March {{announced}} their first [...] "proper headline tour of their homeland", {{in which they}} would play music from the new album. The album was released in October 2008. <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappears reception was more mixed than that of its predecessors. Patrick Donovan of The Age said, [...] "ou get the feeling that <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear will please more than just their mates and old fans", but Bernard Zuel wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald that it was [...] "an album that no doubt will polarise fans". <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear entered the ARIA Albums Chart at number four.|$|E
500|$|The band, and {{especially}} Richards, are noted for their perfectionism. In a post-Sunset Studies interview with Grok magazine in 2000, Williams criticised the song [...] "The Good Gardener (On How He Fell)", {{to which the}} interviewer noted [...] "the Augie March perfectionism ... a slavish, romantic, almost passionate pursuit". This meme continued throughout Augie March's career; following the release of Moo, You Bloody Choir, Richards {{said he was not}} truly happy with anything he had produced so far. Ammendola agreed, and added that the band considered Moo, You Bloody Choir the weakest of their first three albums, and Sunset Studies the best. Richards later stated that he considered <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear his best album yet. Andrew Murfett wrote in The Age that for Augie March, [...] "creative tension, adverse circumstances and perfectionism seem to go hand in hand". Whereas Augie March's first two albums saw Richards maintain control over production, Moo, You Bloody Choir and <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear [...] "became community projects", and for that reason Richards declared he was not as much a fan of the latter works, though other band members have described the songs on <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear as the band's best yet.|$|E

500|$|Augie March {{worked with}} {{producer}} Joe Chiccarelli, {{who took a}} significant pay cut {{to work on the}} album after declaring an interest in Augie March's music. According to Richards, the production of <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear was a process that contained [...] "a fair bit of friction". Ammendola was critical of Chiccarelli's style of production and the short amount of time spent in the studio. The recording process also took its toll on the relationships in the band. Ammendola has said that [...] "It tore us to bits. It was really really shit, we’re slowly patching up now." ...|$|E

At the Secret Garden Party, in September 2006, Allen made a rendition of the song and afterwards stated: [...] "The festival was well good, particularly as Lester, my ex, who I wrote 'Smile' about, and subsequently sold his story to the papers, had a tent called 'the shit tent' positioned directly opposite the main stage. So he and his new girlfriend had {{no option but to}} <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> perform to a couple of thousand people singing 'Smile' back to me. Oh, it's the little things eh!" ...|$|E
500|$|Keeping in {{line with}} the most {{prominent}} theme of Beyoncé, [...] "Rocket" [...] explores frank female sexuality. It opens with Beyoncé expressing feelings of lust in the first line, [...] "Let me sit this assssss [...] on ya" [...] for which she adopts a soft and sultry vocal style. She further sings about love-making with a male lover and the second line includes the lyrics: [...] "Let me take this off while you <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> / that's my'ass appeal". It features explicit and metaphorical lyrics throughout and sees Beyoncé instructing her love interest to watch her perform a striptease. She further talks about how their evening together is going to proceed with lyrics such as [...] "If you like you can touch it babe, do you wanna touch it baby?".|$|E
500|$|<b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear was Augie March's most {{mainstream}} pop work to date, {{described as}} a further distillation of the band's earlier, even more complex, music. Richards considered it to be more streamlined than their early work, despite their attempts to maintain a sense of spontaneity. Zuel also noted a removal {{of much of the}} backing instrumentation which had acted as [...] "clutter" [...] around Richards' vocals on earlier work. Scott Podmore wrote in the Herald Sun that the album did not have a standout song or an instant appeal but that it was [...] "a slow burner that takes time to get to know you, but once it does, it's a friend for good". Triple J reviewer Jenny Valentish argued that multiple songs from the album could take the place of [...] "One Crowded Hour" [...] as [...] "likely to become wailed for and misquoted at festivals". She noted a [...] "commercial potential" [...] for the album, despite its more disconcerting and confrontational content.|$|E

500|$|Augie March's rise to fame was slow; {{their first}} two EPs failed {{to make an impact}} on the market, despite Waltz being {{nominated}} for two ARIA Awards. Their first album, Sunset Studies, was released in 2000. Despite poor sales, it was critically acclaimed and received an ARIA Award nomination. [...] Critics in both Australia and the United States also lauded its 2002 successor, Strange Bird, but it sold and charted poorly in both countries. Augie March's third album, Moo, You Bloody Choir (2006), received a much better reception in terms of sales; its lead single [...] "One Crowded Hour" [...] attained critical acclaim and appeared on the ARIA Charts at number 29, while the album was nominated for numerous ARIA Awards and won an Australian Music Prize. Having achieved mainstream success, the band toured Australia and the United States regularly through 2006 and 2007. In 2008 they released their fourth album, <b>Watch</b> <b>Me</b> Disappear. [...] It became their most commercially successful album, but received the least favourable critical reception.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{sent his}} résumé and a DVD of {{highlights}} {{of his high}} school basketball career to all of the Ivy League schools; the University of California, Berkeley; and his dream schools, Stanford University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they have to <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> more than once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Rap-Up {{considered}} the video realistic, as [...] "art imitates life". Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic {{called it an}} inaccurate portrayal of domestic violence due to insufficient violence, {{as evidenced by the}} lack of injuries after punching through a wall. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard suggested the video was inspired by the lyric, [...] "Just gonna stand there and <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> burn, but that's alright because I like the way it hurts." [...] Rihanna's appearance was criticized. Writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Daniel Kreps called it [...] "especially striking" [...] and noted her relationship with Brown. An editor from The Boston Globe commented that although the video is realistic, it hinders Rihanna's ability to set an example for women in abusive relationships. Billy Johnson Jr. from Yahoo! Music wrote that Fox's character alternated between vulnerable and confrontational personalities, while Monaghan's character is similar to Eminem. Kahn, who understood why viewers thought Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships influenced the video, asked that they realize this is untrue. He said the team had been conscious of such personal matters and Fox's and Monaghan's characters are only significant to each other.|$|E

500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as a [...] "grinding, fiercely catchy R number". David Balls of Digital Spy gave the song a {{four out of}} five star rating, saying: [...] "'Get Sexy' is a dancefloor stomper that nestles somewhere between 'Boom Boom Pow' and 'Bonkers' in its blend of electropop, techno and R sounds. It may not be massively original, nor an instant classic to rival 'About You Now' or 'Push the Button', but with a Right Said Fred-sampling hook, a thundering chorus and plenty of attitude – most noticeably from Amelle – it returns Sugababes right to the forefront of the pop landscape.' Popjustice positively reviewed [...] "Get Sexy", saying [...] "'Get Sexy' is a punchy, explosive pop single which while not being quite as adventurous as it thinks it could never be described as a pedestrian". Fraser McAlpine of BBC gave the single a mainly negative review, calling it a [...] "mess" [...] which has [...] "not bothered to make it rhyme" [...] in the way the original, 'I'm Too Sexy' did. McAlpine went on to say: [...] "the 'shut up and <b>watch</b> <b>me</b> walk' bit is pilfered from the Ting Tings.|$|E
