Ajtony was a wealthy ruler who owned horses, cattle and sheep, and <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to establish customs offices and guards along the Mureș and tax salt carried to Stephen I of Hungary on the river.|$|E

5|$|This formula <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> {{enough to}} stand {{as the basis for}} all {{subsequent}} descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies on a planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald's {{influence}} {{was less than}} his father's, but Kent <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to be omitted {{from the list of}} kingdoms dominated by Edwin of Northumbria. Edwin's marriage to Eadbald's sister, Æthelburg, established a good relationship between Kent and Northumbria which appears to have continued into Oswald's reign. When Æthelburg fled to Kent on Edwin's death in about 633, she sent her children to Francia for safety, fearing the intrigues of both Eadbald and Oswald. The Kentish royal line made several strong diplomatic marriages over the succeeding years, including the marriage of Eanflæd, Eadbald's niece, to Oswiu, and of Eorcenberht to Seaxburh, daughter of King Anna of East Anglia.|$|E

5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Strez and Boril {{had come to}} peace with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, the ruler of Epirus. In late 1209, Strez and Michael may have {{attempted}} a joint campaign against Thessaloniki, as they both lost lands to the Latins in what was likely a retaliation raid in late 1209 or early 1210. The failure of this attack prompted Michael {{to break away from}} his Bulgarian allies and support the Latins. In early 1211, Strez clashed with the Latins and Epirotes at Thessaloniki and required Boril's assistance after Michael and Henry invaded the western reaches of Strez's realm. In the early summer, the allied Bulgarian army suffered a heavy defeat at Bitola at the hands of Michael, Henry's brother Eustace and Bernard of Katzenellenbogen. Even though it resulted in no territorial losses, it prevented Strez from an expansion to the south. In relation to an anti-Bogomil council in 1211, Strez is referred to as a sebastokrator. The title was either conferred to him by Boril as part of their agreement in 1209, or was awarded to Strez by Kaloyan during his rule. In any case, Boril certainly recognized Strez's right to that appellation. There are signs that Strez divided his possessions into administrative units, each headed by a sebastos. In 1212, Strez <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> enough to be considered one of the Latin Empire's chief adversaries, along with Boril, Michael and Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris, by Henry himself.|$|E

5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb <b>was</b> <b>powerful</b> as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E
