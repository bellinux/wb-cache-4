5|$|As reviewers would note, the {{production}} {{was not without}} its faults. One error occurred with the photographer improperly taking pictures of the mermaid. The developed photographs of the mermaid were also impossible given the distances involved. A more minor error {{in the operation of}} the hotel was given by the office boy <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> arriving guests with remarkable speed. Despite these errors, the company was {{at the forefront of the}} Independent producers and given great praise by Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company in The New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|E
5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} {{in his field}} for {{his work at the}} Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increased}} running time, budget and facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as longer and more intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E

5|$|Maury Gertsman, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> {{cinematography}} {{for nearly}} all Universal Pictures films from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s, worked as director of photography on The Brute Man. Since the film focused on a disfigured serial killer, Gertsman sought to give the movie a dark, diseased look appropriate for the film's subject matter and urban setting. Although primarily a horror thriller film, Gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography, including shadowed lighting, unbalanced compositions, and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and dark. As a result, The Brute Man features a bleak, at times dismal visual atmosphere. Hans J. Salter, who composed the scores {{for many of the}} Universal Pictures films of the 1940s and 1950s, worked as composer for The Brute Man as well. Salter's score for the film strongly resembled the music he composed for the Universal horror films Black Friday (1940) and The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944). Philip Cahn edited The Brute Man. Raymond Kessler and Ralph Slosser worked as dialogue director and assistant director, respectively, while John B. Goodman and Abraham Grossman worked as art directors. Other crew included Russell A. Gausman and Edward R. Robinson as set decorators, Joe Lapis as sound technician, Jack Pierce as make-up director, Carmen Dirigo as hair stylist, and Vera West as gowns supervisor.|$|E
5|$|The {{games have}} been complemented and {{expanded}} upon through other media. For Final Fantasy XIII, a small book {{of short stories}} titled Final Fantasy XIII - Episode Zero was released, first through the game's website {{and then as a}} print release in December 2009. It shows events prior to the game's opening. A second novella, Episode i, was published via XIII-2s official website, bridging the narrative gap between XIII and XIII-2. Alongside XIII-2s Japanese release, a book detailing events not shown or described in the game titled Fragments Before was released in December 2011 including Episode i; this would be followed up by Fragments After, released in June 2012. Only Episode i has received an official English release. Lightning Returns was also set to receive a prequel novel by Benny Matsuyama alongside the game's Japanese release in November 2013, however this was later cancelled due to the author falling ill. A three-part novella exclusive to Famitsu Weekly magazine titled Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories was released across June and July 2014. It was written by Daisuke Watanabe, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> scripts for the XIII games, and takes place immediately after the ending of Lightning Returns. Reminiscence was later released online.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{quaestor}} {{was considered the}} lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} public treasury, (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, the treasury. In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in the treasury. The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> actual accounting for the treasury. The treasury was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E

Aphrodito was not {{under the jurisdiction of}} the pagarch, stationed in Antaeopolis, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> public taxes for the rest of the nome.

25|$|In March 1985, {{after his}} arrest but before his trial, DuMond claimed he was {{attacked}} in his home by two men and castrated. No arrests {{were made in the}} incident.

Whitfield responded that it was possible, and he had noted similar cases of self-mutilation in the past. Fletcher Long, the attorney who prosecuted DuMond for the rape of Ashley Stevens, was skeptical that DuMond could have castrated himself, but he also doubted DuMond's account because {{there was no evidence of}} a struggle, or that he had been tied up (which should have left ligature marks), and there was a two-thirds-empty half-gallon bottle of Jim Beam whiskey at the scene of the supposed assault.|$|E
25|$|While Newcastle upon Tyne {{had been}} an {{important}} local centre since Roman times, and was a major local market town from the Middle Ages, the development of Newcastle and Tyneside is owed to coal mining. Coal was first known to be dug in Tyneside from superficial seams in around 1200, {{but there is some}} evidence from Bede's writings that it may have been dug as early as 800 AD. Coal was dug from local drift mines and bell pits, and although initially only used locally, it was exported from the port of Newcastle from the mid 14th century onwards. Tyneside had a strategic advantage as far as the coal trade was concerned, because collier brigs could be loaded with coal on the Tyne and could sail down the east coast to London. In fact, the burgesses of Newcastle formed a cartel, and were known as the Hostmen. The Hostmen were able gain a monopoly over all of the coal exported from Tyneside, a monopoly which lasted a considerable time. A well-known group of workers on the river were the keelmen <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> <b>the</b> keels, boats that carried the coal from the riverbanks to the waiting colliers.|$|E
