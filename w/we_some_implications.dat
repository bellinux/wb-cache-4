40|$|Abstract. We {{advocate}} {{an approach}} towards the characterisation of components where their qualifications are deduced systematically {{from a small}} set of elementary assumptions. Using the characteristics that we find, <b>we</b> discuss <b>some</b> <b>implications</b> for components of real-time and distributed systems.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{value of}} the Hamiltonian for a system with timelike boundary has been interpreted as a quasilocal energy. This quasilocal energy is not positive definite. However, we derive a "quasilocal dominant energy condition" which is the natural consequence of the local dominant energy condition. <b>We</b> discuss <b>some</b> <b>implications</b> of this quasilocal energy condition.

The running {{behavior of the}} brane action is obtained by shifting the brane-position without changing the background and the fluctuations. After an appropriate renormalization, we obtain an effective, low energy braneworld action, in which the effective 4 d Planck mass is independent of the running-position. <b>We</b> address <b>some</b> <b>implications</b> of this effective action. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary]: We {{propose a}} {{possible}} classification of the conjectures {{that arise in}} the context of mathematical problem solving, and of the different steps taken in the process.
