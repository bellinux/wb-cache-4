5|$|At a {{time when}} non-Brahmins in other parties were {{gradually}} coming over to the Justice Party, being {{fed up with the}} Brahmin's methods and ways of dealing with political questions, it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> short of folly to think of admitting him into the ranks of the Justice Party.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of April 5, 1779, Charles Messier {{recorded}} Pallas on a star chart he used to track {{the path of a}} comet (now known as C/1779 A1 (Bode)) that he observed in the spring of 1779, but apparently assumed it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a star.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E
5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to be gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to {{what was}} to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E

5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a small respite not capitalized {{as much as it}} could have been.|$|E
5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris felt that the NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also {{felt that he was}} defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he learned more about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis felt that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> legitimately offensive.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{insisted that}} there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more {{they could do}} to deter Rhodesia directly; they had already {{threatened}} to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, perseverance, fairness and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.|$|E
5|$|Rachid {{stopped making}} support {{payments}} after paying them twice, {{and to make}} ends meet, Monique returned to nursing. She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends. Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong with the shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.|$|E

5|$|Ryder {{could see}} no ships other than seven or eight burning MLs. He then {{realised}} that the landing places at the Old Mole and {{the entrance to the}} basin had both been recaptured by the Germans. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more they could do for the Commandos, so they headed out to sea. On their way they were continuously illuminated by German searchlights and were hit at least six times by the German guns. Passing ML 270, they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes {{had fought}} bravely. Salzback had {{personally}} dispatched 8 men. But their losses were heavy, over 2,000 {{men had been}} killed, almost half the force while the allies had lost 1,900 men. The defenses at Nyborg was in no condition to withstand a siege. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> for the Swedish to do but to surrender, forcing 5,000 men into captivity; Sweden had suffered a devastating defeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> there to distract him.|$|E

5|$|The bank {{building}} was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it {{and made it}} home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.|$|E
5|$|The bishop's {{violent death}} itself <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> {{exceptional}} and {{could well have}} happened. Many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Linköping in 1220.|$|E
5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> he could do.|$|E
