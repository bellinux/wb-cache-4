5|$|The {{birth of}} the yellow, green, and red tricolor {{occurred}} during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life {{to the idea of}} the tricolor was the French blue, <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flag adopted after the French Revolution. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green and red flag was a green, <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flag used to represent Lithuania Minor.|$|E

5|$|During the uprising, the Sejm {{realized}} {{the need for}} unified national insignia {{that could be used}} by the Polish military. On February 7, 1831 it adopted <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red,</b> the tinctures (colors) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms, as the national cockade of Poland. The white-and-red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising, as well as by participants of the Kraków Uprising of 1846, Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848, and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863–1864. <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule, as well as by people in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause. The Sejm's decision was not, however, immediately accepted by all. Left-wing politicians of the time, such as Joachim Lelewel, continued to regard the revolutionary blue, <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> as true national colors. Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the light}} had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens was {{installed}} in May 1902, just three months into its operation. The light characteristic was a fixed white light with a red flash every 15 seconds. In 1972, the light was automated and the Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern optic. The light continues {{to serve as an}} active aid to navigation. In 1987, a FA-251 was installed before the current lens, a VRB-25 was installed. The current light characteristic is an alternating <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flash every 24 seconds. The <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flashes can be seen for 18 nautical miles and 15 nautical miles, respectably.|$|E
5|$|According to Chapter I, Article 28, {{paragraph}} 2 of the Constitution, {{the national}} colors of Poland are <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> The Coat of Arms Act, Article 4, further specifies that {{the colors are}} <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one is white and the bottom one is red. If the colors are displayed vertically, the white stripe {{is placed on the}} left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as the official shades of both colors expressed as coordinates in the CIE xyY (CIE 1931) color space with the tolerated color differences (ΔE) specified in the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space (CIELUV).|$|E

5|$|Horizontal bicolors of <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> being a {{relatively}} widespread design, {{there are several}} flags that are similar but unrelated to the Polish one. There are two national flags with the red stripe above the white one: those of Indonesia and Monaco. In Poland, many flags based on the national design also feature the national colors.|$|E

Taxis can be hailed from taxi stands or from the streets. Nevertheless, taxis are known to charge high rates for foreigners.|$|E
5|$|Most Polish flags feature <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red,</b> the {{national}} colors of Poland. The national colors, officially adopted in 1831, are of heraldic origin and {{derive from the}} tinctures of the coats of arms of Poland and Lithuania. Additionally, some flags incorporate the white eagle of the Polish coat of arms, while other flags used by the Armed Forces incorporate military eagles, which are variants.|$|E

That same day, Jasta 10 lost its second commander in three days, when Weigand was killed in action.|$|E
5|$|Today, many flags used in Poland {{are based}} on the design of the {{national}} flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal bicolor of <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – a horizontal bicolor of <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – a horizontal tricolor of white, yellow and red with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, the Prussian-dominated North German Confederation {{adopted a}} tricolour of black-white-red as its flag. This flag {{later became the}} flag of the German Empire, formed {{following}} the unification of Germany under the Prussian king who became emperor in 1871, and was used until 1918 {{with the end of the}} First World War. Black, <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> were reintroduced as the German national colours with the establishment of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in 1933, replacing German republican colours with imperial colours until the end of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Deutschland and Admiral Scheer were deployed to the Spanish coast on 23 July 1936 to conduct non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. During the deployment, her gun turrets were painted with large black, <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> bands to aid in identification from the air and indicate her neutral status. Her duties during the deployment included evacuating refugees fleeing from the fighting, protecting German ships carrying supplies for Francisco Franco's Nationalists, and gathering intelligence for the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag of the}} Grand Duchy of Posen, a Polish-populated {{autonomous}} province of the Kingdom of Prussia created in 1815, was a red-and-white horizontal bicolor. Its colors {{were taken from the}} duchy's coat of arms which consisted of the Prussian Black Eagle with an inescutcheon of the Polish White Eagle. With Germany's increasingly anti-Polish policy and a rising identification of <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> as Polish national colors, the red-and-white flag of Posen was replaced in 1886 with a white-black-white horizontal triband. No other part of Poland during the time of Partitions used a flag that would incorporate Polish national colors.|$|E
5|$|The main beaches, codenamed <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Red,</b> lay {{in front}} of Dieppe itself. Making only minor gains, the {{majority}} of the 4th and 6th Brigades became pinned down on the beach, and despite the arrival of an armoured squadron from the Calgary Tank Regiment, casualties were heavy. Reinforcements from the Mont Royals had little effect, and surviving forces were withdrawn by 11:00. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian troops that participated, more than half were killed, wounded or captured.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the white belt is unknown, but {{generally}} presumed {{to have come from}} cross breeding with Lakenvelder (Dutch Belted) cattle. A Polled Herd Book was started in 1852 which registered both Aberdeen-Angus and Galloways. Galloway breeders acquired their own herd book in 1878. The Dun and Belted Galloway Association was formed in Scotland in 1921, and in 1951 the name of the organisation was changed to the Belted Galloway Society and dun cattle were no longer registered. It also keeps and records pedigrees for Belted Galloways and oversees the registration of <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Red</b> Galloways.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home jersey was white {{with black and}} red stripes. The original 'away' jersey was black, with <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> trim. Shoulder patches used a winged 'S' 'established MDCCCXCIV' (1894) logo. The League changed its policies on coloured and white jerseys and the white jersey became the away jersey. The club would use the white jersey with the original logo {{until the end of}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{woodpeckers}} {{varies from}} drab to conspicuous. The colours of many species {{are based on}} olive and brown and some are pied, suggesting a need for camouflage; others are boldly patterned in black, <b>white</b> <b>and</b> <b>red,</b> and many have a crest or tufted feathers on the crown. Woodpeckers tend to be sexually dimorphic, but differences between the sexes are generally small; exceptions to this are Williamson's sapsucker and the orange-backed woodpecker, which differ markedly. The plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from the wrynecks, which have an additional partial moult before breeding.|$|E
