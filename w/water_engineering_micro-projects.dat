40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>{{engineering}}</b> is {{an amalgam}} of engineering (e. g., hydraulics, hydrology, irrigation, ecosystems, environment, water resources) and non-engineering (e. g., social, economic, political) aspects that are needed for planning, designing and managing water systems. These aspects and the associated issues have been {{dealt with in the}} literature using different techniques that are based on different concepts and assumptions. A fundamental question that still remains is: Can we develop a unifying theory for addressing these? The second law of thermodynamics permits us to develop a theory that helps address these in a unified manner. This theory can be referred to as the entropy theory. The thermodynamic entropy theory is analogous to the Shannon entropy or the information theory. Perhaps, the most popular generalization of the Shannon entropy is the Tsallis entropy. The Tsallis entropy has been applied to a wide spectrum of problems in <b>water</b> <b>engineering.</b> This paper provides an overview of Tsallis entropy theory in <b>water</b> <b>engineering.</b> After some basic description of entropy and Tsallis entropy, a review of its applications in <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> is presented, based on three types of problems: (1) problems requiring entropy maximization; (2) problems requiring coupling Tsallis entropy theory with another theory; and (3) problems involving physical relations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND As {{noted in}} a variety of {{professional}} reports, the water industry is currently experiencing a skills shortage due to many career engineers either leaving the profession or reaching retirement age. The question that remains is: What is being done at the tertiary level to fill this shortage? According to the National Committee on <b>Water</b> <b>Engineering</b> (2010), "The education of water engineers should be viewed as a process that initiates undergraduates into <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> and then maintains and nurtures their skills and professionalism throughout the remainder of their career. " That is, tertiary study should be seen as the start of an engineer's learning journey, with industry experience continuing the education process all the way to retirement. PURPOSE To see how much emphasis universities place on <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> education, an examination was performed on the weighting of courses offered in the area of <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> within bachelor of civil engineering programs currently offered at tertiary institutions across Australia. DESIGN/METHOD The courses counted under the heading of 'water engineering' included the well-recognised ones such as fluid mechanics, hydrology and hydraulics, as well as <b>water</b> and wastewater <b>engineering.</b> This did not include courses that may have incorporated an imbedded design component or special topic, due to difficulty in determining the component weighting. It {{is important to note that}} while Engineers Australia does not specify exact course content and structure, it does provide general guidelines, so it is up to the individual institutions to determine exactly what is taught. RESULTS From examining 27 undergraduate programs offered by Australian universities, it is clear they all offer the basic fluid mechanics and hydrology-based courses. Their exact content can vary, but they do aim to address the fundamental knowledge requirements essential to <b>water</b> <b>engineering.</b> Further analysis reveals a significant issue, which is that few, if any, other <b>water</b> or wastewater <b>engineering</b> courses are considered a core requirement. CONCLUSIONS A study of core courses currently undertaken by undergraduate engineering students across Australia reveals they experience only a small degree of exposure to <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> courses. Consequently, upon graduation, they may be unfamiliar with the profession, which could lead to a severe skills shortage in the near future. Therefore, changes to educational programs will need to be considered. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

For the research, questionnaires is distributed to the students to obtain information. Around 36 students from Diploma of Civil Engineering in Politeknik Ungku Omar are involve in this research. This research is to test the context validity, usability and user-friendly of the Water and Waste <b>Water</b> <b>Engineering</b> module which is prepared with the perception from the Diploma of Civil Engineering students in Politeknik Ungku Omar. The obtained data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science 11. 0 for Windows (SPSS 11. 0). From the analyse, the mean score value for each item is between 3. 33 to 5. 00. So, it shows that the module has succeed to obtain the students' interest in studying the Water and Waste <b>Water</b> <b>Engineering</b> subject. Although that, some repair to the module can make it more interesting and effective...|$|R
