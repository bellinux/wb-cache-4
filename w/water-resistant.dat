5|$|Coat: The Labrador Retriever's coat {{should be}} short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is <b>water-resistant,</b> so the dog {{does not get}} cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog {{naturally}} has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and <b>water-resistant</b> pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art {{such as in the}} decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense <b>water-resistant</b> fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, <b>water-resistant</b> cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after {{rainfall}} while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E
5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the reason for}} developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and <b>water-resistant,</b> it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E

25|$|Plywood for {{indoor use}} {{generally}} uses the less expensive urea-formaldehyde glue, which has limited water resistance, while outdoor and marine-grade plywood are designed to withstand moisture, and use a <b>water-resistant</b> phenol-formaldehyde glue to prevent delamination and to retain strength in high humidity.|$|E
25|$|The Aran jumper (Irish: Geansaí Árann) is a {{style of}} jumper that {{takes its name from}} the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. A {{traditional}} Aran Jumper usually is off-white in colour, with cable patterns on the body and sleeves. Originally the jumpers were knitted using unscoured wool that retained its natural oils (lanolin) which made the garments <b>water-resistant</b> and meant they remained wearable even when wet.|$|E
25|$|An amphibious {{helicopter}} is {{a helicopter}} that {{is intended to}} land in and take off from both land and water. Amphibious helicopters are used {{for a variety of}} specialized purposes including air-sea rescue, marine salvage and oceanography, in addition to other tasks that can be accomplished with any non-amphibious helicopter. An amphibious helicopter can be designed with a waterproof or <b>water-resistant</b> hull like a flying boat or it can be fitted with utility floats {{in the same manner as}} a floatplane.|$|E
25|$|Another method {{targeting}} the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried {{in some areas}} of North America and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering praziquantel to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans. Work on schistosomiasis showed that <b>water-resistant</b> topical applications of the common insect repellent DEET prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice. Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{research}} suggests that the Makah people have inhabited the area now known as Neah Bay for more than 3,800 years. The ancient Makah lived in villages, inhabiting large longhouses made from western red cedar. These longhouses had cedar-plank walls. The planks could be tilted or removed to provide ventilation or light. The cedar tree was of great value to the Makah, who also used its bark to make <b>water-resistant</b> clothing and hats. Cedar roots were used in basket making. Whole trees were carved out to make canoes to hunt seals, gray whales and humpback whales.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is <b>water-resistant</b> and slightly wavy, and sheds {{in small amounts}} throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds {{in the spring and}} fall. It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.|$|E
25|$|A {{night vision}} device (NVD), {{also known as}} night optical/observation device (NOD) and night vision goggles (NVG), is an {{optoelectronic}} device that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness. The image may be a conversion to visible light of both visible light and near-infrared, while by convention detection of thermal infrared is denoted thermal imaging. The image produced is typically monochrome, e.g. shades of green. NVDs are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. The term usually refers to a complete unit, including an image intensifier tube, a protective and generally <b>water-resistant</b> housing, and some type of mounting system. Many NVDs also include optical components such as a sacrificial lens, or telescopic lenses or mirrors. An NVD may have an IR illuminator, making it an active as opposed to passive night vision device.|$|E
25|$|During wet or snowy weather, snow {{boots are}} worn {{to keep the}} foot warm and dry. They are {{typically}} made of rubber or other <b>water-resistant</b> material, have multiple layers of insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and {{designed to provide a}} way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.|$|E
25|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers; the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin, waxy, <b>water-resistant</b> outer layer and {{contains}} no chitin, and the layer under it called the procuticle. This is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers, the outer is the exocuticle while the inner is the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and sclerotized. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects, especially the larval stages (e.g., caterpillars). Chemically, chitin is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose. In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient and quite tough. In arthropods, however, it is often modified, becoming embedded in a hardened proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton. In its pure form, it is leathery, but when encrusted in calcium carbonate, it becomes much harder. The difference between the unmodified and modified forms can be seen by comparing the body wall of a caterpillar (unmodified) to a beetle (modified).|$|E
500|$|A {{thermal imaging}} camera (colloquially {{known as a}} TIC) {{is a type of}} thermographic camera used in firefighting. [...] By {{rendering}} infrared radiation as visible light, such cameras allow firefighters to see areas of heat through smoke, darkness, or heat-permeable barriers. Thermal imaging cameras are typically handheld, but may be helmet-mounted. [...] They are constructed using heat- and <b>water-resistant</b> housings, and ruggedized to withstand the hazards of fireground operations.|$|E
500|$|The {{device is}} [...] long and it weighs [...] Muscle and nerve {{stimulation}} {{is provided by}} the device's rubberised, [...] head, which is attached to {{the main body of the}} massager via a flexible neck. A [...] cord is attached to the device to provide power from mains electricity with alternating current, and requires 110 Volts. It does not take batteries. The massager provides two vibration rates5,000 and 6,000rpm, which are equivalent to 83Hz and 100Hzthat are controlled by a switch on its body. Specifically, research published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy determined that the Magic Wand operated on its low setting at a frequency of 89Hz and at 101Hz on its high setting. Its displacement was measured as , with an acceleration of [...] Because the device was not originally designed as a sexual stimulation aid, it exhibits some deficiencies when used for this purpose. Apart from its size, bulk, and its reliance on a mains power supply that limits its portability, it is not waterproof or <b>water-resistant,</b> and it overheats when used for more than 25 minutes. It does not work well in electrical outlets in all countries internationally.|$|E

2500|$|Australian Shepherds have a medium-length, <b>water-resistant</b> coat. With {{the coat}} being {{somewhat}} long and wavy or curly, this breed does shed, {{mostly in the}} spring {{to get rid of}} the winter coat. The shepherd should be brushed weekly to maintain a healthy and clean coat and also to prevent matting. With being a [...] "working dog", this breed should be outside to get its needed exercise. If a dog is dirty, a basic bath can be given, but not frequently, for it can dry out the skin and coat.|$|E
2500|$|Both a {{necessity}} for work and a defining attribute of the breed, the Leonberger has a <b>water-resistant</b> double coat on his body that is complemented by the shorter, fine hair on his muzzle and limbs. The long, profuse, outer coat is durable, relatively straight, lies flat, and fits close. Mature, masculine Leonbergers exhibit a pronounced mane. Similarly, his tail is very well furnished from the tip to the base where it blends harmoniously with the breech's furnishings. Climate permitting, his undercoat is soft and dense. Apart from a [...] of the feet, the Leonberger is presented untrimmed.|$|E
2500|$|Tone {{holes are}} stopped by pads {{constructed}} of fish skin (gold-beater's skin) over felt or silicone rubber on some very low-cost or “ruggedized” flutes. Accurate shimming of pads on professional flutes to ensure pad sealing is very demanding of technician time. In the time-honored method, pads are seated on paper shims sealed with shellac. A recent development is [...] "precision" [...] pads fitted by a factory-trained technician. Student flutes {{are more likely}} to have pads bedded in thicker materials like wax or hot melt glue. Larger-sized closed-hole pads are also held in with screws and washers. Synthetic pads appear more <b>water-resistant</b> but may be susceptible to mechanical failure (cracking).|$|E
2500|$|Marine mammals or sea mammals (imarpigmiutaq sg imarpigmiutaat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, imarpillar in Cup'ig) {{are only}} fin-footed species, such as seals and walruses.

This ice seals (ringed, bearded, spotted, and ribbon seals) are all used for subsistence by coastal Alaska Natives for food, oil, materials, clothing, and handicrafts. Sealskin is ideal for milder, damp weather as the hair provides very little insulation, however, sealskins are wind and <b>water-resistant.</b> Sealskin parkas were the most common type in ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern cloth diapers {{come in a}} host of shapes, {{including}} preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with {{covers and}} pocket or [...] "stuffable" [...] diapers, which consist of a <b>water-resistant</b> outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts. Many design features of modern cloth diapers have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, {{such as the use of}} the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material. Several cloth diaper brands use variations of Procter & Gamble's original 1973 patent use of a double gusset in Pampers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} (or dye-sub printer) is a {{computer}} printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper. [...] The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised CMYK colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print <b>water-resistant.</b> Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{their life}} savings, an 18-foot ship-lap (clinker-built) oak rowboat was built with <b>water-resistant</b> cedar {{sheathing}} {{with a couple}} of watertight flotation compartments and two rowing benches. The boat was fitted with rails to help them right it if capsized, a feature that saved their lives in mid-ocean. The boat was carrying American flags and was named [...] "Fox" [...] in honor of the editor. With a compass, a sextant, a copy of the Nautical Almanac, oilskins and three sets of oars lashed safely in place, they set out from The Battery in New York City June 6, 1896, and arrived 55 days later in the Isles of Scilly off the southwestern tip of the [...] Cornish peninsula [...] of Great Britain.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more <b>water-resistant</b> than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 {{metric tons of}} flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed [...] polyurethane rigid foams {{to be used as}} high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.|$|E
2500|$|When a [...] "reasonable {{picture of}} the {{original}} helmet" [...] was in view, more than nine months of work into the second reconstruction, the repositioned fragments were placed against a [...] "featureless plaster dome." [...] This dome was itself built outwards with [...] "oil-free plasticine" [...] to match the original dimensions of the helmet. The fragments were held in place with [...] "long pins" [...] until a mixture of jute and adhesive was molded {{to the shape of}} the missing areas, and adhered to the fragments. The edges of the fragments were then coated with <b>water-resistant</b> resin, and plaster was spread atop the jute to level and smooth the helmet's surface. The plaster was painted light brown to resemble the colour of the fragments while allowing the fragments themselves to stand out; lines were then drawn to indicate the edges of the panels. The result was a hollow helmet in which the backs of the fragments remain visible. On 2 November 1971, after eighteen months of time and a full year of work by Williams, the second and current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was put on display.|$|E
