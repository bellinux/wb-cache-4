40|$|Background: Pedicle screws {{are being}} used {{commonly}} {{in the treatment of}} various spinal disorders. However, use of pedicle screws in the pediatric population is not routinely recommended because of the risk of complications. The present study was to evaluate the safety of pedicle screws placed in children aged less than 10 years with spinal deformities and to determine the accuracy and complication (early and late) of pedicle screw placement using the postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. Materials and Methods: Thirty one patients (11 males and 20 females) who underwent 261 pedicle screw fixations (177 in thoracic vertebrae and 84 in lumbar vertebrae) for a variety of pediatric spinal deformities at a single institution were included in the study. The average age of patients was 7 years and 10 months. These patients underwent postoperative CT scan which was assessed by two independent observers (spine surgeons) not involved in the treatment. Results: Breach rate was 5. 4 % (14 / 261 screws) for all pedicles. Of the 177 screws placed in the thoracic spine, 13 (7. 3 %) had breached the pedicle, that is 92. 7 % of the screws were accurately placed within pedicles. Seven screws (4 %) had breached the medial pedicle <b>wall,</b> 4 <b>screws</b> (2. 3 %) had breached the lateral pedicle <b>wall</b> and 2 <b>screws</b> (1. 1 %) had breached the superior or inferior pedicle wall respectively. Of the 84 screws placed in the lumbar spine, 83 (98. 8 %) screws were accurately placed within the pedicle. Only 1 screw (1. 2 %) was found to be laterally displaced. In addition, the breach rate was found to be 4. 2 % (11 / 261 screws) with respect to the vertebral bodies. No neurological, vascular or visceral complications were encountered. Conclusions: The accuracy of pedicle screw placement in pedicles and vertebral bodies were 94. 6 % and 95. 8 % respectively and there was no complication related to screw placement noted until the last followup. These results suggest that free-hand pedicle screw fixation can be safely used in patients younger than 10 years to treat a variety of spinal disorders...|$|R

In field measurements, the damping properties of the structure are easily overestimated due to the omnipresent energy losses to the surroundings. Thus, reliable estimates of structural properties cannot be guaranteed.

Totally seven different setups were made using the same building components. In one setup the floor and the <b>walls</b> were <b>screwed</b> together, in five setups different elastomers was positioned between the floor and the walls and in the last setup the floor was resting free on top of the walls. A shaker, with pseudorandom excitation, was used for the excitation of the structure and accelerometers were used for response measurements. The effect of the junction was investigated by studying the acceleration levels in the edge part of the floor-wall junction in different directions. Modal data, extracted from test data using experimental modal analysis, form input and validation data for the following finite element (FE) analysis. Two FE models; modeling one elastomer and the screwed setup, are used for the studies. The aim was to study if the eigenmodes rendering the acceleration levels are similar in test and in analysis, using common material properties. The results from correlation between test and analytical results show that the material properties of the wood need to be known better; more sophisticated models are needed to fully simulate the dynamic behavior of the structure. Anyhow, with the used properties the mode shapes are captured fairly well in the lower frequencies. Furthermore, the experiment shows that the damping properties of the junction material have a major influence on the behavior of the structure...|$|R

In order to ease the surgeon&# 39;s hand-eye coordination and to reduce the iatrogenic radiation injury to the surgeons, a robot assisted percutaneous pedicle screw placement is useful. This study assesses the feasibility and clinical value of robot assisted navigated drilling for pedicle screw placement and the results thus achieved {{formed the basis for}} the development of a new robot for pedicle screw fixation surgery. Materials and Methods: Preoperative computed tomography (CT) of eight bovine lumbar spines (L 1 -L 5) in axial plane were captured for each vertebra, the entry points and trajectories of the screws were preoperatively planned. On the basis of preoperative CT scans and intraoperative fluoroscopy, we aligned the robot drill to the desired entry point and trajectory, as dictated by the surgeon&# 39;s preoperative plan. Eight bovine lumbar spines were inserted 80 K-wires using the spine robot system. The time for system registration and pedicle drilling, fluoroscopy times were measured and recorded. Postoperative CT scans were used to assess the position of the K-wires. Results: Assisted by spine robot system, the average time for system registration was (343. 4 +/- 18. 4) s, the average time for procedure of drilling one pedicle screw trajectory was (89. 5 +/- 6. 1) s, times of fluoroscopy for drilling one pedicle screw were (2. 9 +/- 0. 8) times. Overall, 12 (15. 0 %) of the 80 K-wires violated the pedicle <b>wall.</b> Four <b>screws</b> (5. 0 %) were medial to the pedicle and 8 (10. 5 %) were lateral.

More specifically the objectives of the study were to: (1) evaluate qualitatively the load sharing between OSB and GWB in a wood frame shear wall assembly, (2) analyze the failure progression of GWB and OSB, (3) study the strain profile around fastener on GWB and OSB sides of shear wall, and (4) study the effect of GWB on shear wall behavior. Monotonic tests were conducted on 2440 x 2440 mm walls with 38 x 89 mm Douglas-fir studs 610 mm on center. Two 1220 x 2440 x 11. 1 mm OSB panels were installed and fastened vertically to the frame with Stanley Sheather plus ring shank nails 102 mm and 305 mm on center along panel edges and intermediate studs, respectively. Two 12. 7 mm GWB panels were installed oriented vertically on the face opposite the OSB using standard dry <b>wall</b> <b>screws</b> on some <b>walls.</b> Anchorage to the walls was provided by two 12. 7 mm A 307 anchor bolts installed 305 mm inward on the sill plate from each end of the wall. In addition to these anchor bolts, walls included hold-downs installed at the end studs of the wall and were attached to the foundation with 15. 9 mm Grade 5 anchor bolts making the walls fully anchored. The loading was monotonic and based on ASTM E 564 - 00. Sixteen walls were tested in total, out of which 11 (Type A) were sheathed on both sides with OSB and GWB, while 5 walls were tested without GWB (Type B). Optical measurement equipment based on the principle of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used for data acquisition and analysis. DIC is a full-field, non-contact technique for measurement of displacements and strains. The set up consist of a pair of cameras arranged at an angle to take stereoscopic images of the specimen. The system returns full field 3 D displacement and strain data measured over the visible specimen surfaces. The tests revealed that load is shared by both OSB and GWB initially in a shear wall assembly. GWB fails locally prior to OSB and load shifts to OSB as GWB starts to fail. Beyond this point, load continues to increase and walls finally fail in OSB. The tests also revealed that load path in wall type A and B is different. Failure in wall type A starts at the uplift corner in GWB and then moves to the uplift corner in OSB. Finally the walls fail at middle of top plate for GWB and OSB both. In wall type B the failure is initiated at the uplift corner in OSB followed by middle region at sill level and ends up at middle section of wall where two panels meet. The uplift corner fasteners are of prime importance in both types of wall and panels. Comparing the strain profiles created using DIC, strains only near fasteners are observed and no detectable strain is observed in the field of the panel. There is a steady built up of strain in wall type B from start to failure and there is no abrupt change in strain during entire loading indicating a ductile failure. Wall type B shows more ductile behavior than wall type A because of the lack of ability of GWB to deform at higher load in wall type A where as OSB in wall type B continues to deform at higher load. Also OSB panel in wall type B experiences higher strains than the OSB panel for wall type A for a given load. In wall type A, there is higher strain around the fasteners in GWB than in OSB in the initial part of loading. GWB is stiffer than OSB, it attracts load and in turn deformation is higher than OSB. But being brittle, GWB fails at around 60...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} wall {{conditions}} on the co-rotating parallel twin-screw extrusion of rigid polyvinyl chloride (RPVC) is studied. The relationship between the shear stress at the <b>screw</b> <b>wall</b> and the slip velocity of the flowing melt obeys Navier’s linear law. At zero pressure difference between the entrance and exit of the melting section of twin-screw extruder, the volumetric flow rate and 3 D isothermal flow fields of RPVC are calculated under different wall slip conditions in the metering section of the twin-screw extruder by using the evolution technique in POLYFLOW. The results show that when the slip coefficient is smaller than 10 4 Pa s m ⋅, the volumetric flow rate of the melt is constant, corresponding to the full slip condition. When the slip coefficient is larger than 10 4 Pa s m ⋅, with the slip coefficient decreasing, the volumetric flow rate and viscosity increase, but the gradients of velocity, pressure, and shear rate decrease. The residual stress of the product is thus reduced. Therefore, increasing wall slip {{is good for the}} stability of polymer extrusion and the product quality. The dispersive and the distributive mixing of the twin-screw extruder under full slip and no slip conditions are also studied. Results show that the mixing performance under no-slip condition is better than under full-slip condition, but slip at the wall is good for the extrusion of heat-sensitive materials...|$|R

Two classes of drag coefficient functions are considered, namely those with linear growth near the origin and those with constant or more generally sublinear growth there. A mathematical characterisation of all possible equilibria of these <b>screw</b> <b>wall</b> microstructures is give. We also prove the existence of travelling wave solutions for linear drag coefficient functinos at low wave speeds and rule out the existence of nonconstant bounded travelling wave solutions for sublinear drag coefficients functions.

The governing equation in the static case is not proper and it is shown that no comparison principle holds. The findings indicate a short-range nature of the stress field of the individual dislocation walls, which indicates that the nonlinearity present in the model may have a stabilishing effect. We predict idealised dislocation-free cells of almost arbitrary size interspersed with dipolar dislocation wall microstructures as admissible equilibria of our model, a feature in sharp contrast with predictions of the possible non-monotone equilibria of the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau phase field type gradient flow model...|$|R

Given the reported rate of screw misplacement using open techniques (up to 40 %), we considered it important to analyze possible side effects of this new technique. Placement of 60 pedicle screws in 15 consecutive patients undergoing lumbar or lumbosacral fusion, mainly for spondylolisthesis, were analyzed. Axial, coronal, and sagittal reformatted computer tomography images were examined by three observers. Individual and consensus interpretation was obtained for each screw position. Along with frank penetration, we also looked at cortical encroachment of the pedicular <b>wall</b> by the <b>screw.</b> Thirteen {{percent of the patients}} (2 / 15) had severe frank penetration from the screws, while 80 % of them (12 / 15) had some perforation.

In coronal images the overall screw perforation rate rose to 30 % while the rate of severe frank pedicle penetration remained unchanged. One patient (6. 6 %) suffered S 1 root symptoms due to a frankly medially misplaced screw, requiring re-operation. This study has shown that percutaneous {{insertion of}} cannulated pedicle screws in the lumbar spine is an acceptable procedure.

The purpose of this investigation was to use an anatomic and a clinical study to evaluate a technique for placement of the pedicle screws in the C 7 vertebra using fluoroscopic imaging in only the anteroposterior (A/P) plane. Ten adult cadaver C 7 vertebrae were used to record the pedicle width, inclination and a suitable entry point for placement of pedicle screws. A prospective study of 28 patients undergoing posterior instrumentation of the cervical spine with C 7 pedicle screw placement was also performed. A total of 55 C 7 pedicle screws were placed using imaging only in the A/P plane with screw trajectory values obtained by the anatomic study. Radiographs and CT scans were performed post-operatively. The average posterior pedicle diameter of C 7 vertebra was 9. 5  ±  1. 2  mm in this study. The average middle pedicle diameter was 7. 1  mm and the average anterior pedicle diameter was 9. 2  mm.

40|$|Introduction: Biomechanically {{proximal}} femoral nail (PFN) is {{a better}} choice of implant, still it is associated with screw breakage, cut out of screw through femoral head, Z effect, reverse Z effect, and lateral migration of screws. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the results of augmented PFN in terms of prevention of postoperative complications and failure rates in unstable trochanteric fractures. 				 					Material and methods: We carried out a prospective study of 82 cases with unstable trochanteric femoral fractures from April 2010 to December 2015. Forty-two females and 40 males in the age group between 58 and 81 years were included in this study. There were 45 cases of AO 31 A 2 (2. 2, 2. 3) and 37 cases of AO 31 A 3 (3. 1, 3. 2, 3. 3). Fractures were fixed by PFN with augmentation by an additional screw from trochanter to inferior quadrant of femoral head or cerclage wire to strengthen the lateral trochanteric wall. 				 					Results: The bone healing is observed in all the cases in the mean period of 14. 2 weeks. Nine patients developed complications, including lateral migration of neck screws (n =  5), Z effect (n =  1), infection (n =  2), and breakage of distal interlocking bolt in one case. Removal of screws was required in five cases. Patients were followed up for a mean of 8. 4 months. At the end of follow-up the Salvati and Wilson hip function was 32 (out of 40) in 88 % of patients. 				 					Conclusion: The stabilization of lateral trochanteric <b>wall</b> with additional <b>screw</b> or cerclage wire increases the stability of construct...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} industrialisation {{of the construction}} process in Sweden, the intensity {{and the nature of}} production activities are changing due the application of cost-effective and time-saving industrialised production methods such as off-site prefabrication and on-site assembly. However, the impact of these new production methods on safety and health of the worker has not been methodically investigated and is often assumed to be positive for the construction workplace. In this paper, the workload associated with the assembly/building of inner walls was analysed in terms of workers musculoskeletal system loading. The goal of the study reported here was to identify how the assembling of prefabricated gips walls affects the musculoskeletal system of construction workers. The methods used in the study are the QEC system (Quick Exposure Check for work-related musculoskeletal risks) and ErgoSAM which is a method that identifies situations of high workload and risk for musculoskeletal injury. The results obtained using QEC analysis showed that the inner walls assembly work cycle does entail some physically demanding work tasks, namely the lifting of gips wall elements which was found to have high exposure levels; drilling holes into concrete floors and ceilings and attaching (with <b>screws)</b> <b>wall</b> elements to the concrete floor and ceiling were found to have low exposure levels when these work tasks are not performed at a high pace. ErgoSAM analysis results have indicated at what time of the work cycle, what work posture and work tasks are risky to the workers musculoskeletal system. The use of both methods to analyse the impact of a new industrialised system has a lot of potential in identifying health risks and thus having a basis on which these risks can be planed out in the design of an effective and healthy construction workplace.
