25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, {{the tension in the}} tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E

2500|$|Hay {{published}} a magazine piece entitled Philosophy of laughter {{in which he}} discussed the psychology of comedy. In the essay, he stated [...] "Why does {{every one of us}} laugh at seeing somebody else slapped in the face with a large piece of cold custard pie? Is it because we're all naturally cruel? Or is it because there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be - in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall - we tend to identify with the actors <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching.</b> So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it as been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who hold}} this {{interpretation}} {{argue that this}} aspect of Ozu's work gives it its universality, and helps it transcend the specifically Japanese cultural {{context in which the}} films were created. Bock writes: [...] "The subject matter of the Ozu film is what faces all of us born of man and woman and going on to produce offspring of our own: the family… [...] may be applied to Ozu’s works and create an illusion of peculiar Japaneseness, but in fact behind the words are the problems we all face in a life cycle. They are the struggles of self-definition, of individual freedom, of disappointed expectations, of the impossibility of communication, of separation and loss brought about by the inevitable passages of marriage and death." [...] Bock suggests that Ozu’s wish to portray the life cycle affected his decisions on technical matters, such as the construction and use of the sets of his films. [...] "In employing the set like a curtainless stage Ozu allows for implication of transitoriness in the human condition. Allied with the other aspects of ritual in Ozu's techniques, it reinforces the feeling that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> a representative life cycle." ...|$|E

2500|$|Apart from {{parallel}} cinema, Rekha took {{on other}} increasingly serious, even adventurous roles; she {{was among the}} early actresses to play lead roles in heroine-oriented films, one such film being Khoon Bhari Maang in 1988. She won her second Filmfare Award for her performance in the film. Rekha went on to describe Khoon Bhari Maang as [...] "the first and only film I concentrated and understood all throughout." [...] One critic wrote about her performance in the film, [...] "Rekha as Aarti is just flawless {{and this is one}} of her best performances ever! In the first half as the shy and not so sexy Aarti she is excellent and after the plastic surgery as the model and femme fatale she is excellent too. Some scenes show that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> an actress of a very high calibre here." [...] M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune, while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, remarked that Khoon Bhari Maang was [...] "a crowning glory for Rekha, who rose like a phoenix ... and bedazzled the audience with her daredevilry." [...] Encyclopædia Britannicas Encyclopædia of Hindi Cinema listed her role in the film as one of Hindi cinema's memorable female characters, noting it for changing [...] "the perception of the ever-forgiving wife, turning her into an avenging angel." [...] In a similar list by Screen magazine, the role was included as one of [...] "ten memorable roles that made the Hindi film heroine proud." ...|$|E
