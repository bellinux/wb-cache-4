5|$|Abandoning {{their usual}} {{strategy}} {{of trying to}} make major inroads in Liberal-dominated Quebec, the Tories focused on winning seats in the other provinces. They were successful; though they gained few seats in Quebec, they won 112seats overall to the Liberals' 105. With the remaining seats won by other parties, the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons, but the margin <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> to make John Diefenbaker Canada's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935.|$|E

5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court.

5|$|The {{practice}} of manumission is confirmed to have existed in Chios from the 6th century BC. It probably {{dates back to}} an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure.

5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee concluded that there <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.|$|E

The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and there the matter ended.|$|E

5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> to claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.|$|E

On 8 April 1944, Peterson reported to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and met with Eisenhower, his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2) (Intelligence), Major General John Whiteley, and his Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) (Operations), Major General Harold R.
