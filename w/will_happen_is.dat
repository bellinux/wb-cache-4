25|$|The Ājīvika {{school is}} known for its Niyati ("Fate") {{doctrine}} of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an ātman – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza {{contends that}} [...] "Deus sive Natura" [...] is a being of {{infinitely}} many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His {{account of the}} nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same substance. It is important to note here that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the Ethics, Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests dualism. The universal substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the mind–body problem known as neutral monism. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence in which God can make changes, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that [...] "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,"; he directly challenges a transcendental God which actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> a part of a long chain of cause and effect which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God, or the existence which humans inhabit, allows them to best respond to the world around them.|$|E

60|$|The {{tenacity}} of {{the wonderful}} fallacy that {{the laws of nature}} are agents, instead of being, as they really are, a mere record of experience, upon which we base our interpretations of that which does happen, and our anticipation of that which <b>will</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>is</b> an interesting psychological fact; and would be unintelligible if the tendency of the human mind towards realism were less strong.|$|E
60|$|The {{problem we}} have to discuss is whether there is any reason for believing in what is called 'the {{uniformity}} of nature'. The belief in the uniformity of nature {{is the belief that}} everything that has happened or <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> an instance of some general law to which there are no exceptions. The crude expectations which we have been considering are all subject to exceptions, and therefore liable to disappoint those who entertain them. But science habitually assumes, at least as a working hypothesis, that general rules which have exceptions can be replaced by general rules which have no exceptions. 'Unsupported bodies in air fall' is a general rule to which balloons and aeroplanes are exceptions. But the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, which account for the fact that most bodies fall, also account for the fact that balloons and aeroplanes can rise; thus the laws of motion and the law of gravitation are not subject to these exceptions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Molecular" [...] propositions {{are such}} as contain conjunctions--if, or, and, unless, etc.--and such words are {{the marks of}} a {{molecular}} proposition. Consider such an assertion as, [...] "If it rains, I shall bring my umbrella." [...] This assertion is just as capable of truth or falsehood as the assertion of an atomic proposition, but {{it is obvious that}} either the corresponding fact, or the nature of the correspondence with fact, must be quite different from what it is {{in the case of an}} atomic proposition. Whether it rains, and whether I bring my umbrella, are each severally matters of atomic fact, ascertainable by observation. But the connection of the two involved in saying that if the one happens, then the other <b>will</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>is</b> something radically different from either of the two separately. It does not require for its truth that it should actually rain, or that I should actually bring my umbrella; even if the weather is cloudless, it may still be true that I should have brought my umbrella if the weather had been different. Thus we have here a connection of two propositions, which does not depend upon whether they are to be asserted or denied, but only upon the second being inferable from the first. Such propositions, therefore, have a form which is different from that of any atomic proposition.|$|E

A study in Norway found that the prevalence of PEX of persons aged 50 - 59 was 0.4% while it was 7.9% for persons aged 80 - 89 years. If a person is going to develop PEX, the average age in which this <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> between 69 and 75 years, according to the Norwegian study.
