A twenty-five-day schedule was to be held in Mumbai and Pune, but the shooting got halted in July due to heavy rains.

25|$|In 1946, Henderson formed his own {{orchestra}} {{and signed a}} contract with Capitol Records.

25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

25|$|A drum cadence, {{sometimes}} called a walkbeat or street beat, is usually played when {{the band is}} marching, sometimes alternating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>song,</b> and is typically how a band keeps time while not playing music. Alternatively, a drum click or rim shot may be given on the odd beats to keep the band in step. Between songs and cadences, a roll is usually given to indicate what beat in the measure the band is at. Cadence tempo varies from group to group, but is generally between 112 and 144 beats per minute {{in order to facilitate}} marching.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} {{included a}} complimentary blank cassette with their portable cassette recorders {{in the early}} 1980s. Panasonic's was a C14 and came <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> recorded on side one, and a blank side two. Except for C74 and C100, such non-standard lengths always {{have been hard to}} find, and tend to be more expensive than the more popular lengths. Home taping enthusiasts may have found certain lengths useful for fitting an album neatly on one or both sides of a tape. For instance, the initial maximum playback time of Compact Discs was 74 minutes, explaining the relative popularity of C74 cassettes.|$|E
25|$|Both films occasioned major {{disputes}} between Bogdanovich, who still demanded {{a measure of}} control over his films, and the studios, which controlled the financing and final cut of both films. Mask was released <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> score by Bob Seger against Bogdanovich's wishes (he favored Bruce Springsteen), and Bogdanovich has often complained that the version of Texasville that was released was not the film he had intended. A director's cut of Mask, slightly longer and with Springsteen's songs, was belatedly released on DVD in 2006. A director's cut of Texasville was released on laserdisc, and the theatrical cut was released on DVD by MGM in 2005. Around {{the time of the}} release of Texasville, Bogdanovich also revisited his earliest success, The Last Picture Show, and produced a slightly modified director's cut. Since that time, his recut has been the only available version of the film.|$|E
