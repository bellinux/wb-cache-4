40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the use of interstate inmate {{transfers}} (IITs) by prison wardens and the administrative intent that guide their use. This study assesses the explanatory power of the new penology in three cases and asks three broad questions of two prison wardens and the DOC: <b>What</b> correctional goals <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> to accomplish with interstate inmate transfers? Why? And what contextual factors (if any) are felt to inhibit or facilitate these goals? IITs are controversial. Supporters of IITs argue that in addition to serving the needs of correctional managers, they may also serve to help inmates reenter society, remain physically safe while incarcerated, remain close to family and friends, and have access to appropriate correctional programming and treatment. On the other hand, critics of IITs argue that they are much more than a correctional management tool. Rather, IITs are evidence of an informally emerging 2 ̆ 2 new penology 2 ̆ 2 in American corrections that—due to the increasingly problematic conditions of confinement encountered by correctional managers (e. g., overcrowding) —emphasize a shift in focus away from what is good for the individual inmate to what is good for managing the correctional system as a whole. The case data collected in this research contradict, to a large degree, new penological assumptions. The findings point to high levels of ideological and behavioral autonomy among prison wardens as well as high levels of individualized and moralistic thinking with regard to inmate management, and a general feeling that correctional management at the institutional level is only situationally (rather than perpetually) stressful. Thus, the new penological assumption that criminal justice actors lack human agency or that inmates are thought of only in actuarial terms, may be an incorrect or incomplete assumption in relation to prison wardens and the intent of IITs in these cases. This study concludes that in order to better understand and possibly predict the administrative intent of IITs, an alternative theoretical framework should be utilized—one that better captures the dynamism and variability of influence that unique situational and dispositional factors (and their interaction) may have on administrative intent...|$|R

40|$|Rhodesian land deeds {{in modern}} Zimbabwe Cue: For {{much of the}} last century the Fengu people living north west of Bulawayo had an unusual {{advantage}} over most Africans in Zimbabwe; they held title deeds for their land. These deeds were recognised by successive white settler governments, and helped the Fengu to keep their land when other people were forced to move, in making way for settler farms. How they obtained those deeds is a story that involves {{one of the most famous}} settlers of all, Cecil John Rhodes. Busani Bafana spoke to Michael Ndondo, the current chief of the Fengu, and asked him about their unusual possession of title deeds, and how it was affecting his people during the modern period of land resettlement. IN:		? Well it has been a long ?? OUT:		? ? the government is going to do. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 43 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chief Michael Ndondo on his hopes for the Fengu people in Zimbabwe. Transcript Ndondo	Well it has been a long and bitter battle for the Xhosa people in Zimbabwe. From as early as 1927 the then government of Rhodesia wanted the Xhosa people in Mbembesi to be moved. It was at a time when most African people were being removed from the fertile areas of the country, which were also in the highvelt, moved to low lying areas, with low productivity, and the Xhosa people were asked to leave, but then they resisted. Then they claimed that they had been given this land by Cecil John Rhodes, and what they were claiming was rightfully theirs, because they had been made to leave their own land, to which they had property rights, in the Cape Colony in South Africa. The government then decided to give them plots equal to those which they had left in South Africa. It was then that 177 ten acre plots were demarcated for them. Bafana	We understand the Xhosa people are some of the few in Zimbabwe who have access to title deeds. Could you fill us in on how they came about acquiring these title deeds? Ndondo	Well, in 1938 there was what was known as the Bullock Commission, which carried out a survey on the property rights of the Xhosa people in Zimbabwe. And they claimed the land that they had originally held in the Cape Colony in South Africa. It was then that the Fengu Location Land Distribution Act was put in place, offering 177 plots to those who were entitled to them, and it is the same act by which we still hold those title deeds. Bafana	And how has your ownership of the title deeds benefited you in the way that you are actually using your land today? Ndondo	Well in the first place the ownership of the title deeds has been the cornerstone of our resistance to being moved by successive white settler governments. Because having title to the land, it was legally impossible for them to remove us. Bafana	Today, there is a very big debate about land redistribution, and in fact the government of Zimbabwe has introduced what is called the Fast Track System. How has this affected your people if at all? Ndondo	Well some of the descendants of the title holders, decided to go for resettlement, because there was better land. The rest remained, but the land holding in Mbembesi is communal. People are not necessarily doing their farming activities on those plots to which they claim titles. It has always been a communal set-up. Bafana	And so how do many of them actually use the land? Ndondo	We use the land for both tillage and pastoral farming. Bafana	And looking into the future, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> will actually happen as far as the issue of land management in this area, given that some of the people have moved from their original lands? Ndondo	Well the current land use plan is for a communal type of land use, and we have made a request to government to extinguish those title deeds, so that we live together in a communal set-up. Bafana	And do you think that will happen? Ndondo	Yes I?m positive that is what the government is going to do. End of tape. For {{much of the last}} century the Fengu people living near Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, have held title deeds to their land. In this report the chief of the Fengu explains how the title deeds have helped them, and how his people are responding to the current land redistribution programme in Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|Promoting {{fruit tree}} {{cultivation}} Cue: While the planting {{of trees in}} homesteads and crop land is a traditional practice in many areas, in other places it is a more recent innovation. And even though the benefits of trees on farms are now widely recognised, organisations that aim to spread agroforestry techniques still have to plan their approach carefully. In Botswana, for example, an NGO called the Forestry Association has, since 1983, been working to reverse the destruction of natural woodland. One recent project has been the promotion of fruit trees on homesteads. But getting a ?new? technology like this widely accepted has required the organisation to work through local chiefs and through schools, as well as offering incentives to the farmers themselves. Lesoga Motoma, Executive Director of the Association spoke to Busani Bafana about the work. IN:		?Farmers like to develop. ? OUT:		?. acquired from primary level and secondary level. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 45 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Lesoga Motoma, Executive Director of the Forestry Association of Botswana, was talking to Busani Bafana. Transcript Motoma 	Farmers like to develop but then the question sometimes is the practicability of those methods whether {{they can afford to}} do that. Taking into consideration that the land which they have been given are just small plots, but they would need a larger chunk in its entirety. Unless they come together as communities in woodland management projects - be it agroforestry or anything - but when they come together then they can be able to get larger chunks of land to manage sustainably. Busani	You have talked about the challenge that has faced your Association, in effect promoting a fully fledged agroforestry. But you have recorded some successes in planting indigenous trees even for orchards. Tell us briefly about that. Motoma	I wouldn?t say for orchards, that is a big thing. But the other thing that we have done which is still in the line of agroforestry is the homestead one, where people planted trees in their own homesteads. They would plant three indigenous species, one of which would be a fruit tree and they would plant two exotic species, one of which would be a fruit tree. And in that way, that was the agroforestry of the home, which would also provide shade, it would provide some form of firewood, it would also provide some form of soil fertility. We are encouraging Batswana people to plant the indigenous species so that they can maximise the benefits from them. The benefits mainly being that they don?t have to water them as much, they are frost resistant when they are in their right environment. They can withstand the termites, the poor nutrition of the soil also is OK for them because they sink their roots quite deep. They can also stand the drought because they tap water from quite deep. So that?s basically what we are encouraging the farmers, even at their homes, to do. We are not only limiting ourselves to big farmers; even the upcoming ones in schools we are also targeting and we are encouraging all the facets of agroforestry in the schools, and also targeting the teachers to teach agroforestry as they teach their agriculture curricula. Busani	I notice in the summary of the Association?s performance you indicate that to date we have planted indigenous trees in the 64 villages in approximately 7, 250 households through the Home Tree Planting Programme. How easy has this been to get the involvement of the communities? Motoma	I would say we were successful because we approached it the traditional way. We went through the chiefs and we used the Kotla system. The Kotla system is where the local gathering area that is called by the chief. So that is how we would come in. And people would embrace this around the home tree planting, and then that?s when we would discuss on how best to do it. And that is how we have been successful. Although since people didn?t quite believe so much in indigenous tree planting, at the beginning when they started they would take care more of the exotic species than the indigenous. But because we also had incentives for those who had 100 % or 80 % survival some would just go along so that they get those incentives, which were two grafted citrus fruits. And because they wanted that they would take care of the indigenous species as well. And in that way since the indigenous species would only need that one year to be taken care of, then they would get established and thereafter need not much attention. And that?s how we have managed to succeed. But we lost out on those who were sceptical at the beginning or the laggards who would come after everybody else had gone because by the time they came we had already passed to another village. We wouldn?t go back to the same village the same time. This is one thing that we have learnt that in future we will have to stay in one area for more than a year. Busani	And what does the future hold? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> to do in the future as far as expanding your programmes? Motoma	We still have a lot to do. We {{need to go back to}} communities and get them together because that?s the way to go now. And on agroforestry encourage the inter-cropping of horticulture, trees, both exotic and indigenous because we can?t cast out the exotic trees, there are those ones which are good. We would also like to move aggressively into soil conservation and addressing the energy issue of using fuel wood because now people are cutting live trees for fuel wood and that is very bad for a fragile environment like Botswana. We also would like to continue with the schools - to target primary schools, to target secondary schools so that they grow up with the knowledge of planting trees, of agroforestry and all the interventions of woodland management or environmental management. So that even when they grow up wherever they go to work, whatever career they choose, they would have that basic knowledge in them, having been acquired from primary level and secondary level.
