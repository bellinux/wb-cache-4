Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310nm.|$|R

Orientation: X boolean AND b similar to 12 degrees, Y boolean AND c similar to 15 degrees, Z boolean AND a similar to 15 degrees. Elongation direction is c, dispersion: r > v or r alpha = gamma (yellow). Mossbauer and IR spectra are given. The chemical composition is (EDS mode electron microprobe, Li and Be by ICP-OES, Fe 3 +:Fe 2 + y Mossbauer, H 2 O by TG data, wt%) : Li 2 O 0. 23, BeO 9. 54, CaO 9. 43, SrO 0. 23, BaO 0. 24, MgO 0. 18, MnO 26. 16, FeO 2. 77, Fe 2 O 3 0. 62, Al 2 O 3 0. 14, P 2 O 5 36. 58, SiO 2 0. 42, H 2 O 13. 1, total 99. 64.

The strongest reflection peaks of the powder diffraction pattern [d, angstrom (1, %) (hkl) ] are 9. 575 (53) (010), 5. 998 (100) (0 (1) over bar 1), 4. 848 (26) (021), 3. 192 (44) (210), 3. 003 (14) (0 (2) over bar 2), 2. 803 (38) ((1) over bar 03), 2. 650 (29) ((2) over bar 02), 2. 424 (14) (231). Single-crystal unit-cell parameters are a = 6. 788 (2), b = 9. 972 (3), c = 10. 014 (2) A, (x = 73. 84 (2), beta = 85. 34 (2), gamma = 87. 44 (2) degrees,V = 648. 74 angstrom(3), Z = 1. The space group is P (1) over bar. Crystal structure was refined to R = 0. 0347 with 1273 independent reflections (F > 2 (5). Footemineite is dimorphous with roscherite, and isostructural with atencioite. It is identical with the mineral from Foote mine described as ""triclinic roscherite. "" The name is for the Foote mine, type locality for this and several other minerals...|$|R
