30|$|In the {{original}} study, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests {{were used to}} compare differences in disgustingness ratings in response to disgust stimuli between synchronous and asynchronous conditions. However, these data would also be suitable for analysis using two-way ANOVA to examine disgustingness ratings, with synchronism (synchronous vs asynchronous) and stimulus type (disgust stimulus vs clean tissue) as within-participant factors, provided the assumption of normality was met. According to {{the original}} study, however, the data clearly violated the assumption of normality. For this reason, we sought to compute the interaction effects between synchronism and stimulus type factors using non-parametric methods. However, none of these methods was able to provide an appropriate analysis. Therefore, we compared D-T diff.s in the synchronous and asynchronous conditions with an alternative method, using Wilcoxon signed rank tests to analyze comparisons. In addition, in the original study, <b>the</b> clean tissue <b>control</b> was performed only in the main experiment (not in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> experiment) and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> experiment did not measure disgustingness ratings.

Their promoter methylation profile was also evaluated. Drug-related genes were upregulated. Cisplatin resistance matched with high levels of BRCA 1 and ERCC 1 in both cell lines; docetaxel sensitivity of CAEP cells was associated to levels of TUBB 3 lower than RAL cells. Although CAEP cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine, both cell lines showed high levels of RRM 1.

This study contributes to the research on this issue by exploring one possible {{way of dealing with}} games: How a teacher can integrate the competition component of a math game in the classroom, and how this competition integration influences the students’ motivation and performance. A quasi-experi-mental study was set up, with three conditions in the second grade of Vocational Secondary Education.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{theories}} of reading eye movements claim that reading saccades are programmed {{primarily on the}} basis of information about the length of the upcoming word, determined by low-level visual processes that detect spaces to the right of fixation. Many studies attempted to test this claim by filling spaces between words with various non-space symbols (fillers). This manipulation, however, confounds the effect of inserting extraneous characters into text with the effect of obscuring word boundaries by filling spaces. <b>We</b> performed <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> necessary to unconfound these effects. Skilled readers read continuous stories aloud and silently. Three factors were varied: (i) position of the fillers in the text (at the beginning, the end, or surrounding each word); (ii) {{the presence or absence of}} spaces in the text; and (iii) the effect of the type of filler on word recognition (from greatest effect to least effect: Latin letters, Greek letters, digits and shaded boxes). The effect of fillers on reading depended more on the type of filler than on the presence of spaces. The greater effect the fillers had on word recognition, the more they slowed reading. Surrounding each word with digits or Greek letters slowed reading as much as filling spaces with these symbols. Surrounding each word with randomly chosen letters, while preserving spaces, slowed reading by 44 – 75 %—as much as, or more than, removing spaces from normal text. Removing spaces from text with Latin-letter fillers slowed reading by only 10 – 20 % more. We conclude that fillers in text disrupt reading by affecting word recognition directly, without necessarily affecting the eye movement pattern...|$|R

The process {{was divided into}} two parts, one is reduction process, {{and the other one}} is condensation process. The experimental results revealed that during reduction process, the gas–solid reaction between MgO and CO was not occurred at a temperature and pressure of 1723  K and 30 – 100  Pa respectively. So the main reduction reaction was MgO(s)  + C(s)  = Mg(g)  + CO(g) (under vacuum) and reaction type belonged to solid–solid reaction. In Condensation Process, according to a contrast and analysis, the condensation quality of magnesium is associated with CO concentration. The resultant product C was formed and it followed magnesium vapor condensation which prevents mutual combination of two metal droplets to forms the compact condensation produces. Therefore, in order to compact morphological forms of magnesium crystal whiskers, <b>we</b> must <b>control</b> <b>the</b> technical <b>conditions</b> and find the method to separate the magnesium vapor and carbon monoxide.

30|$|In general terms, {{the process}} of {{production}} of nanoparticles {{can be explained by}} three mechanisms [27 – 30]: the aggregation or attachment of atoms around small clusters (dimers, trimers, etc.); the coagulation of nanoparticles, where two or more nanoparticles get together forming a new twinned nanoparticle; and the coalescence of particles (also called Ostwald ripening), being the latter process that predominates at high temperatures. Competition between these three mechanisms will define the final size and shape distributions of the particles. In our case, <b>we</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>conditions</b> such that the first mechanism—cluster aggregation—is the one that dominates the process. The role of the Ar gas is to produce the erosion of the metal target, such that a large presence of argon into the chamber produces a large erosion of the target. By keeping the gas flow at low values, it is possible to obtain small nanoparticles or clusters. The role of helium in the mixture gas is to keep low the rate of nucleation and attachment of metal atoms: as the amount of helium is increased, the number of collisions between metal clusters and He molecules increases as well, reducing the mean free path of the nanoparticles and preventing their mean size to increase.|$|R

40|$|Here we {{show that}} transport-generated phase {{separation}} at the air-liquid interface in systems containing self-assembling amphiphilic molecules and polymers can be <b>controlled</b> by <b>the</b> relative humidity (RH) of <b>the</b> air. <b>We</b> also show that our observations can be described quantitatively with a theoretical model describing interfacial phase separation in a water gradient that we published previously. These phenomena arises {{from the fact that}} the water chemical potential corresponding to the ambient RH will, in general, not match the water chemical potential in the open aqueous solution. This implies nonequilibrium conditions at the air-water interface, which in turn can have consequences on the molecular organization in this layer. The experimental setup is such that <b>we</b> can <b>control</b> <b>the</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> in RH and thereby verify the predictions from the theoretical model. The polymer-surfactant systems studied here are composed of polyethylenimine (PEI) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB). Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering results show that interfacial phases with hexagonal or lamellar structure form at the interface of dilute polymer-surfactant micellar solutions. From spectroscopic ellipsometry data we conclude that variations in RH can be used to <b>control</b> <b>the</b> growth of micrometer-thick interfacial films and that reducing RH leads to thicker films. For <b>the</b> CTAB-PEI system, <b>we</b> compare <b>the</b> phase behavior of the interfacial phase to the equilibrium bulk phase behavior. The interfacial film resembles the bulk phases formed at high surfactant to polymer ratio and reduced water contents, and this can be used to predict the composition of interfacial phase.

40|$|Abstract Background Forearm surface {{electromyography}} (EMG) {{has been}} in use since the Sixties to feed-forward control active hand prostheses in a more and more refined way. Recent research shows {{that it can be}} used to control even a dexterous polyarticulate hand prosthesis such as Touch Bionics's i-LIMB, as well as a multifingered, multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical hand such as the DLR II. In this paper we extend previous work and investigate the robustness of such fine control possibilities, in two ways: firstly, we conduct an analysis on data obtained from 10 healthy subjects, trying to assess the general applicability of <b>the</b> technique; secondly, <b>we</b> compare <b>the</b> baseline <b>controlled</b> <b>condition</b> (arm relaxed and still on a table) with a "Daily-Life Activity" (DLA) condition in which subjects walk, raise their hands and arms, sit down and stand up, etc., as an experimental proxy of what a patient is supposed to do in real life. We also propose a cross-subject model analysis, i. e., training a model on a subject and testing it on another one. The use of pre-trained models could be useful in shortening the time required by the subject/patient to become proficient in using the hand. Results A standard machine learning technique was able to achieve a real-time grip posture classification rate of about 97 % in the baseline condition and 95 % in the DLA condition; and an average correlation to the target of about 0. 93 (0. 90) while reconstructing the required force. Cross-subject analysis is encouraging although not definitive in its present state. Conclusion Performance figures obtained here are in the same order of magnitude of those obtained in previous work about healthy subjects in <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> and/or amputees, which lets us claim that this technique can be used by reasonably any subject, and in DLA situations. Use of previously trained models is not fully assessed here, but more recent work indicates it is a promising way ahead. </p...|$|R
40|$|I am {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} computer vision. In general my research is about detecting and recognizing objects. My doctoral dissertation is on the topic of face recognition across pose and illumination. The type of methods I apply are at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. Face recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision. There {{has been a lot of}} progress in the case of images taken under <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions.</b> There are many approaches for handling, variation of illumination and expression. There are also several approaches to handling pose variation. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement. When multiple confounding factors occur simultaneously the problem is often termed unconstrained face recognition. Progress in unconstrained face recognition would be important in many applications, for example: surveillance, security, the analysis of personal photos and other domains in which <b>we</b> cannot <b>control</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> under which the images are taken. Existing systems achieve excellent results when images are taken under <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions,</b> so that there is no variation in viewing conditions. Recently, there has been a good deal of work on recognition in the case of variations in viewing conditions that occur over a short period of time, such as variations in pose or lighting. Variations that occur over longer periods of time (such as aging and weight gain) are harder to study. Face recognition across pose is the task of determining whether two faces seen from different viewpoints and perhaps illuminated differently are of the same person. Recognizing faces across pose is important in safety and surveillance applications and also appears frequently in day to day tasks such as personal photo organization. The general direction of my research is in the area of direct image comparison for face recognition. I believe that direct image comparison is a very powerful method for face recognition in unconstrained settings. Summary of Previous and Ongoing Research In this section I will describe the research projects I’ve worked on. Here the projects are organized as independent units, while in reality they are more of a continuum.

30|$|The SKOPE-IT system {{randomly}} assigned each student to an experimental condition with tutoring-enhanced items (experimental) or to a control where ALEKS presented its usual non-interactive solutions (control). Due to two issues, dosage was inconsistent across conditions. First, since ALEKS guided problem selection {{and not all}} problems had dialogs (only 12.5 %), participants in the experimental condition were not expected to receive entirely equal dosage. Second, due to a glitch in authentication, <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> was presented with tutoring for 3 weeks out of the 12 -week course, making <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> effectively a lower-dose treatment.|$|R
