40|$|Abstract:- Lead {{trace element}} was {{analyzed}} in streambed sediment samples collected from 30 {{sites in the}} Veysian River Watershed in Lorestan province, west of Iran. Sites sampled represented agricultural, mining, mixed, urban/rural, and recreation land uses and background conditions. Lead trace element was detected in streambed sediment samples collected at all sites. Because of it's concentrations in the study unit and its toxicity to aquatic biota, lead analyzed as detailed. Lead concentration in streambed sediment was highest at an urban effluent site in the Veysian River <b>Watershed</b> <b>physiographic</b> county. Sites affected by mining, generally exceeded the background concentrations by orders of magnitude for lead. Although natural background concentrations of lead may be high in the mineralized areas where mining occurs, mining land use practices cause increased concentrations of lead. The concentration of lead on streambed sediment generally increases as particle size decreases. Lead concentrations in streambed sediment samples collected from the Veysian River Watershed were compared to concentrations from other study units. More relations were observed between two study units, Veysian River Watershed and Southern Caspian Basin. The highest concentrations for lead in streambed sediment for two study units, Veysian River Watershed and Southern Caspian Basin, were at sites affected by urban activities. Particle size determination of the samples indicated that the mining sites in the Veysian River <b>Watershed</b> <b>physiographic</b> county contained {{a larger percentage of}} silt/clay particles than other sites. Higher percentages of silt/clay particles in combination with mining land use may be a factor for higher concentrations of lead at these sites...|$|E

The curve number method was used to estimate total runoff depths expected from different frequency storms for: (i) the pre-development condition, (ii) a conventional design, (iii) LID design based on the LSA of same building size; and (iv) LID design based on the LSA with reduced building footprints. Post-development runoff depths for the conventional design increased by 55 percent over those for the pre-development condition. Runoff depth for the same building size LSA-LID design was only 26 percent greater than that for the pre-development condition, and 17 % for the design with reduced building sizes. Results suggest that prudent use of LSA may improve prospects and functionality of low-impact development, reduce stormwater flooding volumes and, hence, lower site-development costs. soil survey; runoff; soil hydrologic group; urbanization; suitability analysis...|$|E

40|$|After the {{completion}} of one year of publication of Ambiente e Água - An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science, the following remarks can be made: three issues were published, totaling 18 articles that involved 68 authors; in addition to three editorials. The articles have come from 24 different institutions from Brazil and abroad. Some of those authors published more than one article. Most of the articles were in Portuguese (60 %), others in English (34 %) and in Spanish (6 %). Both environmental and water resource themes appeared equally important as the main topic in nine articles each. Five articles covered both themes, simultaneously. The articles involved local studies (hydrogeology, aquifer recharge) as well as modeling large geographic areas (eight articles) that included the whole Brazilian territory (hydrology modeling), part of the Caribbean region (sea surface temperature and lobster catching), Amazonian Region with four articles (modeling water quality and deforestation), North-Central region of Brazil (conservation areas, burning and deforestation), and the Brazilian Southhern region (soybean yield and climatic modeling and forest modeling). Two articles focused on <b>watersheds</b> (<b>physiographic</b> parameters and modeling). One of the articles dealt with permanent preservation areas (PPA) mapping of a municipal district. Another article developed methodology for image analysis {{that can be used}} for environmental or water studies...|$|R
40|$|Turbidity regimes vary {{dramatically}} among small {{streams in}} north coastal California. In {{an analysis of}} turbidity data from 27 small streams in the region, turbidity at the 10 -percent exceedence level ranged from 3 to 116 formazin nephelometric units (FNU) for the 2005 wet season, translating to 1. 7 to 65 days above an oft-cited biological threshold of 25 FNU. Watersheds draining to the streams spanned disturbance categories from zero (pristine redwood forest) to intense commercial timber harvest. Grouping the sites by average annual timber harvest rate showed that the zero harvest (background) group averaged 13 FNU at the 10 -percent exceedence level, while the low harvest group averaged 20 FNU and the high harvest group averaged 61 FNU, 58 percent and 369 percent, respectively—well above the “ 20 percent above background ” regulatory limit for northern California streams. Regression analyses of turbidity on <b>watershed</b> natural <b>physiographic</b> characteristics and land use histories (timber harvest and roads) showed the rate of recent timber harvest (average annual percent of watershed area) explained {{the greatest amount of}} variability in 10 -percent turbidity exceedence. Drainage area was also significant but was secondary to harvest rate. None of the other watershed variables was found to improve the regression models. Despite much improved best management practices, contemporary timber harvest can trigger serious cumulative watershed effects when too much of a watershed is harvested over too short a time period...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge gaps {{relating}} to water supply, quality, and cycling processes {{have been identified}} as critical obstacles to improved water resource management in recent assessments. One critical gap identified was lack of adequate data to evaluate climate and hydrologic processes, particularly variability associated with climate and hydrology that affects management responses. The USDA, Agricultural Research Service operates long-term research <b>watersheds</b> in major <b>physiographic</b> regions of the US. These watersheds provide under-utilized opportunities to evaluate interactions of land use change, management practices, and climate variability in national assessments. A pilot project is underway to increase accessibility and utility of ARS Watershed Network data for enhanced research programs and to support a wide array of stakeholders. Approaches include: 1) evaluate data management models in other ecological and natural resources research networks, 2) develop formats and standards for metadata and data files, involving researchers, end-users, informatics and data base management specialists and 3) develop a common platform to access the data from multiple locations. The overall objective is to provide improved access to the watershed data for internal and external researchers, while retaining local control of and responsibility for the data.

30|$|Earlier studies {{successfully}} applied conventional {{methods of}} morphometric characterization based on map measurements or field surveys (e.g., Horton 1932, 1945; Strahler 1952, 1954, 1957, 1964); however, {{it has been}} recognized that such methods of generating information especially for large watersheds are expensive, time-consuming, labor intensive and tedious. Recently, increasing availability of remote sensing datasets with improved spatial accuracy, advances in computational power and geographical information system (GIS), enable evaluation of morphometric parameters with ease and better accuracy (Grohmann 2004). On the one hand, remote sensing enables acquisition of synoptic data of large inaccessible areas and is very useful in analyzing drainage morphometry. On the other hand, GIS provides a powerful tool and a flexible environment and as such the information extraction techniques are less time-consuming than ground surveys for morphometric characterization through manipulation and analysis of spatial data. Integrating remote sensing data and GIS tools, therefore, allow automated computation of morphometric parameters and have been successfully employed by several researchers (e.g., Magesh et al. 2011; Thomas et al. 2012; Kaliraj et al. 2014; Banerjee et al. 2015; Roy and Sahu 2016) for generating updated and reliable information to characterize <b>watershed</b> <b>physiographic</b> attributes.|$|E
40|$|Accurate mean areal {{precipitation}} (MAP) {{estimates are}} essential input forcings for hydrologic models. However, {{the selection of}} the most accurate method to estimate MAP can be daunting because there are numerous methods to choose from (e. g., proximate gauge, direct weighted average, surface-fitting, and remotely sensed methods). Multiple methods (n = 19) were used to estimate MAP with precipitation data from 11 distributed monitoring sites, and 4 remotely sensed data sets. Each method was validated against the hydrologic model simulated stream flow using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT was validated using a split-site method and the observed stream flow data from five nested-scale gauging sites in a mixed-land-use watershed of the central USA. Cross-validation results showed the error associated with surface-fitting and remotely sensed methods ranging from − 4. 5 to − 5. 1 %, and − 9. 8 to − 14. 7 %, respectively. Split-site validation results showed the percent bias (PBIAS) values that ranged from − 4. 5 to − 160 %. Second order polynomial functions especially overestimated precipitation and subsequent stream flow simulations (PBIAS = − 160) in the headwaters. The results indicated that using an inverse-distance weighted, linear polynomial interpolation or multiquadric function method to estimate MAP may improve SWAT model simulations. Collectively, the results highlight the importance of spatially distributed observed hydroclimate data for precipitation and subsequent steam flow estimations. The MAP methods demonstrated in the current work can be used to reduce hydrologic model uncertainty caused by <b>watershed</b> <b>physiographic</b> differences...|$|E

40|$|A climate policy {{initiative}} called ‘Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and {{enhancement of}} forest carbon stock {{in developing countries}} (REDD+) is under consideration by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This policy is aimed at national level reduction of forest emissions in developing countries, as measured against an agreed upon national reference emission level. Net emission reductions would be credited and sold to an international fund or carbon market. It was conceived originally as a mechanism to encourage countries with high rates of deforestation, such as Brazil and Indonesia, to curb large scale deforestation due to agricultural expansion and timber extraction. But its potential has also been seen in terms of rewarding indigenous people and local communities for improved management of their forests such that biomass levels remain stable or increase. Since REDD+ is performance-based, the incentive for carbon services provided by such communities will be directly dependent on the annual carbon increment. This paper examines the carbon sequestration potential of community-based forest management in four community forests in Nepal. The four community forests (CFs) selected are from different <b>watersheds</b> in three <b>physiographic</b> regions. Forest carbon pools were measured in two successive years using the standard ground based inventory techniques. The measurements indicate that these CFs (with a total area of 630 ha) had a stock of approximately 478, 000 tonnes CO₂e {{at the end of}} 2009, and through the CF practices, are able to sequester an additional 4700 tCO₂e every year. Furthermore, it assesses different management practices that could affect the carbon sequestration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} {{freshwater}} {{at any point}} on the landscape reflects the combined effects of many processes along water pathways. Human activities on all spatial scales affect both water quality and quantity. Alteration of the landscape and associated vegetation has not only changed the water balance, but typically has altered processes that control water quality. Effects of human activities {{on a small scale}} are relevant to an entire drainage basin. Furthermore, local, regional, and global differences in climate and water flow are considerable, causing varying effects of human activities on land and water quality and quantity, depending on location within a <b>watershed,</b> geology, biology, <b>physiographic</b> characteristics, and climate. These natural characteristics also greatly control human activities, which will, in turn, modify (or affect) the natural composition of water. One of the most important issues for effective resource management is recognition of cyclical and cascading effects of human activities on the water quality and quantity along hydrologic pathways. The degradation of water quality in one part of a watershed can have negative effects on users downstream. Everyone lives downstream of the effects of some human activity. An extremely important factor is that substances added to the atmosphere, land, and water generally have relatively long time scales for removal or clean up. The nature of the substance, including its affinity for adhering to soil and its ability to be transformed, affects the mobility and the time scale for removal of the substance. Policy alone will not solve many of the degradation issues, but a combination of policy, education, scientific knowledge, planning, and enforcement of applicable laws can provide mechanisms for slowing the rate of degradation and provide human and environmental protection. Such an integrated approach is needed to effectively manage land and water resources...|$|R

Indian continental drainage and morphometric features of many river basins and watershed have been studied by conservative methods. Morphometric research is a quantitative technique for analyzing the land surface features. The detailed study of watershed supports and its proper management, allowing the individualization of its characteristics and evolving the best practices for the conservation of the assets that are within its territory (Banerjee et al. 2015; Vieceli et al. 2015). Water management studies are important for protecting the limited water resources, because at most of the places, surface water resources are rare, and at some places, it is totally absent (Sreedevi et al. 2009). <b>Watershed</b> management requires <b>physiographic</b> information, such as watershed slope, configuration of channel network, location of drainage divide, channel length, and geomorphologic parameters viz. relative relief, shape factor, circulatory ratio, bifurcation ratio, and drainage density for watershed prioritization and implementation of soil and water conservation measures (Sreedevi et al. 2013). The present scenario, researchers are used automatic terrain analyses based on an SRTM-DEM for geomorphological research. A more number of current studies are highlighting the importance of SRTM- DEM resolution on terrain, landscape, and soil analysis (Ehsani et al. 2010). The geographical information system (GIS) is helpful to use SRTM-DEM for extracting watershed and its drainage network by automatic methods. These types of techniques are an accurate with both quality and quantitative benefits for evaluating morphometric analysis. According to (Rawat and Mishra 2016), geospatial technology, such as remote sensing, and GIS have proved to be efficient tools and extensively used in micro watershed related studies, and particularly, GIS techniques offer a powerful tool for analysis, management, and extraction of spatial information for better understanding. The present study has focused on Sarabanga watershed of Salem district with an aim to understand the watershed characteristics. The characteristics were demarcated using three types of morphological analysis, such as linear, aerial, and relief aspects. An attempt has been made in this present study to analyze the different morphometric parameters using SRTM-DEM data and GIS techniques.|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} hydrological balance model in a watershed located in northern Tunisia (wadi Sejnane, 378 km 2) in present climate conditions using input variables provided by four regional climate models. A modified version (MBBH) of the lumped and single layer surface model BBH (Bucket with Bottom Hole model, in which pedo-transfer parameters estimated using <b>watershed</b> <b>physiographic</b> characteristics are introduced) is adopted to simulate the water balance components. Only two parameters representing respectively the water retention capacity of the soil and the vegetation resistance to evapotranspiration are calibrated using rainfall-runoff data. The evaluation criterions for the MBBH model calibration are: relative bias, mean square error and the ratio of mean actual evapotranspiration to mean potential evapotranspiration. Daily air temperature, rainfall and runoff observations are available from 1960 to 1984. The period 1960 – 1971 is selected for calibration while the period 1972 – 1984 is chosen for validation. Air temperature and precipitation series are provided by four regional climate models (DMI, ARP, SMH and ICT) from the European program ENSEMBLES, forced by two global climate models (GCM) : ECHAM and ARPEGE. The regional climate model outputs (precipitation and air temperature) are compared to the observations in terms of statistical distribution. The analysis was performed at the seasonal scale for precipitation. We found out that RCM precipitation must be corrected before being introduced as MBBH inputs. Thus, a non-parametric quantile-quantile bias correction method together with a dry day correction is employed. Finally, simulated runoff generated using corrected precipitation from the regional climate model SMH is found the most acceptable by comparison with runoff simulated using observed precipitation data, to reproduce the temporal variability of mean monthly runoff. The SMH model is the most accurate to reproduce the occurrence of dry days but still underestimates them. From the statistical distribution point of view, corrected SMH precipitation data introduced into the MBBH model were not able to reproduce extreme runoff values generated by observed precipitation data during validation (larger than 80 mm/month). This {{may be due to the}} SMH weakness in reproducing moderate and high rainfall levels even after bias correction. This approach may be considered as a way to use regional climate models (RCM) model outputs for studying hydrological impacts...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Watershed Management, 2011 Erosion and {{sedimentation}} {{related to}} roads in mountainous areas {{have long been}} a concern for land managers and those charged with protecting soil, water and streams. Erosion in the Mill and Luffenholtz Creek watersheds in Humboldt County, California, with their extensive clay soils, can lead to high turbidity levels in receiving bodies of water. These eroded clays, once suspended in flowing water, can increase the costs of treating water for domestic water supplies. Furthermore a health hazard can result from the creation of disinfection bi-products, such as chloro-tri-halomethanes. Reasons for studying turbidity in these creeks included {{the use of these}} creeks for domestic water supplies for the City of Trinidad and the surrounding area and the presence of endangered species of fish. In addition the receiving waters of Trinidad Bay have been designated an Area of Special Biological Significance (ASBS), as well as a Critical Coastal Area (CCA). Local residents were interested in identifying sediment sources and implementing practices to remedy these problem areas. Detailed road and erosion surveys and monitoring of suspended sediment, discharge, and turbidity levels in Mill Creek (3. 11 kilometers??) and Luffenholtz Creek (12. 95 kilometers??) were completed to determine the sources of turbidity. Two continuous turbidity and stage monitoring stations in lower Mill and Luffenholtz Creeks were maintained along with six additional grab sample locations. <b>Watershed</b> <b>physiographic</b> and land use characteristics were compared for those basin areas upstream from the eight monitoring sites and a statistical analysis was completed to determine whether significant differences existed between turbidity levels in the watersheds. The Luffenholtz Creek watershed, particularly Grassy and 18 Creeks, and the main stem of Luffenholtz, just downstream of the 21 Rock Quarry, were the sub-watershed areas with the highest turbidities. They were also the sub-watershed areas with the highest density of roads, the most miles of roads adjacent to streams, and the highest concentration of identified erosion prone sites. Statistical analysis showed that Luffenholtz Creek was significantly more turbid than Mill Creek, and the site downstream of the 21 Rock Quarry was significantly more turbid than the site upstream of the 21 Quarry. Total instantaneous loads for a three-storm period (5 / 1 - 5 / 4, 5 / 4 - 5 / 9, and 5 / 13 - 5 / 17 / 2009) representing three of eight major storms for the year, were approximately 0. 016 metric tons per kilometer?? for Luffenholtz Creek and 0. 0006 metric tons per kilometer?? for Mill Creek. Although Mill Creek was the watershed with the highest rate of timber harvesting over the past ten years, the steepest stream profile, and a history of more extensive fires, its turbidities were nearly always lower than Luffenholtz Creek. The most likely explanation for increased turbidities in Luffenholtz was the greater road density and road proximities, as well as a legacy of stored sediments in the bankfull channel area from past harvest activities. The sediment was most likely coming from roads and stored sediments. Cooperative efforts are now underway with the local watershed council, local contractors, and local landowners to resolve these correctable erosion problems in both watersheds...|$|E
40|$|Selection of a rainfall-runoff {{model is}} a compromisebetween model {{complexity}} and available inputdata. While more complex models should betterrepresent the physical processes, the assumption that they lead to more reliable results has been questioned (Loague and Freeze, 1985). They have shown that simpler, less data-intensive models provided as good or better simulations than physically based models. An empirical {{model is a}} representation of data and has no real theoretical basis. A physically based model {{is one that has}} a theoretical basis and whose parameters and variables are measurable in the field (Beven, 1983). In reality, many empirical relationships are used for parameter estimation by the “physically based ” models (Wilcox et al., 1990). The SCS runoff equation is basically an empirical model which came into common use in the 1950 s. It is the product of more than 20 years of studies involving rainfall runoff relationships from small rural watersheds. The model was developed to provide a consistent basis for estimating the amounts of runoff under varying land use and soil types (Rallison and Miller, 1981). No other rainfall-runoff model has been used as successfully or as often on ungaged rangeland catchments as the CN (Graf, 1988). A major limitation of the curve number method is that rainfall intensity and duration are not considered, only total rainfall volume. Time-based physical models such as Green-Ampt are thought to better mimic the impacts of land use on runoff, because infiltration parameters can be directly related to catchment characteristics (Wilcox et al., 1990). However, such models require disaggregated daily precipitation data which are difficult to obtain. Even though the Green-Ampt equation has a physical basis, much may be lost or diluted by the regression equations needed to parameterize the model (Wilcox et al., 1990). In a study of 585 storm events on 36 <b>watersheds</b> in six <b>physiographic</b> provinces of the Central and Eastern U. S., Bales and Betson (1981) concluded that the curve number appears to be a good numeric index of land use and is potentially a useful basin characteristic for use in hydrologic model regionalization.

30|$|Relief {{characteristics}} {{can help}} understand landforms of a watershed, drainage networks development, overland flow, and erosional properties of terrain. In the present study, relief ratio (R h), relative relief (R hp), ruggedness number (R n), and dissection index (D is) {{were used as}} these parameters reveal the runoff and erosion potential of a watershed. The total relief of Agula watershed is 907  m (Table  1). Such a high value indicated the high potential erosive energy of the watershed above a specified datum available to move water and sediment down the slope. The relief characteristic values of R h (0.02), R hp (0.48), R n (2.36), and D is (0.31) (Table  1) indicated that Agula watershed is characterized by high relief, steep slopes and is moderately dissected. For the sub-watersheds, the Rh value ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 with low values in sub-watersheds under cluster C 1 and high values in sub-watersheds under cluster C 3 (Fig.  3 d; Table  3). In a similar study, Kaliraj et al. (2014) attributed the low value of Rh mainly to resistant basement rocks and low degree of slope. Thomas et al. (2012) considered relatively high Rh values as indicative of comparatively steeply sloping terrain and consequently higher basin energy manifested as high intensity of erosion processes operating along the hillslopes as well as sediment transport capacity. As such, runoff is generally faster in sub-watershed with high R h producing more peaked discharges and hence greater erosive power. For the sub-watersheds of Agula, the R n and D is values ranged from 0.41 – 1.63 to 0.07 – 0.22, respectively. Similar to the R h, high values of R n and D is were found in sub-watersheds under cluster C 3, whereas sub-watersheds under cluster C 1 registered low R n and D is values (Fig.  3 d; Table  3). The high R n and D is values indicated the presence of long and steep slopes and high degree of dissection which implied lower time of concentration of overland flow and possibilities of flash floods and high susceptibility to soil erosion than watersheds with low R n and D is. A study by Patton and Baker (1976) demonstrated that watersheds with high flash flood potential have greater R n than low potential <b>watersheds</b> in several <b>physiographic</b> regions of the United States. Further, R h, R n, and D is bear statistically significant (p <  0.05) positive correlations (Table  4).|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} fire history reconstructed from select coast redwood {{stands in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, California based on the fire scar record in specimens collected between 2008 and 2013. The research is one component of a larger multidisciplinary examination of indigenous burning practices in the Central California Coast region (Lightfoot et al. 2013). Research presented herein exhibits concordance with results from related studies, including analyses of soil phytolith content (Evett and Cuthrell 2013), faunal assemblages (Gifford-Gonzalez et al. 2013), and microscopic pollen and charcoal evidence (Cowart and Byrne 2013). Fire history research was conducted in three coastal watersheds in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, California using standard dendroecological techniques, {{as well as a}} novel statistical approach developed to address undated, floating chronologies. A total of 103 coast redwood samples were collected from 95 sample trees in 19 plots within the study area. The fire return intervals recorded from the dated redwood samples in this study were relatively frequent. Fire information was estimated for three focal management eras: the native and ranching eras (1600 - 1850), intensive commercial logging (1850 - 1950), and the modern fire suppression/sustainable harvest era (1950 - 2013). Results from dated fire scars indicate that fires were less frequent in the native and ranching period (mean FRI 7. 6 years; range 1 - 29) than the intensive logging period (mean FRI 3. 1 years; range 1 - 11), as well as the modern period (mean FRI 4. 6 years; range 1 - 12). However, use of a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) on undated, floating chronologies indicated that the probability of fire may have been quite high in the earlier period, and that three independent variables were significant predictors in assessing the annual probability of the occurrence of fire in the study area: physiographic zone; position on slope; and linear distance to pre-colonial, native habitation sites. The GLMM also indicates that fire probabilities are not distributed uniformly in study watersheds. Trees located in close proximity to native residential sites had a high probability of being burned than those farther away (42 - 69 % vs. 17 - 38 %). Similarly, top of slope fire were more likely in all <b>watersheds</b> and <b>physiographic</b> zones, though varying in degree. The season of fire occurrence was determined for 85 % of the fire scars. Dormant or late season fires accounted for a combined total of 87 % of all fires for the entire period of record (1350 - 2013; 55 % dormant, 33 % late) - indicating that historic fires most likely took place between approximately mid-August to late March. Early season (approx. April to August) fires accounted for 13 % of fires. In the 1600 - 1850 period, combined dormant and late season fires accounted for 91 % of fires (64 % and 27 %, respectively), with 9 % of fires occurring in the early season. During the intensive logging period (1850 - 1950) combined dormant and late season fires accounted for 85 % of fires, and 15 % in the early season. In the modern era (1950 - 2013), dormant and late season fires still account for the majority of fires (86 %), but with a marked shift into the drier late season (mid-August - September), which now account for 43 % of fires. Early season fires represent 14 % of fires in this period. Though this study faced significant challenges (i. e. low sample density for earlier period specimens, large study area, experimental use of a GLMM), these data reveal interesting and potentially useful patterns of historic fire occurrence in the Santa Cruz Mountains, especially with respect to human influence over coastal fire regimes. All sources of information indicate that coastal Santa Cruz Mountains experienced far more ignitions than would be expected under a lightning-driven fire regime (roughly 4 strikes per century), and that human activity is strongly linked to fire frequency in throughout observable time periods. There is ample opportunity to improve on this data with future work in efforts to inform and refine modern approaches to resource management in this region...|$|R
