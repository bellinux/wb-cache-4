5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves <b>with</b> <b>being</b> a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated <b>with</b> <b>being</b> a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E
