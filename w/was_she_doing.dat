60|$|What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> She {{was looking}} fixedly {{into one of}} the corners of the room.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{gradually}} the heaviness {{of her heart}} pressed and pressed into consciousness. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> Was she bearing a child? Bearing a child? To what? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes!" [...] she cried. [...] "Of course, I {{remember}} all about it. The young lady {{who was with}} you--what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there? Where is she now?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2009 Writers' Guild Award for Best Book ( [...] What <b>is</b> <b>She</b> <b>Doing</b> Here) ...|$|R
60|$|Had it not <b>been</b> that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not dare}} {{to do that}} for the son which she had refused to the mother, I think that she would have given way. As it <b>was,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know how to yield, after having persevered so long.|$|R
6000|$|Ant. What {{manner of}} woman <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> not want {{two of the}} four elements? has she any thing about her but air and fire? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leslie {{seemed very}} quiet tonight, didn't she?" [...] said Gilbert, {{when he and}} Anne reached home. [...] "What in the world <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> over there on the bar alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Handsome and young!" [...] The judge's eyes {{took on a}} musing expression. [...] "Well, well! that {{accounts}} for much. But what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{up there in the}} company of that old Dutchman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'He's {{been missing}} all the evening,' ses the cook, wot was {{standing}} beside me. 'If he'd been doing 'is dooty, the pore gal wouldn't 'ave been drownded. Wot <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> on the wharf?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, may <b>be</b> <b>she's</b> <b>doing</b> {{it because}} <b>she</b> hates you--doing {{it for her}} soul's good--sort of penance, sort of atonement to Mavering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell. I {{only know}} I have a horror of her, a sudden {{shrinking}} whenever {{her name is}} mentioned. Who <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> <b>do</b> you suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not as I do! To {{say that}} is nonsense, Bell; of course <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not love him as I do. But the truth <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not love him at all. Do you think I cannot see it?" ...|$|R
60|$|As to Grace, in {{the first}} place. What injury <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{to a woman who}} was dead? The {{question}} answered itself. No injury to the woman. No injury to her relations. Her relations were dead also.|$|E
6000|$|Something I {{had been}} dimly {{conscious}} {{of at the}} back of my brain came forward and stood before me: the flabby figure of Miss Rosina Sellars. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here? What right had she to step between me and my regeneration? ...|$|E
60|$|But {{who was she}} {{to affirm}} it? And what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> with {{unsatisfied}} desires? She was ashamed. She ignored them and left them out of count as much as possible, her underneath yearnings. They angered her. She {{wanted to be like}} other people, decently satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I shouldn't {{know what}} to say, either," [...] replied Janet. She smiled, but she had an odd desire to cry. [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly {{heard what}} it <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> say," [...] said Harold Smith; [...] "so I could not answer her, you know. Something about Sundays, I believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, do tell {{us about}} her. Who <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> perform for a living? What kind of a person are we to expect?" [...] volleyed Miss Brush.|$|R
6000|$|To-morrow {{there would}} be several hundred dollars more, {{and the next day}} more, and so on always, and what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing,</b> or what had she planned to do, to give proper {{direction}} to these tidal waves of wealth? She had bought a new dish-pan and ordered a door repaired! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have hit}} it!" [...] cried Miserrimus Dexter. [...] "You are a {{wonderful}} woman! What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{on the morning}} of the day when Mrs. Eustace Macallan died poisoned? And where was she during the dark hours of the night? I can tell you where she was not--she was not in her own room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] Hendricks demanded. [...] "What are {{you looking}} for? Is {{something}} coming?" [...] He shook his head, trying to understand. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> What was she waiting for? He could see nothing. Ash lay all around them, ash and ruins. Occasional stark tree trunks, without leaves or branches. [...] "What--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah {{there it}} <b>is.</b> <b>She</b> <b>does</b> care. But it isn't, is it," [...] Miss Barrace considerately added, [...] "as {{if you had}} ever had any doubt of that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He saw Valentine's smile, {{and broke}} off abruptly. [...] "Anyway, it doesn't {{matter in the}} least to either of us. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here, and who are the others?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes... Dear me! Arabella not in {{the depths}} of London, but down here! It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there?" ...|$|R
60|$|Why did she not speak? What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> If she had but {{uttered a}} single word of protest, of angry dismissal, Paul would have flown to her side. It could not be the {{paralysis}} of personal fear: the balcony was wide; she could easily pass to the end; she could even see his open window.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} queer. Old Granny Fox {{sat down to}} think who would dare steal {{anything}} from her. Then she walked in a big circle with her nose to the ground, sniffing and sniffing. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> that for? Why, {{to see if she}} could find the tracks of anyone who might have stolen her chicken.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, you see, {{this woman}} was {{undoubtedly}} in that house {{on the night of}} the fire. She escaped, and in a mighty hurry too, for she had not time to change her slippers for shoes; she escaped on horseback, for that is how she lost them. Now what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there with those rascals, for the face I saw looked as innocent as a saint's." ...|$|E
500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows that I {{have a sense of humor}} and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> that? Why <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> the treadmill with her high heels on?" [...] I'm like, [...] "It's a freakin' joke! It's 'Cribs'! Hello! It's a freakin' joke!" ...|$|R
50|$|Allen is a non-lineage {{micaceous}} pottery artist, that <b>is,</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not come}} {{from a long line}} of Jicarilla Apache potters. Nonetheless <b>she</b> <b>is</b> interested in sustaining this tradition for the next generation of Jicarilla Apaches.|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>is,</b> I swear <b>she</b> <b>is!</b> <b>She's</b> <b>doing</b> it again! <b>She's</b> {{stopping}} the carriage. Oh, {{go out and}} see what she wants! Don't {{you know that a}} queen's wish is a command? You've got to go!" ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> now, he wondered, as he {{addressed}} the envelope to his wife. He could not control the telephone. He could not play the spy. She might be making any arrangements she chose. Yet the thought did not disturb him {{so much as the}} strange, unpleasant, illicit atmosphere of the whole scene with the young people the night before. His sense of discomfort was almost physical.|$|E
60|$|As to Lady Janet, in {{the second}} place. If she served her new {{mistress}} faithfully, if she filled her new sphere honorably, if she was diligent under instruction and grateful for kindness--if, in one word, she was all {{that she might be}} and would be in the heavenly peace and security of that new life--what injury <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> to Lady Janet? Once more the question answered itself. She might, and would, give Lady Janet cause to bless the day when she first entered the house.|$|E
60|$|She {{called out}} to him what she had come for, and he {{called out to}} her what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there; but of course neither of them {{understood}} the other's language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this was such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you know}} the girl? What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> now?" [...] asked Miss Ellery, who had lost {{a part of the}} story as she sat in a shadowy nook with the pensive Fred.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in society," [...] responded Mrs. Brimmer, with a sigh, [...] "and I do not {{remember}} to have met the lady before. The fact <b>is,</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not move in our circle--in the upper classes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing very much," [...] {{answered}} Dick, before {{either of}} his brothers could speak. [...] "A girl saw a man leaving the building {{the evening of the}} robbery, but who he <b>was,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know." ...|$|R
