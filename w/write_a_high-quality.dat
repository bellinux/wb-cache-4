This article summarizes some pivotal information on how to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> dissertation literature review. It begins with a discussion of the purposes of a review, presents taxonomy of literature reviews, and then discusses the steps in conducting a quantitative or qualitative literature review. The article concludes with a discussion of common mistakes and a framework for the self-evaluation of a literature review...|$|E

This paper introduces the basic-element theory of extenics into the academic research training of conducting social surveys. Through matter-element analysis, affair-element analysis, and relation element analysis, this paper aims at helping “green hand” college students to fit into their roles and conduct research...|$|E
40|$|The {{essay is}} a {{well-established}} format of communicating {{knowledge and understanding}} about a topic in a logical, credible, and persuasive way, within a given timeframe and word limit. That said, there is often very little time in university courses allocated to teaching effective essay-writing skills. While {{there is no single}} best way to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> essay, {{there are a number of}} rules that need to be followed. The secret to getting great marks for your essay is to learn the rules of the essay-writing game and adopt a systematic approach - there is no magical way to 'beat the system' by avoiding the necessary hard work. That said, this chapter provides some handy tips on how to plan, research, write, and reference a sociology essay, all of which should save you time and improve your performance. 3 r...|$|E
40|$|Performance tuning {{improves}} a compiler's {{performance by}} detecting errors and missed opportunities in its analysis, optimization, and code generation stages. Normally, a compiler's author tunes it {{by examining the}} generated code to nd suboptimal code sequences. This paper describes a collection of tools, called compiler auditors, that assist a compiler writer by partially mechanizing the process of nding suboptimal code sequences. Although these code sequences do not always exhibit compiler bugs, they frequently illustrate problems in a compiler. Experiments show that auditors e ectively nd suboptimal code, even in <b>a</b> <b>high-quality,</b> commercial compiler. After <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> compiler, its authors improve it with the time-consuming and tedious process of examining generated assembly code to nd ine cient code sequences that could run faster or consume less space. These sequences direct a compiler writer's attention to places in the compiler at which improved analysis, optimization, or code generation would result in better code. Typically a compiler writer nds this suboptimal code by reading assembly-language listings of compiled code (see, for example Briggs [6]). Performance tuning of this sort is unavoidabl...|$|R

40|$|We {{designed}} a paper assignment for introductory psychology that used progressive writing techniques to discuss course material as il-lustrated in popular movies. We provided {{students with a}} written tutorial that explained a 6 -step writing process and provided feed-back on their progress at each step. Course evaluations indicated that students liked the assignment and believed that the progressive writing approach helped them <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> paper. Although student motivation was lower than expected, paper performance was high with 44 % of students earning more than 90 % of the avail-able points. Although writing assignments are a common feature of in-troductory psychology, most students in such courses are freshmen and are unfamiliar with how to write college papers. The ambiguity of the writing process may produce anxiety that can attenuate performance. In addition, instructors sel-dom give students complete control over selection of their paper topics. For example, students may have to read a novel and write a paper discussing psychological concepts found in that novel. Because the instructor typically selects the books before the semester begins, those chosen may not meet {{the interests of the}} students and consequently fail to spark their motivation for writing a paper. Webelieve theambiguityof thewritingprocessandthe lack of control inherent in traditional paper assignments produces low motivation. Low motivation may result in many students completing a paper the night before it is due. As a result, stu-dents may not adequately process and reflect on what they learned, resulting ina lessbeneficialeducationalexperience. One way to address these issues is through the use of pro-gressive writing techniques focused on popular movies. Past research has demonstrated that progressive writing (i. e., writ-ing one section of a paper at a time, providing feedback on each section, and allowing students to rewrite each section) improves writing quality and motivation (e. g., Dorazio, 1984...|$|E
