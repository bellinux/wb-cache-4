25|$|The above effects often {{combine to}} cause {{non-linear}} effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption {{refers to the}} inability of a capacitor that has been charged {{for a long time}} to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors <b>will</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called soakage or battery action. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15–25% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors.|$|E

25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire <b>will</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).|$|E
25|$|The local {{environment}} and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees <b>will</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California redwood water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) {{were part of a}} self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.|$|E
25|$|A newborn's {{shell size}} {{depends on the}} egg size since the shell {{develops}} from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell <b>will</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; {{there will be no}} further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.|$|E

25|$|Predictive and presymptomatic testing: Predictive and presymptomatic {{types of}} testing {{are used to}} detect gene {{mutations}} associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful {{to people who have}} a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer. Hereditary breast cancer along with ovarian cancer syndrome are caused by gene alterations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Major cancer types related to mutations in these genes are female breast cancer, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and male breast cancer. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by a gene alteration on the gene TP53. Cancer types associated with a mutation on this gene include breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), leukemia and brain tumors. In the Cowden syndrome there is a mutation on the PTEN gene, causing potential breast, thyroid or endometrial cancer. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person <b>will</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> genetic disorder, such as hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a person’s risk of developing a specific disorder, help with making decisions about medical care and provide a better prognosis.|$|E
