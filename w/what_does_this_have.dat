40|$|What {{should the}} d-dimensional analogues of polygons be? The {{short answer is}} “convex d-polytopes”. We may not know what these are yet, {{but that does not}} stop us from asking a number of {{questions}} about them. Example 1. 1. The cube and the octahedron. The cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces, while the octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges and 8 faces. Is this reversal in the number of faces in each dimension common? In the problem session you saw that v-e+f= 2 for 3 -polytopes. Is something similar true in higher dimensions? Are there other restrictions on the number of faces of each dimension? What is the most number of faces in each dimension if we fix the number of vertices and dimension? The least? What if we fix other numbers of faces in random dimensions? Notice that all of these questions involve counting faces of various dimensions. Another situation where these types of questions occur comes is hyperplane ar-rangements. A hyperplane of R d is any set of the form l − 1 v (c) = {x: v · x = c}, where v is a fixed vector in R d and c ∈ R. Consider the arrangement of 5 lines in Figure 1. How are they different?

40|$|This {{editorial}} analyzes from {{a variety}} of perspectives the controversial issue of single-blind versus double-blind reviewing. In single-blind reviewing, the reviewer is unknown to the author, but the identity of the author is known to the reviewer. Double-blind reviewing is more symmetric: The identity of the author and the reviewer are not revealed to each other. We first examine the significant scholarly literature regarding blind reviewing. We then list six benefits claimed for double-blind reviewing and 21 possible costs. To compare these benefits and costs, we propose a double-blind policy for TODS that attempts to minimize the costs while retaining the core benefit of fairness that double-blind reviewing provides, and evaluate that policy against each of the listed benefits and costs. Following that is a general discussion considering several questions: <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>have</b> to do with TODS, does bias exist in computer science, and what is the appropriate decision procedure? We explore the “knobs ” a policy design can manipulate to fine-tune a double-blind review policy. This editorial ends with a specific decision...|$|E

Without realizing it, because there were no “methods ” courses in my master’s degree program, my master’s thesis was a hermeneutical analysis of Chaucer’s Prioress. The requirement of my degree program was to link multiple disciplines in my study of a topic. I chose to explore literature from a historical perspective—to what extent was Chaucer’s Prioress a satirical representation of prioresses of her time? I discovered that although there was much satire in Chaucer’s depiction, there was a lot more accuracy than expected because being a religieux in that time was often not a spiritual calling, but an economic one. Thus, the irreverent behaviors of the Prioress were not completely satirical. But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>have</b> to do with that editorial?

30|$|Long {{experience}} {{has taught me}} this about the progress of science: Communities of scientists typically work within a framework of common understanding, rarely questioning the scientific basis of that understanding. Then along comes a scientist with a fundamentally new insight that {{calls into question the}} framework of that common understanding and sheds light on a new more-correct basis of understanding; a new paradigm which admits a host of new discoveries (Kuhn 1962). For example, in the classical, pre-quantum physics paradigm, an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium was calculated to emit radiation with essentially infinite power in the shorter wavelengths, the so-called ultraviolet catastrophe, a physical impossibility. A scientist of the early twentieth century (in late twentieth century language) might likely have asked, “What’s wrong with this picture?” The answer in this historically significant example is that light is not continuous; classical physics ceases to hold in the domain now better explained by quantum physics. So, one might ask, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>have</b> to do with exploration for petroleum and natural gas deposits?
