5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, he explained that Coppola <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E
25|$|When a {{parliamentary}} inquiry {{was set up}} in 2017 to look into a banks dividend scandal, Schäuble had to confront public criticism that he <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to ban a double ownership loophole that let two parties claim ownership of the same shares and allowed both parties to claim tax rebates, causing the state to lose billions of euros in tax.|$|E

The CAB also determined that the pilot had available alternative procedures which would have enabled him to complete the maneuver safely. The cause of the crash was ultimately determined {{to be due to}} pilot error.|$|E

25|$|In June 2014, Cuyahoga County sued former County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora, former County Auditor Frank Russo, and 10 {{other former}} officials, private developers, lawyers, and {{companies}} for recommending the Cleveland Trust complex purchase. The county claimed that Dimora, Russo, {{and the others}} conspired to have the county purchase the complex from the Jacobs Group (with whom they had a business relationship) {{with the intent of}} steering its eventual sale to associates at a lower price. The county lost $18 million on the eventual sale of the five buildings. In February 2016, Judge Patricia Cosgrove ruled that the county had <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to bring its complaint under a state statute of limitations law.|$|E
25|$|Although Howe had {{defeated}} the American army, the unexpected resistance {{he had met}} prevented him from destroying it completely. The American morale had not been destroyed; despite losing the battle, the Americans had good spirits hoping to fight the British again another day. But neither commander in the battle had proven themselves. Washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank wide open and nearly brought on destruction {{if it had not}} been for Sullivan, Sterling, and Stephen's divisions that fought for time. Howe had <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to attack the American right flank, showing again his lack of killer instincts because he was still afraid of sustaining heavy casualties since the costly victory at the Battle of Bunker Hill two years earlier, and thus allowed most of the American army to escape.|$|E
25|$|Laxalt {{retired from}} the Senate in 1987 and was {{replaced}} by the man he had defeated in 1974, Harry Reid, who would go on to become the Senate Majority Leader. Laxalt made a brief run for the Republican Presidential nomination during 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a leg up in organization, but many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of George H.W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in Bob Dole's failed presidential bid.|$|E

25|$|During {{the filming}} of Contact on December 28, 1996, Coppola {{filed a lawsuit against}} Carl Sagan and Warner Bros. Sagan had died a week earlier and Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel Contact was based on a story the pair had {{developed}} for a television special back in 1975, titled First Contact. Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions, as well as any novel Sagan would write. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon & Schuster published Sagan's Contact and Warner Bros. moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film. Even though Sagan was shown to have violated some of the terms of the agreement, the case was dismissed in February 1998 because Coppola had <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to file suit.|$|E
500|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{dismissed}} May 26, 2015, by a Los Angeles judge who ruled that Robson <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to seek legal action.

500|$|Mead {{noted that}} [...] "the book builds toward second chances for Miranda's mother—both vocationally and relationally." [...] As the novel progresses, Miranda gives second chances to Julia, {{a girl who}}m Miranda {{initially}} hates, and Alice, a girl who always needs {{to use the bathroom}} but never does. Miranda previously considered Julia [...] "a competitor for Annemarie's affection, and Alice as the weird kid who <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to go to the bathroom". By the end of the book, she finds Julia to be Annemarie's friend and discovers that Alice is an insecure girl.|$|E

500|$|Priscilla Durham's step-brother, Kenneth Pate, who {{was imprisoned}} with Abu-Jamal on other charges, has since claimed that Durham {{admitted}} {{she had not}} heard the [...] "hospital confession" [...] she had testified to. The hospital doctors said that Abu-Jamal was [...] "on the verge of fainting" [...] when brought in {{and they did not}} hear any confession. In 2008, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rejected a further request from Abu-Jamal for a hearing into claims that the trial witnesses perjured themselves, on the grounds that he had <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> before filing the appeal.|$|E
2500|$|Some journalists noted {{similarities}} between Miller's revised policy and that proposed by John Tory in 2003. [...] Miller also called upon Toronto's business leaders to target street crime by providing jobs for unemployed youth; one year later, {{he was able}} to report increased hirings in both the public and private sectors. [...] Some councillors, including Michael Thompson, suggested that Miller <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> before reacting to reports of increased violence.|$|E
2500|$|Continued {{activism}} from SaveWCAL, however, {{resulted in}} a state district court judge characterizing the transaction [...] as an illegal sale of a charitable trust by an irresponsible trustee [...] SaveWCAL has since requested that the Minnesota Attorney General's office to declare the sale void [...] and filed a Petition To Redress Breach of Trust [...] in Rice County District Court on September 24, 2008.

2500|$|Another Supreme Court case, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., saw a {{judgment}} {{in favor of}} plaintiff Lily Ledbetter—which had awarded her back pay and damages for several years of receiving disproportionately low pay in comparison to her male counterparts—overturned because she <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to file suit. After a 5-4 decision, the majority cited reasoning that [...] "Federal law states that 'employees must file their discrimination complaints within 180 days of the incident,'" [...] a task that dissenting Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg claimed was unreasonable considering that quite often women {{have no reason to}} suspect discrimination until certain unfair patterns develop and they are made aware of them.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning the {{involvement}} of the American military in the 2011 Libyan civil war, Romney initially said in March that Obama had <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> before becoming involved, and he also criticized Obama for ruling out the use of United States ground forces. The next month, he said that he supported the [...] "specific, limited mission" [...] of enforcing a no-fly zone, but that Obama's support for the ouster of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi constituted [...] "mission creep and mission muddle." [...] In October, after Gaddafi's death, Romney said, [...] "I think people across the world recognize that the world is a better place without Muammar Gaddafi." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{accounts}} state that, after {{a three-week}} siege, More delayed surrendering until the bailey {{had been taken}} and {{the entrance to the}} keep was on fire. Under the laws of war as they were practised at that time, such a surrender was at the discretion of the besieging forces, who had taken significant casualties. More had apparently <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to surrender. [...] It seems that Sir Michael Woodhouse chose not to accept the surrender and ordered (or at least did not prevent) the killings. As his men were being killed, Samuel More was taken to Ludlow and was later given his freedom in a prisoner exchange.|$|E

There will be a box social dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women {{to raise funds for}} a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat the lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> [...] He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy ("The Surrey with the Fringe on Top"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.|$|E
2500|$|A {{well-known}} [...] "will-they-won't-they" [...] setups is {{the relationship}} of supercouple Agent Fox Mulder and Agent Dana Scully from the science fiction/thriller series The X-Files. Mulder and Scully, two FBI agents investigating cases that involve the paranormal, are showcased as having a relationship which borders on subtle hints of romance throughout the series without the two being heavily romantically involved. Though anticipation for Mulder and Scully to romantically commit to each other had existed for years among the show's fanbase, the pairing's romantic intimacy was not written as soon as fans would have hoped for; when the two are finally shown sharing a kiss in 1999 after seven seasons of buildup, some viewers felt the show <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to script the event. Critics state that in such cases, if a series extends sexual tension for [...] "too long" [...] before finally acting on romantic intimacy between the characters, it can result in viewers feeling that {{the best part of}} the pairing's buildup was their [...] "will-they-won't-they" [...] status.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War I, Metesky {{joined the}} U.S. Marines, {{serving as a}} {{specialist}} electrician at the United States Consulate in Shanghai. [...] Returning home, {{he went to work}} as a mechanic for a subsidiary of the Consolidated Edison utility company and lived in Waterbury, Connecticut, with his two unmarried sisters. [...] In 1931, Metesky was working as a generator wiper at the company's Hell Gate generating plant when a boiler backfire produced a blast of hot gases. The blast knocked Metesky down and the fumes filled his lungs, choking him. The accident left him disabled and, after collecting 26 weeks of sick pay, he lost his job. [...] According to claims disputed by Consolidated Edison, the accident led to pneumonia that in turn developed into tuberculosis. [...] A claim for workers' compensation was denied because he <b>waited</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to file it. [...] Three appeals of the denial were also rejected, the last in 1936. [...] He developed a hatred for the company's attorneys and for the three co-workers whose testimony in his compensation case he believed was perjured in favor of the company.|$|E
