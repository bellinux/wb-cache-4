500|$|Sakurai {{originally}} {{stated that}} he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> Japan-only characters. However, reflecting upon Marth and Roy's inclusion in Melee, which led to the international release of the [...] Fire Emblem series, he became more interested in characters exclusive to Japan-only releases. Sakurai said that third-party characters would amount to two at the most, aside from Snake. The inclusion of Konami-created character Solid Snake may seem to conflict with the Super Smash Bros. paradigm—to only include characters from games made by Nintendo and its second parties—but Sakurai said that Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima [...] "practically begged" [...] for Snake to be included in Super Smash Bros. Melee, which did not happen since the game was too far into development. This in turn led to his appearance in the following game instead. Similarly, the now-playable Lucas from Mother 3 was intended to be used in Melee, but was left out due to the delay of Mother3.|$|E

2500|$|All Chablis is made 100% {{from the}} Chardonnay grape. Some wine experts, such as Jancis Robinson, {{believe that the}} wine from Chablis {{is one of the}} [...] "purest" [...] {{expressions}} of the varietal character of Chardonnay, because of the simple style of winemaking favored in this region. Chablis winemakers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the terroir of the calcareous soil and cooler climate that help maintain high acidity. Chablis wines are characterized by their greenish-yellow color and clarity. The racy, green apple-like acidity is a trademark of the wines and can be noticeable in the bouquet. The acidity can mellow with age and Chablis are some of the longest living examples of Chardonnay. The wines often have a [...] "flinty" [...] note, sometimes described as [...] "goût de pierre à fusil" [...] (gunflint) and sometimes as [...] "steely". Some examples of Chablis can have an earthy [...] "wet stone" [...] flavor that intensifies as it ages, before mellowing into delicate honeyed notes. Like most white Burgundies, Chablis can benefit from some bottle age. While producers' styles and vintage can play an influential role, Grand Cru Chablis can generally age for well over 15 years while many Premier Crus will age well for at least 10 years.|$|E
