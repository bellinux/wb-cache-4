5|$|The 2014 season <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> {{the best}} season for Hughes, {{pitching}} to a 3.52 ERA in 209 2/3 innings. On September 24, 2014 Hughes ended {{the season with}} the best strikeout-to-walk ratio ratio in a single season in MLB history (11.625).|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Grace celebrated his 30th {{birthday}} in July 1878, he <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> {{the most famous}} man in England; {{but he was also}} one of the most controversial on account of his gamesmanship and moneymaking. Both of these aspects were subject to serious challenge in the light of events in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone. It's not only {{hard to believe that}} a sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, but that it actually would be followed by a movie that <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> worse—Jaws: the Revenge.|$|E
5|$|Even though Maryland did not {{secede from}} the Union, Steuart's loyalty lay with the South, as did {{that of his}} father. He {{commanded}} one of the Baltimore city militias during the riot of April 1861, following which Federal troops occupied Baltimore, an incident which <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> the first armed confrontation of the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, {{following}} {{five years}} of inactivity, Frank and Ravetch returned to screen writing for Norma Rae, with Martin Ritt directing. The film {{tells the story of}} a factory worker from the Southern United States who becomes involved in labour union activities. Unusually, for the couple, the film was based on a true story, that of Crystal Lee Jordan. It <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> their best received film, winning numerous awards, including two Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|June 2004 <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> of {{the most}} intense months of summitry {{in the history of}} transatlantic relations.

5|$|Most significant, however, was the {{development}} in 1776 {{of the industrial}} steam engine by James Watt and Matthew Boulton. Freeing {{for the first time}} the manufacturing capacity of human society from the limited availability of hand, water and animal power, this <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> the pivotal moment of the entire industrial revolution and a key factor in the worldwide increases in productivity that would follow over the following century.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{economic}} and political crisis <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> the worst since the country's independence. By the end of 2002, the economy had contracted by 20% since 1998. Over {{the course of two}} years, output fell by more than 15%, the Argentine peso lost three-quarters of its value, and registered unemployment exceeded 25%. Income poverty in Argentina grew from an already high 35.4% in October 2001 to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E

5|$|Reckless is {{the fourth}} studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams. Released on 5 November 1984 by A Records, the album was co-produced by Adams and Bob Clearmountain, and it <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> Adams' most {{successful}} solo album. The album was a huge international hit, selling over 5 million units in the United States {{for a total of}} 12 million worldwide. It was the first Canadian album to sell more than a million units within Canada. The album reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 and reached high positions on album charts worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared an intense rivalry as cities. For more than a century after its founding, Boston <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> the educational, cultural, artistic, and {{economic}} power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{attended}} Blanca Malaret High School in Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico. After {{graduating in}} 2000, Sánchez pitched for four seasons at Ohio Dominican University in Columbus, Ohio. While at the university, Sánchez threw four no-hitters and set school records for most strikeouts {{in a single}} game (sixteen), most strikeouts in a single season (105), most strikeouts in a career (311), and most shutouts in a career (ten). However, his final collegiate appearance <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> his worst, as he was saddled with the loss in the Panthers' NAIA regional playoff defeat to Saint Vincent College, going five innings and allowing six runs on six hits.|$|E

5|$|The best attested sibling of Heraclius the Younger <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> Theodore. Maria, {{sister of}} Heraclius the Younger, is {{mentioned}} by Nikephoros I and identified as mother of Martina, whom Heraclius the Younger {{would go on}} to marry. It should be noted, however, that both Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian consider Martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of Heraclius the Younger, thus casting some doubt on the precise relation. Finally, Theophanes briefly mentions another Gregoras as a brother of Heraclius the Younger {{on the occasion of the}} former's death at Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) circa 652/653. This is the only mention of this sibling. Theophanes, however, might have misunderstood the relation between Gregoras and the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Vagaland, {{who grew}} up in Walls, <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> Shetland's finest poet of the 20th century. Haldane Burgess was a Shetland historian, poet, novelist, violinist, {{linguist}} and socialist and Rhoda Bulter (1929–94) is one of the best-known Shetland poets of recent times. Other 20th and 21st century poets and novelists include Christine De Luca, Robert Alan Jamieson {{who grew up}} in Sandness, the late Lollie Graham of Veensgarth, Stella Sutherland of Bressay, the late William J Tait from Yell and Laureen Johnson.|$|E
5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} {{anticipate}} Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed {{him to make a}} prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It <b>was</b> <b>arguably</b> his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E
