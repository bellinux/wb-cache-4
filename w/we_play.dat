Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' <b>We</b> <b>play</b> the way <b>we</b> <b>play,</b> and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E

500|$|By 1980, [...] "Captain Jack" [...] had mostly {{disappeared}} from Joel's concert setlists. Nevertheless, he always played it in Philadelphia, {{because he never}} forgot the role the song and the city played in his early career. A version recorded at The Spectrum in July 1980 was used on his live album, Songs in the Attic. Joel wrote, [...] "'Captain Jack' plays with much more power and conviction when a roaring Philadelphia audience sets off a kind of internal explosion and the adrenaline screams through our veins ... When <b>we</b> <b>play</b> 'Captain Jack', we are actually committing an act of pure brutality." [...] Timothy White of Rolling Stone did not like this version, calling it [...] "grating".|$|E

After the quarterfinal victory, Solo commented on the performance and spirit of the U.S. players during the match, [...] "Even when we were a player down and a goal behind in extra time, you sensed that something was going to happen", and added that [...] " [...] team kept fighting.

500|$|In {{addition}} to his mohawk hairstyle, Wilson has a large black beard, which he began growing and presumably dyeing during the Giants' playoff run in 2010. He never admitted to dyeing it, saying in 2010, [...] "It's dark because <b>we</b> <b>play</b> a lot of day games. It's tanned. It's focused." [...] He decided he would not shave until the Giants' season was over, and only if they failed to win the World Series. During the Giants' playoff run in 2010, Giants' fans began growing their own beards or wearing fake beards. Many fans chanted [...] "Fear the Beard", and held up signs bearing the same motto. Teammate Sergio Romo also began growing a beard in 2010; he has had it intermittently ever since.|$|E
500|$|Robert Smith's {{personal}} favourite is {{the cover}} recorded by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr., which was released {{as a single}} in the UK in 1989 (and 1990 in the US).

The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when we finished it we {{liked it so much}} we didn't want to give it to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a cover version before or since", and even said the cover has [...] "influenced how <b>we</b> <b>play</b> it live".|$|E

5000|$|According to Broadrick: [...] "You Suffer" [...] {{was largely}} a comedy thing, one-second song. Utterly retarded.

500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo while the {{production}} was handled by Dave Fortman. It was recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles, mixed by Dave Fortman at Ocean Way Studios, Los Angeles and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, New York. The programming was done by DJ Lethal. Talking about The Open Door, Lee said that lot of people expected the new songs on the album to be similar with [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003) before adding that [...] "'Weight of the World', 'Sweet Sacrifice' and 'All That I'm Living For' are so amazing to me because of the adrenaline.

500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said in {{his press}} conference: [...] "The game will be {{competitive}}.

[...] He {{wanted to use the}} game as a means of preparing his team for their UEFA Champions League third qualifying round game against Dinamo București the following Wednesday. Ferguson was concerned about the state of his squad, with several first team players injured. He was irked that senior players Cristiano Ronaldo and Gabriel Heinze were absent, on duty for their respective national teams at the Summer Olympics: [...] "Apparently, it's supposed to be for amateurs, and money earned is put in trust, but we will be paying their wages while they are away so I don't know what that's all about." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} career start, Scott ran for 157yards, but Friedgen {{thought he could}} have done better. Friedgen said, [...] "He was a little tired from camp... Normally, he would break some of those runs. I don't think he quite had his third gear today." [...] Steffy played a solid first half, but in the second, threw two interceptions before {{suffering}} a season-ending thumb fracture. He was replaced by back-up Chris Turner who started {{for the remainder of the}} season. Regarding their loss, Delaware head coach K.C. Keeler said, [...] "This is not like a moral victory. I don't believe in moral victories... This was not a payday for us... <b>We</b> <b>play</b> a home game, we make more money than playing this game down here. When we scheduled this game, I thought our program would possibly be in a position to beat a solid ACC school." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{released}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>play</b> Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening the 2011–12 season, Cammalleri {{scored the}} first NHL regular season goal at the MTS Centre as Montreal spoiled {{the debut of}} the new Winnipeg Jets {{franchise}} with a 5–1 victory.

He struggled throughout {{the first part of the}} season, and with the team also losing, was booed by the fans in Montreal during a 3–0 defeat against the St. Louis Blues. Following the game, he expressed his frustration, quoted as saying: [...] "I can't accept that we will display a losing attitude as we're doing this year. We prepare for our games like losers. <b>We</b> <b>play</b> like losers. So it's no wonder why we lose." [...] The commentary sparked controversy, while the Montreal Gazette suggested later that the comments, originally spoken in English, were misrepresented after they were translated to French by Réseau des sports then translated back to English.|$|E
500|$|Although it was {{omitted from}} a number of concerts because of short time allotments, Slayer have often said that they enjoy playing the album in its entirety. According to Hanneman: [...] "We still enjoy playing these songs live. <b>We</b> <b>play</b> these songs over and over and over, but they're good songs, intense songs! If it were melodic songs or some kind of boring 'clap your hands' song, you'd be going crazy playing those every night. But our songs are just bam-bam-bam-bam, they're intense." [...] The band was on stage for 70 minutes, which only allowed seven or eight {{additional}} songs to be played following the album's play. King stated this arrangement [...] "alienates too many people". In the Unholy Alliance Tour of 2004, however, the album was played in its entirety during Slayer's set as the last ten songs to end the show. The album was performed live at the I'll Be Your Mirror London festival in May 2012. In May 2014, it was announced that Slayer would perform the album in its entirety at Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver.|$|E
