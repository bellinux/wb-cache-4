Early chairmen Arthur Bundock and Joseph Hodel were involved in construction of key architecture such as the Ross River Bridge, the bridge at the Causeway and the Stuart Creek Bridge. These roads and bridges were constructed to serve not only Thuringowa's rural base but also its residential subdivisions of Hermit Park, Mundingburra and Rosslea. <b>Water</b> <b>reticulation</b> and sanitary services were established in these suburbs and street lighting and beautification work was carried out along Charters Towers Road. Also during this period the Council's first administration building was constructed at the Causeway, near the intersection of Flinders Street West and Ingham Road.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of their work 1 ACAU {{personnel}} were quite vulnerable to enemy action and potentially could have suffered heavy casualties if the Viet Cong had decided to target them. Many members spent time alone in villages while civil affairs vehicles often traveled routes with just a driver and one passenger. Yet overall, there was little hostile action against members of the unit. In the early days after the unit's arrival in Nui Dat, there were sniper incidents in Hoa Long, and a medical team became involved in a contact in Hoi My, south of Dat Do, during which several 1 ACAU members sustained minor gunshot wounds. There were other minor incidents later also, for example, when the Viet Cong destroyed the <b>water</b> <b>reticulation</b> system on Long Son island, just days after it came into operation.

50|$|Settlement in {{the area}} may have been chosen for the {{presence}} of perennial water sources (from Shashe and Vukwi Rivers). In the late 20th century the village streached along the river bank from the North to the South with the west being locals' seasonal farm land. The eastern side of the Shashe river is the North East District tribal land and it is predominately elite villagers' farm land and ranches administered in Masunga Village. The increase in population and <b>water</b> system <b>reticulation</b> by government saw new settlers being allocated residential land on the underprivileged villagers' seasonal farm land in the west.

Current <b>water</b> resources management tends to be fragmented and focused purely on supply side management. It is not economically and environmentally sustainable to focus purely on augmenting supply to meet increasing demand. Sustainable water resources management requires a broader more holistic approach.

One is closer to a centralized government planning model and the other is a more radical privatisation flavoured model. The thesis investigates the current water demand and supply balance for residential, commercial and industry; and propose a balanced strategy to meet the HCMC&# 039;s demand until year 2020. The amount of water savings are calculated by implementing a suite of water conservation initiatives. The proposed initatives will substantially narrow the gap between the planned supply and forecasted demand, thus providing a acceptable reasonable supply security for the community...|$|R

40|$|Dual {{distribution}} {{systems are}} becoming increasingly common in new housing developments in Australia for the redistribution of recycled water back to households for non-potable use. Within such schemes {{there is a potential}} for cross-connections between recycled and drinking water systems, and numerous examples have been reported. Whilst these events are unlikely to present a source of health concern in Australia given the high level of recycled water treatment, they do have the potential to undermine public confidence in dual <b>reticulation</b> systems and <b>water</b> recycling in general. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a potentially rapid, highly sensitive method of cross-connection detection which may therefore provide an additional level of confidence in these schemes and as such is investigated within this thesis. Fluorescence was used to discern potable water from finished recycled water with respect to typical variation across a range of treatment trains. Multivariate analysis showed Peak T, (ex/em = 300 nm/ 350 nm) to be the most appropriate peak for cross-connection detection, where it was shown to be a more sensitive technique than electrical conductivity, pH, turbidity, free chlorine, UV absorbance, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). As such, portable fluorescence devices which target Peak T were assessed in situ and shown to effectively distinguish finished recycled water from potable water and hence as portable tools for cross-connection detection. The ability for a portable fluorescence device to detect cross-connections was confirmed by successful device implementation in a field survey of a dual <b>reticulation</b> <b>water</b> recycling network...|$|R
40|$|Problem: Two {{earthquakes}} recently {{struck the}} Christchurch region. The 2010 earthquake in Canterbury was strong yet sustained less damage than the 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, which {{although not as}} strong, was more damaging and resulted in 185 deaths. Both required activation of a food safety response. Context: The food safety response for both earthquakes was focused on {{reducing the risk of}} gastroenteritis by limiting the use of contaminated water and food, both in households and food businesses. Additional food safety risks were identified in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake due the use of large-scale catering for rescue workers, volunteers and residents unable to return home. Action: Using a risk assessment framework, the food safety response involved providing water and food safety advice, issuing a boil water notice for the region and initiating <b>water</b> testing on <b>reticulation</b> systems. Food businesses were contacted to ensure the necessary measures were being taken. Additional action during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake response included making contact with food businesses using checklists and principles developed in the first response and having regular contact with those providing catering for large numbers. Outcome: In the 2010 earthquake in Canterbury, several cases of gastroenteritis were reported, although most resulted from person-to-person contact rather than contamination of food. There was a small increase in gastroenteritis cases following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Discussion: The food safety response for both earthquakes was successful in meeting the goal of ensuring that foodborne illness did not put additional pressure on hospitals or affect search and rescue efforts...|$|R

40|$|Edition {{prepared}} by the group of authors and finalized by Gil Mahé, Scientific EditorPeriodic, often ENSO-related widespread droughts in eastern Australia frequently generate severe bush fires. These can devastate water supply catchments and have serious impacts on {{the quality and quantity}} of domestic water supplies. The implications for water supplies sourced from native forests and their management are profound. The Cotter River Catchment in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), eastern Australia has been a major source of water for the national capital, Canberra, since 1918. Previous work following the 1939 bushfires in alpine ash (Eucalyptus Regnans) catchments in the southern Australia state of Victoria found large decreases in yields (of the order of 30 %) for up to 50 years following the fires as forests regrew. It is shown here that the response of catchments with mixed native forests to fires differs from the alpine ash forests in Victoria. Slight increases in yield appear initially over the first 30 months because of the decreases in evapotranspiration. It is thought that as epicormic regeneration of eucalypts continues small decreases in yield of less than 10 % could occur for some years but similar results occur after severe droughts without bushfires. Dramatic increases in turbidity, iron, manganese, organic carbon, phosphorous and nitrogen in the reservoirs resulted from the 2003 fires and these persisted for over 12 months. This made <b>water</b> unfit for <b>reticulation</b> as the <b>water</b> needed treatment and forced water restrictions on the ACT for the first time since 1968. The fires revealed problems in the monitoring of catchment water resources and in the management of water resources in the ACT. From our analysis of the aftermath of the fires we suggest changes to the management of water resources in the ACT to improve planning for and response to bush fires and their consequences for domestic water supplies. The relationship between the occurrence and effects of major bush fires with climate and hydrological variables is investigated in this paper. Trevor Daniell, Ian Whit...|$|R
