Agriculture provides the bulk of <b>wage</b> <b>goods</b> required by non-agriculture sectors and most of the raw materials for the industries sector. India is a largely agrarian economy - with 52.1% of the population estimated to directly or indirectly employed in agriculture and allied sectors in 2009-10. The combined efforts of Central Government, State Governments and the farming community have succeeded in achieving record production of 244.78 million tonnes of foodgrains during 2010-11. This record production has been achieved through effective transfer of newly developed crop production technologies to farmers under various crop development schemes, such as the Agriculture MMP, which is run {{under the direction of the}} Department of Agriculture & Cooperation. Other causes behind record production include remunerative prices for various crops through enhanced minimum support prices. Agriculture in India is of significance because of this as well as a history of food shortages and a growing population.|$|E

[...] While balanced mixed economies have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the U.S. Treasury Department, Richard C.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} into the real wage rates of casual labourers in Shillong, the capital city of Meghalaya. First, trends in nominal wages during 1997 - 2000 have been studied. Then the consumption expenditure of casual labourers on <b>wage</b> <b>goods</b> is analysed and finally, changes in prices of <b>wage</b> <b>goods</b> and the cost of living have been investigated during the same period. Sources of data are the primary surveys conducted by the authors. We have found that wage rate (of a general casual laborer) is about Rs. 60 per day, which in case of an unskilled laborer is about Rs. 47 only. With each of the two working members getting some job for 22. 5 days in a month, an average casual labourer household earns Rs 2565 (Rs. 475 per capita per month). For an average unskilled casual laborer household these figures are Rs. 2000 and Rs. 372 (per capita). ILO (1996) defines subsistence wage as the hourly wage sufficient to buy one kilogram of the lowest-priced staple cereal. The price of 1 kilogram of rice (the staple cereal in the study area) varied between Rs. 8. 5 to Rs. 10. 0 during 1996 - 1998. The range was Rs. 10 to 11. 5 in 1998 - 2000. The upper limit of daily wage rates of unskilled casual workers was Rs. 50. Work hours (per day) were 7 to 8 hours. From these figures, the hourly wage rate works out to be Rs. 7. 0 or less, which cannot buy 1 kilogram of rice. Thus, casual laborers in Shillong earn only a subsistence wage. Rice and house rent are the first two major claimants, accounting for some 40 percent of the total expenditure on <b>wage</b> <b>goods.</b> Beef, fuel and pan (+betel nuts) are the next significant claimants accounting for an additional 24 percent of the total expenditure. Potatoes, onions and vegetables together claim for some 9 percent and sugar, tea and milk together account for about 7 percent of the total expenditure. Fish, beef, meat (includes pork and mutton), potatoes, onions, vegetables and mustard oil together claim for a little over 30 percent of the total expenditure. In the later half of our study period, wages of unskilled labourers have systematically lagged behind the increase in the cost of living index. Wage rates of unskilled labourers have increased by 11 to 12 percent while the cost of living has increased by 20 percent during the study period. Wage rates of skilled labourers, which increases by (about) 80 percent or so, succeeded at overpowering the increase in the cost of living. The unlimited supply of unskilled casual labourers from the rural Meghalaya, Nepal, Bihar, Bengal, Bangla Desh, Assam, etc to Shillong has kept up an excess supply of unskilled casual labourers. However, {{that is not the case}} with the skilled casual labourers. Additionally, urbanization, development and rise in secondary and tertiary sector activities in Shillong has created jobs for skilled casual labourers more in proportion than that for the unskilled casual labourers. ...|$|E

The current regime is left with hierarchical state/labor relations wrapped around a core of atomizational pluralism.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to systematize the {{economic}} policy implemented by the Brazilian Government since the 2000 ’s {{in order to promote}} economic growth, formal employment increases, wages rise and a less concentrated distribution of labor income. The period of prosperity in the world economy up to 2008 created the conditions for the growth of the South American economies. In Brazil this period of economic growth came along with the expansion of the formal labour market, wages increase and redistributive public policies such as passive and active labour market policies, and massive cash transfers programs focusing poor families. This strategy diminished the poverty indexes and widened the consumption of <b>wage</b> <b>goods.</b> Yet there are evidences that the concentration of the functional distribution increased due the persistence of high interest rates. The trend toward less inequality in labour income distribution can continue if Asia support Brazilian exports, if the domestic demand expands and if more investments are made in education and infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the Philippine labor market by fitting a labor supply equation using detailed firm {{data from the}} survey of manufactures. The Philippines continues to have high rates of unemployment and underemployment amidst a continuously rising labor supply. The results of the econometric effort confirm {{the description of the}} economy as falling within the zone of abundant labor supply at best if not within in the unlimited zone of labor supply. Segregating the different sizes of firms as individual characteristics does not change the basic econometric finding.

Taking account of specific industry characteristics brings out some unique findings. Labor intensive export industries and some <b>wage</b> <b>goods</b> industries organized under large firms tend to be sensitive to movements in the wage rate.

40|$|The {{controversy}} between optimists and pessimists {{that followed}} and keeps dividing the economists {{is the result}} of the absence in the dominating economic theory of an analytical framework able to deal properly with out-of-equilibrium processes as is the one through which a technological restructuring of production takes place. This theory looks in fact at capital as a stock of physical goods into which free capital has been already embodied, and which is divided into fixed capital goods (structures and machinery) and working capital (which includes <b>wage</b> <b>goods).</b> The Neo-Austrian representation of the process of production introduced by Hicks puts into the shade the argument of fixed vs. circulating capital that has characterized the controversy, to shift the focus on the real issue at stake in the technological restructuring process, that is, ‘that investment at cost is not the same as investment of output capacity’. It allows re-establishing the classic analysis of the wage fund as the economic beginning of a production process. Focusing on the coordination problems involved in phase of restructuring, the paper confirms the Ricardo’s intuition as well as the analytical advance by Hicks, and shows that the so called technological unemployment is not a temporary mechanical problem due to the characteristics of technology but a more general problem due to market behaviours and policies...|$|E
