The "Puna geothermal resource {{area has been}} the focus of keen interest on the part of potential geothermal investors and developers since the demonstration of a proven resource in the region of the HGP-A well at Pohoiki. Two wells have been drilled north of the HGP-A site (in the vicinity of Pu'u Honuaula) by Puna Geothermal Ventures. A floral and faunal survey of this area was performed in early 1984 (Char et. ale 1984) to provide baseline data for future Environmental Impact Statements necessary for activation and associated activities at the PGV <b>wellsites.</b> High densities of Hawaiian Hawk (Buteo solitarius) in this 2010 acre portion of the Puna geothermal resource area became apparant during the field surveys.

This is particularly true of portions of the geothermal resource area that are either adjacent to or downwind of potentially active <b>wellsites.</b> In order to provide a better data base from which to address these concerns, a breeding season survey was conducted to determine breeding density and to better define portions of the site used for nesting activity.

The paper presents the possibility of using pipelines made with the Thermoflex® technology for the transportation of natural gas and carbon dioxide. Pipelines made with this technology can be used for transportation of natural gas from <b>wellsites</b> to natural gas mines installations. Thermoflex pipeline time of instalation is shorter compared to steel pipeline, this issue has great significance in the perspective of future exploitation of natural gas from unconventional reservoirs in Poland. Pipes made using this technology with new polymeric materials are characterized by much lower pressure drop along the pipeline compared to the steel pipelines, much higher maximum operating pressure range compared to polyethylene pipes, better thermal insulation compared to steel, high corrosion resistance and lower installation and operating costs.

A regional goniatite zonation is proposed {{and as part of}} the documentation a ew Frasnian goniatite assigned to the Triainoceratidae is described as <b>Wellsites</b> tynani n. gen, n. sp. The zonation has enabled ocumentation f the timing and extent of facies movements associated with the Catskill Delta and more easterly deposits in New York State. The broad pattern is one of westward progradation ofshallower, more clastic facies. Pulses of deeper water sedimentation, represented by black shale facies indicating anoxic/hypoxic con-ditions, punctuate the succession and give marker levels. Typically, these black shales initiate shallowing upward cycles. The major pulses are represented by the Tully, Geneseo, Renwick, Genundewa, Middlesex, Rhinestreet, Pipe Creek and Dunkirk units. The cycles enable stimates to be made of deepening against a ubsiding shelf; the Rhinestreet Shale represents the greatest. Evidence is given on the regional extent of some of these. International comparison suggests some of these cycles represent global, rather than local events. Microcycles at the Milankovitch Band level also show thin black shales uggesting that climatic ontrol has a bearing on facies developments. General comment ismade on the factors controlling local and eustatic changes. The late Devonian of eastern North America (Fig. 1) is dominated by a terrestrial clastic sequence to the east which has been termed the Catskill Delta.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Management of {{emerging}} technological risks is challenged by scientific uncertainty about relevant impacts and frequent gaps between expert and lay perceptions of risk. Engaging in deliberation {{can help to}} foster learning about interests, values and concerns among diverse stakeholders, resulting in policies that reflect not only scientific knowledge but stakeholder values and concern. Where policy arrangements are flexible, the benefits of deliberation may be most evident. My dissertation project demonstrates that engagement between firms, citizens, and governments {{can be used in}} managing emerging risks, but that government managers {{play an important role in}} structuring deliberation and ensuring firms respond to resident concerns. I evaluate oil and gas management policies in the State of Colorado as a case of using engagement and deliberation to manage emerging risks. It studies two engagement processes in detail. Specifically, I first study the voluntary adoption of engagement by individual operating firms as a management practice. I then study the filing of citizen complaints with the State oil and gas regulatory agency as a citizen-led engagement mechanism. In the first chapter, I evaluate whether firm voluntarily adoption of engagement and deliberation strategies alters the odds of citizens filing complaints. Using a spatial case control model, I demonstrate that engagement and deliberation have the potential to mitigate the increased risks of complaints. At <b>wellsites</b> where companies adopt more restrictive practices, use of engagement and deliberation is associated with relative reductions in complaint behavior. Additionally, I find that larger companies are most likely to adopt engagement practices. In the second chapter I test firm motivations for adopting voluntary management practices including engagement. I explicitly focus on how firms might learn from complaints and choose to adapt practices. I make novel use of text similarity methods to evaluate firm level change in practices in relation to motivations and potential feedback sources. The results demonstrate that using information from complaints, fines, warnings, towards practice changes requires firms to be motivated to do so. Potential motivations identified as critical include coercive pressure from regulatory agencies and pressures from other firms. Relying on the first project for case selection, in the third chapter of the dissertation I evaluate the psychological and contextual foundations of complaint behavior. The paper is hypothesis generating, and suggest five hypotheses about how complaints are driven by contexts and perceptions of oil and gas development. Based on 17 semi-structured interviews with citizen complainants, I find that while complaints are behavioral response to observed threats, they are not necessarily a strong reflection of violations of official rules. Instead, citizens file may file complaints in order to convey perceptions and concerns to regulators and firms. This finding provides an indication that engagement may increase compliant behavior as engagement with firms can make evidence recorded via complaining useful within deliberations. In the conduct of research, I found that complaints, themselves, fostered direct discussion between citizens and firms. The fourth chapter builds on Chapter Three to propose hypotheses about what enables complaining to foster deliberation and learning. I find that institutions play a critical role in motivating deliberation between residents and firms. However, science-based evidence may detract from the development of deliberation as it provides yes/no conclusions on regulatory standards. This suggests that government actors play a key role even in motivating voluntary engagement by structuring rules and motivations for industry outreach...|$|R

5000|$|Natural gas {{is almost}} always a {{byproduct}} of producing oil, since the small, light gas carbon chains come out of solution as they undergo pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a bottle of soda where the carbon dioxide effervesces. Unwanted natural gas can be a disposal problem at the well site. If {{there is not a}} market for natural gas near the wellhead it is virtually valueless since it must be piped to the end user. Until recently, such unwanted gas was burned off at the <b>wellsite,</b> but due to environmental concerns this practice is becoming less common. Often, unwanted (or 'stranded' gas without a market) gas is pumped back into the reservoir with an 'injection' well for disposal or repressurizing the producing formation.

5000|$|Tools {{to detect}} {{oil and gas}} have been {{evolving}} for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is well cuttings examination. Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a <b>wellsite</b> geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic microscope to determine the lithology of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining. A portable ultraviolet light chamber or [...] "Spook Box" [...] is {{used to examine the}} cuttings for fluorescence. Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals. They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish. The solvent is usually carbon tetrachlorethane. Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates. The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.|$|E
5000|$|Well {{cuttings}} examination is {{a learned}} skill. During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about 1/8 inch (6 mm) across, are {{cut from the}} bottom of the hole by the bit. Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole. During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning drillpipe, mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction. They then are screened out of the mudstream by the shale shaker and fall on a pile at its base. Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the 'lag time' between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the <b>wellsite</b> geologist (or mudlogger as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material. Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a [...] "bit trip" [...] when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit. At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (cavings), making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.|$|E

Focusing on the impacts of one component of energy development, we studied the selection patterns of radio-collared grizzly bears in relation to oil and gas wellsites in the Kakwa region of west -central Alberta. For each grizzly bear foraging season (spring, summer, and fall), we calculated a population level resource selection function (RSF) to assess the probability that bears would select for wellsites versus non-wellsite habitat. We used mixed-effects logistic regression and model selection to examine factors that could influence the probability of <b>wellsite</b> use, including: grizzly bear reproductive status, <b>wellsite</b> age, <b>wellsite</b> operational status, surrounding road and <b>wellsite</b> densities, adjacent forest canopy cover, and adjacent habitat. Bear reproductive status, surrounding road and <b>wellsite</b> densities, and adjacent canopy cover had the most influence on the probability of <b>wellsite</b> use. Females used wellsites more than expected in all seasons, and males selected for wellsites in summer and fall. Males used wellsites less than females, and females with young used wellsites more than both single females and males. Bears were more likely to use wellsites that had lower densities of disturbance (roads and wellsites) in the surrounding area. In the fall, older wellsites were also more likely to be used by bears. In areas with human access, grizzly bears attracted to anthropogenic features are at a higher risk of human-caused mortality; therefore, their use of wellsites could have negative results for this threatened population...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of <b>wellsite</b> biostratigraphic technique has aided {{the reconstruction of}} the subsurface geology in the Nigerian deepwater region. It has further aided decision making during drilling operations including the planning of well paths. Critical decisions regarding casing setting, coring point selection, overpressure zone determination and total depth picks, are easily achieved through confirmation of well prognosis and correlation to offset wells. This technique is very important in the tectonically active Nigerian deepwater region which is characterized by varying degrees of both syn-depositional and post-depositional deformation. Accurate interpretation of basin architecture, lateral variation and facies change is required before drilling. Confirmation of well prognosis during drilling operation is equally important. It has been proved that <b>wellsite</b> biostratigraphic technique helps to “get it right at first” when integrated with the traditional lithologic description, log signature correlation and seismic profile interpretations. The modern and rapid processing technique of calcareous nannofossil, for instance, provides ‘real time’ result for the exploration team for confirmation of, or adjustment to, the drilling program. The attendant contribution in saved time, cost and safe and successful drilling operation makes the technique beneficial for all operators. This paper presents practical experience of <b>wellsite</b> biostratigraphy application in three oil prolific Nigerian deepwater regions: the Niger Delta, Joint Development zone of Nigeria/Sao Tome and Principe area (JDZ) and Benin (Dahomey) Basin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{periodic}} vibration noise in <b>wellsite</b> {{is an important}} factor which impact analysis on three-dimensional drill string vibration signal. In order to obtain more accurate characters of three-dimensional drill string vibration signal that reflects the drilling tools condition, we conduct researches on the periodic vibration noise in the <b>wellsite,</b> independent component analysis algorithm which based on negative entropy for periodic vibration noise signal separation was adopted. At the same time, in order to improve the effect of algorithm demixing, an improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm was introduced, combining with periodic noise components which exist in three directions of drill string vibration signals to seek the optimal mixed matrix by which can structure multi-channel mixed-signal of independent component analysis algorithm. This method has high similarity after separation each signal components, in operation has high efficiency. Through the experimental simulation, the method was proven feasible in the drill string vibration periodic noise signal separation...|$|E
