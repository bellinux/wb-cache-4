Called A Life For Others, the 138-page book was written by Dr Uma Rajan, the home's executive director. Five hundred hardcover copies of the book have been printed {{to raise funds for}} the Home, <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> S$4.5 million a year to run.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, 2013, WWE {{announced}} that WrestleMania XXX {{would be held}} at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in the city of New Orleans on April 6, 2014. The event is alternatively known as WrestleMania 30. On August 12, travel packages for WrestleMania XXX went on sale, which included tickets to WrestleMania, hotel room accommodation, and other activities including WrestleMania Axxess, the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, and the next Raw; the cheapest package cost $795 per person. On November 16, individual tickets went on sale through Ticketmaster, with prices ranging from $25 to $850. While ordering WrestleMania through pay-per-view television costs between $55 – $70, WWE has also made WrestleMania XXX available live through its new WWE Network online streaming service, <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> $9.99 per month with a six-month contract; WrestleMania was the first event available simultaneously on pay-per-view and on the WWE Network.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, {{the governments}} of both Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for {{international}} aid. Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. A second appeal was made shortly afterwards, which proposed for $5.1million in medicine and other supplies. The red cross and United Nations (UN) appealed for $3million in international relief. The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that {{this would not be}} enough. The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua. Canada donated $220,000via the League of Red Cross Societies. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> $5.1million. The U.S. Embassy in Managua provided $25,000in donations. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief.|$|E
50|$|DDOT-approved globes {{are made}} of glass or plastic. Glass globes (<b>which</b> <b>cost</b> $300 in 2013) are being phased out, as they can seriously injure {{individuals}} and cause property and automobile damage when they break. Most globes used in the city are plastic. These consist of the acrylic globe (<b>which</b> <b>cost</b> $125 in 2013) and the prismatic polycarbonate globe (<b>which</b> <b>cost</b> $200 in 2013).|$|R

5|$|The city {{consists}} of five areas: Lefty's Bar, a hotel casino, a 24-hour wedding chapel, a discothèque, and a convenience store. The player can walk between {{areas that are}} next to each other, but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi, <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> the player money; {{failure to do so}} results in Larry's being mugged or hit by oncoming traffic. During {{the early stages of the}} game, Larry can survive most premature deaths. In the original release, a compartment opens beneath Larry's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra's computer games—such as King's Quest—are re-assembled; in the remake, Larry's remains are instead thrown inside a blender and reformed.|$|E
5|$|Daniel persuades Amy {{to return}} and she {{introduces}} Paul to her son Jimmy (Darcy Tadich). Paul and Jimmy bond, but when he buys Jimmy expensive presents, Amy returns them. Paul fires Kyle from the council's beautification project after he fails to reprimand a handyman for sexually harassing Amy. She convinces him to give Kyle his job back. Paul learns that Sheila {{had a crush on}} him, after Jimmy blackmails her. They later clear the air. Paul gives Amy a job as his executive assistant, but she quits after making a mistake <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> Lassiter's money. Paul proposes to Naomi and she accepts, but she soon has doubts. After an argument, she has a one-night stand with Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Paul forgives Naomi and they agree to call off their engagement. He then decides to get revenge on Josh by getting his good behaviour bond revoked by paying someone to plant illegal peptides in his bag. Naomi breaks up with Paul and leaves for a job overseas. Paul pays Jimmy's father to leave town, resulting in Jimmy not wanting to spend time with him. Paul plans to close Erinsborough High and sell the land to Eden Hills Grammar, so he can push through a luxury housing development. Paul is blackmailed and his personal emails are sent to the media, resulting in him receiving death threats. He hires Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to be his bodyguard. Amy finds a petition to save the school in Paul's penthouse and he confesses to stealing it from Susan's office {{on the day of the}} fire. He is later fired as mayor and the bank calls in his loans, leaving him in financial difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Essence is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's essence capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum essence summons a creature <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> 20 essence, their maximum essence is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain essence. A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more essence to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations' statistics, but every statistic increase costs more essence and reduces the amount of essence available to summon other creations or cast spells. Essence and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|E

5|$|New mixes will {{be added}} {{regularly}} to DJ Hero through downloadable content that can be purchased on the console's respective online stores; content was made available {{on the day of}} the game's release. Unlike Guitar Hero games' downloadable content, <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> approximately US$2 per track, each mix costs approximately $3 to download because of the additional effort needed to create the mixes. Furthermore, mixes are provided only as bundles for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users; the Wii's storefront prevents the selling of bundled packages; instead, each track is offered individually. Critics viewed the lack of individual song selection on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms as a way of limiting consumers' choice, as previous downloadable songs for games such as Guitar Hero allow players on these systems to select individual tracks to purchase from a bundle. The long time between the second downloadable pack (in November 2009) and the third pack (in March 2010) was also believed to be the result of a last-ditch effort by Activision to support the game, and that the few packs released did not meet expectations for the game.|$|E

25|$|The {{closing of}} much of the rail system also led to the {{emptying}} of many rural towns dependent on the railways, creating ghost towns and therefore to a dismantling of the development that had taken place there since the arrival of trains. Argentine agriculture found itself in the difficult position of shipping its goods more inefficiently using road transport, <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> around 72% more than state-owned rail services.|$|E
25|$|Combat can be {{made more}} {{effective}} with weapons like stone axes, spears, and torches. For socializing, a player can obtain musical instruments: wooden horns, maracas and didgeridoos.

25|$|Propane autogas is a {{domestically}} produced {{alternative fuel}} <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> less than conventional fuels. Over the past 30 years, propane autogas has cost, on average, 30 {{percent less than}} gasoline and 40 percent less than diesel. More than 90 percent is produced in the U.S. (and an additional 7 percent from Canada), which lessens American dependency on foreign oil. The fuel burns substantially cleaner than gasoline or diesel.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{customer}} purchasing an item <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> five pence, who possesses several silver sixpence coins. Some of these coins are more debased, {{while others are}} less so – but legally, they are all mandated to be of equal value. The customer would prefer to retain the better coins, and so offers the shopkeeper the most debased one. In turn, the shopkeeper must give one penny in change, and has every reason to give the most debased penny. Thus, the coins that circulate in the transaction will tend {{to be of the}} most debased sort available to the parties.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{the city}} began a major, $1.5-billion {{reconstruction}} {{project on the}} bridge, {{which is expected to}} take up to 25 years. The first phase, <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> $235 million and lasts until 2017, includes replacing ramps, removing the divider on the upper deck, and adding a seventh lane on the upper deck, which is {{to be used as a}} high-occupancy vehicle lane. After the upper deck is replaced, then parts of the lower deck will be replaced, but this necessitates the closure of the lower deck during construction; hence, the MTA opted to replace the upper deck first to add more capacity. The Brooklyn ramps to the bridge are also being rebuilt.|$|E

25|$|Strategies {{to provide}} {{education}} cost effectively include deworming children, <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> about 50 cents per child {{per year and}} reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism could be cut in half by simply providing free sanitary towels. Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing absenteeism and increasing student attention.|$|E
25|$|After {{inauguration of}} the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) found itself to have {{accumulated}} an uncomfortable {{amount of debt}} – almost {{one third of the}} annual state budget of Ethiopia – resulting in difficulties to pay back loans. There is almost no option to provide additional funding for much-needed dry ports, storage facilities, trunk lines and access roads to have the railway integration in place to generate much-needed revenues to balance the debt. Nevertheless, mandatory trunk lines are now being built, such as the new Dire Dawa Dry Port, which alone took 12 months to negotiate and <b>which</b> <b>costs</b> per km of rails roughly 10 times that of the main Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway – Ethiopian authorities consider the costs being very high.|$|E
