The reason these ducks <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of extinction <b>is</b> because their natural habitat, mangrove forests, are being destroyed for timber and fuel, and to expand cultivation. Hunting for food is also a threat.|$|R

Then, Alex Song stamped on Barton, for which Song received a three-match ban.

He organized baseball programs around his community for the National Youth Administration. He also spent time unemployed during the Great Depression. In 1940, Pipp <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of bankruptcy, {{but he managed to}} pay off his debts without going bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; that the government <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not {{be explained by the}} failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E

5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} situation <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> {{of total}} collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, {{it was clear}} that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Denmark was {{an ally of}} the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and it {{was evident}} that Sweden <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of yet another war with that country. A remedy was {{attempted}} by chancellor Nils Brahe, who traveled to Copenhagen in the spring of 1675 {{to try to get the}} Danish princess Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark engaged to the Swedish king. In mid-June 1675, the engagement was officially proclaimed. However, when news arrived of the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin, Danish king Christian V declared war on Sweden that September.|$|E
5|$|For Arsenal, defender Tony Adams {{was ruled}} out with injury, as was Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars, and goalkeeper David Seaman. Anelka did not partake, given his {{transfer}} to Real Madrid <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of being completed. New signings Oleh Luzhny and Sylvinho were both {{named in the}} squad, but whereas Sylvinho started the game, Luzhny was selected as a substitute. Arsenal, like United, lined up in a 4–4–2 formation. Up front, Fredrik Ljungberg was paired with the club's only available recognised striker, Nwankwo Kanu.|$|E

Initially the council met {{in the village of}} Woburn but it was relocated to Birchcliff in 1922, where most of the population was then located. During the Great Depression the local government <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of bankruptcy.

5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated.

Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E
5|$|Addressing {{the loss}} of Pallister, Ferguson signed Jaap Stam from PSV Eindhoven, {{becoming}} the world's most expensive defender in a £10million deal. Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist soon followed, completing a £4.4million transfer in July before Dwight Yorke was controversially drafted in from Aston Villa to become the club's record signing. Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert, who impressed during the World Cup, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of finalising a £9million move from Milan, only for talks to fall through. A £5.5million offer for Ole Gunnar Solskjær from Tottenham Hotspur was accepted, but Solskjær himself turned down the transfer after a meeting with Alex Ferguson.|$|E

5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of {{producing}} proof of {{a new form of}} energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E
5|$|Characterized with disorganized convection, a broad surface trough {{formed in}} {{association}} with the wave the same day and environmental conditions were expected to favor gradual development. Initially, upper-level winds were only marginally favorable, and although the thunderstorms remained disorganized, the NHC estimated a 50%chance for development by early on October12. The next day, the system became better defined, and, the NHC noted that the system <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of becoming a tropical cyclone. Although operationally not classified until 2100UTC on October 13, a post-season analysis conducted on the system revealed that it attained enough organization to be considered a tropical depression at 1200UTC, while positioned about 645mi (1040km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{plan to have}} Mary {{married to}} Louis of France divided the court. The Lackfis, {{the master of the}} {{treasury}} Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August, which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and replacing them with Garai's partisans. The kingdom <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of a civil war when Charles decided to invade, encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul, Bishop of Zagreb. Charles' imminent arrival forced Elizabeth to yield and abandon the idea of French marriage. While her envoys in Paris were preparing for Louis's journey, Elizabeth came to terms with her opponents and designated Szécsi as the new palatine.|$|E

5|$|Her hull was {{launched}} in September 1896, but non-delivery of the ship's main guns delayed her maiden voyage until 1899 and her completion until 1900. In May 1899 Rostislav became the first ship of the Imperial Navy {{to be commanded by}} a member of the House of Romanov, Captain Alexander Mikhailovich. From 1903 to 1912 the ship was the flagship of the second-in-command of the Black Sea Fleet. During the 1905 Russian Revolution her crew <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of mutiny, but ultimately remained loyal to the regime, and actively suppressed the mutiny of the cruiser Ochakov.|$|E
5|$|Lacker was {{instrumental}} in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer Chips Moman and his handpicked musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented {{a significant departure from}} the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still {{had to deal with the}} publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio. Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings, Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.|$|E
