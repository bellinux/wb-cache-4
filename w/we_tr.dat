Recently, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) initiated a standardization process, known as “ 3 G Long-Term Evolution”, concerning the evolution of the existed third generation (3 G) systems. By targeting data rates above 100 Mbps, 3 G LTE will enable people to experience richer communications in terms of new type of services that will integrate voice, video and text. In the context of standardizing next generation wireless systems, efficient Radio Resource Management constitutes a key factor for achieving the performance targets.

40|$|International audienceTandem repeats (TRs) are a {{major element}} of protein {{sequences}} in all domains of life. They are particularly abundant in mammals, where by conservative estimates one in three proteins contain a TR. High generation-scale duplication and deletion rates were reported for nucleic TR units. However, {{it is not known}} whether protein TR units can also be frequently lost or gained providing a source of variation for rapid adaptation of protein function, or alternatively, tend to have conserved TR unit configurations over long evolutionary times. To obtain a systematic picture for proteins <b>TRs,</b> <b>we</b> performed a proteome-wide analysis of the mode of evolution for human TRs. For this purpose, we propose a novel method for the detection of orthologous TRs based on circular profile hidden Markov models. For all detected <b>TRs</b> <b>we</b> reconstructed bi-species <b>TR</b> unit phylogenies across 61 eukaryotes ranging from human to yeast. Moreover, we performed additional analyses to correlate functional and structural annotations of human TRs with their mode of evolution.

For example, ≥ 61 % of all human TRs have been strongly conserved at least since the root of all mammals, approximately 300 Mya ago. Further, we find no human protein TR that shows evidence for strong recent duplications and deletions. The results are in contrast to high generation-scale mutability of nucleic TRs.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{established}} {{an important role}} of histone acetylation in transcriptional control by nuclear hormone receptors. With chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have now investigated whether histone methylation and phosphorylation are also involved in transcriptional regulation by thyroid hormone receptor (<b>TR).</b> <b>We</b> found that repression by unliganded TR {{is associated with a}} substantial increase in methylation of H 3 lysine 9 (H 3 -K 9) and a decrease in methylation of H 3 lysine 4 (H 3 -K 4), methylation of H 3 arginine 17 (H 3 -R 17), and a dual modification of phosphorylation of H 3 serine 10 and acetylation of lysine 14 (pS 10 /acK 14). On the other hand, transcriptional activation by liganded TR is coupled with a substantial decrease in both H 3 -K 4 and H 3 -K 9 methylation and a robust increase in H 3 -R 17 methylation and the dual modification of pS 10 /acK 14. Trichostatin A treatment results in not only histone hyperacetylation but also an increase in methylation of H 3 -K 4, increase in dual modification of pS 10 /acK 14, and reduction in methylation of H 3 -K 9, revealing an extensive interplay between histone acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanism for an increase in H 3 -K 9 methylation during repression by unliganded <b>TR,</b> <b>we</b> demonstrated that <b>TR</b> interacts in vitro with an H 3 -K 9 -specific histone methyltransferase (HMT), SUV 39 H 1.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that TR 2 and TR 4 orphan nuclear receptors bind to direct repeat (DR) {{elements in the}} ε- and γ-globin promoters, and act as molecular anchors for the recruitment of epigenetic corepressors of the multifaceted DRED complex, thereby leading to ε- and γ-globin transcriptional repression during definitive erythropoiesis. Other than the ε- and γ-globin and the GATA 1 genes, TR 4 -regulated target genes in human erythroid cells remain unknown. Here, <b>we</b> identified <b>TR</b> 4 binding sites genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) as human primary CD 34 (+) hematopoietic progenitors differentiated progressively to late erythroid precursors. We also performed whole transcriptome analyses by RNA-seq to identify TR 4 downstream targets after lentiviral-mediated TR 4 shRNA knockdown in erythroid cells. Analyses from combined ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets indicate that DR 1 motifs are more prevalent in the proximal promoters of TR 4 direct target genes, which are involved in basic biological functions (e. g., mRNA processing, ribosomal assembly, RNA splicing and primary metabolic processes). In contrast, other non-DR 1 repeat motifs (DR 4, ER 6 and IR 1) are more prevalent at gene-distal TR 4 binding sites. Of these, approximately 50 % are also marked with epigenetic chromatin signatures (such as P 300, H 3 K 27 ac, H 3 K 4 me 1 and H 3 K 27 me 3) associated with enhancer function. Thus, <b>we</b> hypothesize that <b>TR</b> 4 regulates gene transcription via gene-proximal DR 1 sites as TR 4 /TR 2 heterodimers, while it can associate with novel nuclear receptor partners (such as RXR) to bind to distant non-DR 1 consensus sites.
