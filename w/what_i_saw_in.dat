500|$|The Herald re-emerged as a daily {{paper in}} March 1919. Under Lansbury's {{direction}} it maintained {{a strong and}} ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the Russian Civil War. In February 1920 Lansbury [...] travelled to [...] Russia where he met Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. He published an account: <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>in</b> Russia, but {{the impact of the}} visit was overshadowed by accusations that the Herald was being financed from Bolshevist sources, a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury: [...] "We have received no Bolshevist money, no Bolshevist paper, no Bolshevist bonds". Unknown to Lansbury, the allegations had some truth which, when exposed, caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment. By 1922 the Heralds financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations. Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the [...] paper over to the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925.|$|E
500|$|On 1 December, Benfica won {{its first}} league match {{in their new}} stadium, beating Rio Ave by 2–0. After the match, Camacho defended his team to the press by saying [...] "Eusébio's team is gone." [...] A week later, the team {{defeated}} Paços de Ferreira away, with João Pereira scoring two goals. Because Porto had lost points, Benfica were now only six points {{from the top of}} the league. On the 13th, Benfica won their fifth match in a row, beating Braga at home. After the game, Camacho angrily refuted any idea that Benfica did not play accordingly to expectations: [...] "A poor performance? That's not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>In</b> football there are two teams. Everyone knows that, against Benfica, all teams give their best, and we suffer that in the first half, because Braga played like every other team here. It is like the story of the bottle, for the optimist it is half full; for the pessimist, it is half empty." [...] On the same day, they were drawn with Rosenborg in the upcoming round of the UEFA Cup. The following Wednesday, Benfica progressed through the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, with Luisão scoring a single goal in an away win against Académica. The final game of the month came on the 21st, with a 3–0 win to Estrela da Amadora. Two goals within the first ten minutes allowed the team to comfortably manage the remaining time. Camacho later said that Benfica could have scored six or seven goals. This was the team's seventh win in a row, the longest streak of consecutive wins in Camacho's time at Benfica.|$|E

He also criticised the view that the causes of the riots were economic: [...] "Are we seriously saying that so long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our cities will be torn to pieces, that the police in them will be the objects of attack and that we shall destroy our own environment? Of course not". Dame Judith Hart attacked his speech as [...] "an evil incitement to riot". Powell replied: [...] "I am within the judgment of the House, as I am within the judgment of the people of this country, and I am content to stand before either tribunal".|$|E
