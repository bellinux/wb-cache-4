Britten was not enthusiastic {{about the prospect of}} working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved <b>when</b> <b>what</b> came out of the interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, The King's Stamp, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit.|$|E
25|$|The first advance {{came about}} 74 AD, <b>when</b> <b>what</b> is now Baden was invaded {{and in part}} annexed and a road carried from the Roman base on the upper Rhine, Straßburg, to the Danube just above Ulm. The point of the angle was broken off.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish people's {{tendency}} {{to adopt the}} neighboring pagan practices, denounced {{as it had been}} by the Jewish prophets, returned with force during the Talmudic period. However, almost no mythology was borrowed until the Midrashic and Talmudic periods, <b>when</b> <b>what</b> can be described as mysticism emerged in the kabbalistic schools.|$|E

25|$|When the Muslim troops {{arrived at}} the area {{to the east of}} Jordan and learned {{of the size of the}} Byzantine army, they wanted to wait and send for {{reinforcements}} from Medina. Abdullah ibn Rawahah reminded them about their desire for martyrdom and questioned the move to wait <b>when</b> <b>what</b> they desire was awaiting them, so they continued marching towards the waiting army.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Period, {{starting}} 6,000 years ago, {{and ending}} 3,000 years ago, {{was dominated by}} rising sea levels from the melting glaciers in polar regions. This is also <b>when</b> <b>what</b> is called the Laurentian tradition started among Archaic Indians, existing First Nations peoples of the time. Evidence of Archaic Indian burial mounds and other ceremonial sites existing in the Saint John River valley has been uncovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} French literature {{dates from}} the Middle Ages, <b>when</b> <b>what</b> {{is now known as}} modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail. Other authors are known, for example Chrétien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who wrote in Occitan.|$|E

25|$|In 1803 the {{community}} of Johnstown was incorporated as a village. In 1838, Johnstown's county affiliation changed yet again <b>when</b> <b>what</b> by then remained of Mongomery County was divided into two separate counties: Montgomery and Fulton. While the village of Fonda became the new county seat of Montgomery County, Johnstown became the county seat of Fulton County. The village of Johnstown became a city in 1895, becoming separate from the surrounding town.|$|E
25|$|The eight-hour day {{might have}} been {{realised}} for many working people in the US in 1937, <b>when</b> <b>what</b> became the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S. Code Chapter 8) was first proposed under the New Deal. As enacted, the act applied to industries whose combined employment represented about {{twenty percent of the}} US labour force. In those industries, it set the maximum workweek at 40 hours, but provided that employees working beyond 40 hours a week would receive additional overtime bonus salaries.|$|E
25|$|Fantasies {{that are}} {{concerned}} with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer. Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates <b>when</b> <b>what</b> is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{settlement}} in the Livingston Manor area began in 1882 <b>when</b> <b>what</b> was then known as the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad built a depot there. Local farmers could ship their produce to New York City. Some German Jews who had emigrated to the United States {{found their way to}} the Catskills and developed dairy farms. The railroad provided access to the region for city residents who wanted {{to get away from the}} summer heat, leading some farmers and residents to get into the resort and summer camp business. Many resort facilities discriminated against Jews, refusing them as guests.|$|E
25|$|The iPlayer {{received}} {{the approval of}} the BBC Trust on 30 April 2007, and an open beta for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 was launched at midnight on 27 July 2007, where it was announced that only a fixed number of people would be able to sign up for the service, with a controlled increase in users over the summer. The BBC had been criticised for saying that the iPlayer would 'launch' on 27 July 2007, <b>when</b> <b>what</b> was on offer was simply an extension of the beta to an open beta, admitting more users in a controlled manner. This was done reportedly to allow British ISPs and the BBC to gauge the effect of the iPlayer traffic on the Internet within the UK.|$|E
25|$|In the Abhaya-raja-kumara Sutta, the Buddha {{explains}} {{the virtue of}} right speech in different scenarios, based on its truth value, utility value and emotive content. The Tathagata, states Abhaya Sutta, never speaks anything that is unfactual or factual, untrue or true, disagreeable or agreeable, if that is unbeneficial and unconnected to his goals. Further, adds Abhaya Sutta, the Tathagata speaks the factual, the true, if in case it is disagreeable and unendearing, {{only if it is}} beneficial to his goals, but with a sense of proper time. Additionally, adds Abhaya Sutta, the Tathagata, only speaks with a sense of proper time even <b>when</b> <b>what</b> he speaks is the factual, the true, the agreeable, the endearing and what is beneficial to his goals.|$|E

25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular knowledge, and the a priori being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, <b>when</b> <b>what</b> is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before knowledge can be objective, it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E
25|$|The savage, like ourselves, {{feels the}} oppression of his {{impotence}} before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he respects more than Power, {{he is willing to}} prostrate himself before his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship. Pathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture, of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating the jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, <b>when</b> <b>what</b> is most precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be appeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch — as such creeds may be generically called — is in essence the cringing submission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.|$|E

There were also tennis courts, stables, garages and a heated swimming pool together with poolhouse. Biwater, a water-treatment company, purchased it during the 1980s.
