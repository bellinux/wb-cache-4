5|$|There was one {{blockade}} {{force that}} played a particular {{role in the}} campaign, the force deployed to the waters off Rochefort, initially {{under the command of}} Commodore Richard Goodwin Keats. Under Keats, the French squadron under Louis La-Marre-la-Meillerie <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> on 17 July, HMS Mars capturing a frigate and chasing the others into port. In August, Keats was replaced by Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, who was to achieve one of the more notable victories of the year at the Action of 25 September 1806, when a French convoy of seven ships sailing to the West Indies <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> and defeated. Although Hood's force captured four large modern frigates, the French fought hard and Hood himself was seriously wounded by musket fire, losing an arm.|$|E

To avoid an international incident, he directed his boat to leave.|$|E
5|$|In the Indian Ocean theatre {{the loss}} of Prudente was {{compounded}} {{a few weeks later}} by the capture of Forte at the Action of 28 February 1799, which left Sercey with a shortage of available warships.

5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements.

Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus and his son, {{weakened}} by the desertion of the Second Legion due to bribes and promises circulated by Julia Maesa, were defeated on 8 June 218 at the Battle of Antioch by troops commanded by Gannys. Macrinus fled to Italy, disguised as a courier, but <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> near Chalcedon and executed in Cappadocia. His son Diadumenian, sent as a friendly hostage to the Parthian court as a guarantee of peace between the states, was captured at Zeugma and also put to death.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play poorly. On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> {{for the fourth time}} in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts in order to stop the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was poorly done, and traveled only 15yards before going out of bounds.|$|E

5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} wagon master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip on the wagon her father was driving <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a woman, she must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E
5|$|Tech quarterback Sean Glennon's {{first pass}} {{of the new}} possession, long throw downfield, <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> by Boston College defender Jamie Silva. The length of the pass meant that Boston College did not have good field {{position}} following the turnover. After earning a quick first down, the Eagles were stopped and forced to punt. With 2:13 remaining before halftime, the Hokies had one more offensive opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The Boston College drive {{began on}} its own 35-yard line. With little time remaining, Boston College would have to {{complete}} one or more Hail Mary passes. Although the odds of completing one such pass, let alone several, were very low, many Virginia Tech fans remained worried, as Boston College had previously beaten the Hokies in similar circumstances earlier in the season. Matt Ryan's first two passes fell incomplete, and his third <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> by Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi and returned 40yards for a Virginia Tech touchdown.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} {{brought the}} score to 41–26 with 11:29 {{remaining in the}} game. Florida State received the post-touchdown kickoff, then benefited from a 10-yard holding penalty against Virginia Tech. Three subsequent plays failed to gain another first down, however, and on fourth down, a pass by Manuel <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> by Virginia Tech's Davon Morgan {{and returned to the}} Florida State 34-yard line. With 9:29 remaining, Virginia Tech's offense entered the game. The Hokies went three-and-out, but capitalized on the good starting field position by kicking a 43-yard field goal that increased their lead to 44–26.|$|E
5|$|The {{intercepts}} even {{included an}} order from Trotsky to the revolutionary council of war of the Western Front, confirming Tukhachevsky's operational orders, thus giving them {{the authority of the}} supreme chief of the Soviet armed forces. An entire operational order from Tukhachevsky to Budionny <b>was</b> <b>intercepted</b> on 19 August and read on 20 August, stating the tasks of all of Tukhachevsky's armies, of which only the essence had previously been known.|$|E
5|$|The kick bounced out {{of bounds}} at the Clemson 44-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense {{returned}} to the field. On the first play, Vick attempted a pass into the end zone.

The interception was the final play of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech in the lead, 3413.|$|E
