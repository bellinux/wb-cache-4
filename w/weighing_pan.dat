50|$|This is {{the basis}} by which masses are {{determined}} by weighing. In simple spring scales, for example, the force F {{is proportional to the}} displacement of the spring beneath the <b>weighing</b> <b>pan,</b> as per Hooke's law, and the scales are calibrated to take g into account, allowing the mass M to be read off. Assuming the gravitational field is equivalent {{on both sides of the}} balance, a balance measures relative weight, giving the relative gravitation mass of each object.|$|E
5000|$|The balance (also balance scale, {{beam balance}} and {{laboratory}} balance) {{was the first}} mass measuring instrument invented. In its traditional form, it consists of a pivoted horizontal lever with arms of equal lengththe beamand a <b>weighing</b> <b>pan</b> suspended from each arm (hence the plural name [...] "scales for a weighing instrument). The unknown mass is placed in one pan and standard masses of known weight {{are added to the}} other pan until the beam is as close to equilibrium as possible. In precision balances, a more accurate determination of the mass is given by the position of a sliding mass moved along a graduated scale. Technically, a balance compares weight rather than mass, but, in a given gravitational field (such as Earth's gravity), the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, so the standard [...] "weights" [...] used with balances are usually labeled in units of mass (g, kg, etc.).|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{continuous}} measurement of surgical blood loss has been devised {{and has been}} used clinically in some 400 cases. The method combines volumetric measure of the suction loss and gravimetric measure of the sponge loss. The volumetric device automatically deducts the volume of rinse water used and thus measures the amount of blood collected in a metering cylinder. The suction loss scale shows continuously the amount {{of blood in the}} metering cylinder. The gravimetric device requires counting sponges into the <b>weighing</b> <b>pan,</b> and turning a dial scale to deduct the initial weight of the sponges. The volume of blood in the sponges is then read directly on the dial scale. Use of the instrument, which is {{under the supervision of the}} anesthesiologist, adds about two minutes per hour to the time normally required for counting the sponges; and about three minutes per hour is required for tending the volumetric instrument...|$|E
40|$|Abstract � According to International Recommendation OIML R 111, [1], {{the weights}} of nominal values greater than 1 g {{may have a}} {{cylindrical}} shape with a lifting knob.

40|$|The {{availability}} of a rapid method to evaluate the soil water content (U) {{can be an important}} tool to determine the moment to irrigate. The soil areometer consists of an elongated hydrostatic balance with a <b>weighing</b> <b>pan,</b> a graduated neck, a float and a pynometric flask. In this work an areometer was adapted to rapidly measure soil water content without the need of drying the soil. The expression U = (M A - M AD) /(M M -M A) was used to calculate the soil water content. In this equation M M is the mass to level the areometer with the pycnometric flask filled with water, M A the mass to level the areometer with a mass M M of soil in the pycnometer, the volume being completed with water, and similarly M AD the mass added to the pan to level the areometer with a mass M M of dried soil in the pycnometric flask. The convenience of this method is that the values M M and M AD are known. Consequently, the decision on irrigation can be made after a measurement that takes, about, ten minutes. The procedure involves only stirring the soil with water for at least 2 minutes to remove the adhered air. The soil water content data obtained with the areometric method were similar to those obtained weighing the soil before and after drying to constant weight, in an oven at 105 º C...|$|E

40|$|Moving bottom bias in {{acoustic}} Doppler current profiler (ADCP) bottom tracking {{has been}} used as an estimate of apparent bedload velocity (Rennie et al., 2002). However, it remains unknown if the apparent bedload velocity is an unbiased estimate of average bedload particle velocity. This paper presents a controlled laboratory calibration of ADCP bedload velocity, which was performed in the Main Test Channel at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory as part of the National Centre for Earth-Surface Dynamics SedT project. The length of the sediment-recirculating mobile bed test section was 20 m. Both sand-bed (d 50 = 0. 98 mm) and gravel-bed (d 50 = 11. 06 mm) bedload transport experiments were conducted, with five flow rates tested for each sediment. Bottom track data were collected with both 600 and 1200 kHz Rio Grande ADCPs, and over a range of bottom track pulse lengths (&R 20 to &R 40). Actual bedload transport rates were measured using (1) conventional samplers, (2) five automatic <b>weigh</b> <b>pans</b> spread across the channel {{at the end of the}} test section, (3) dune tracking by means of eight sonars, and (4) high speed digital videography. In this paper, measured apparent bedload velocity is compared to bedload transport rate from the <b>weigh</b> <b>pans</b> and dune tracking. In addition, the influence of bottom track pulse length and operating frequency on measured bedload velocity is assessed. The results show correlation between ADCP bottom tracking and measured bedload transport rates, with coefficient of determination (r 2) ranging from 0. 59 to 0. 93 with RMSE (root mean square error) ranging from 0. 059 m/s to 0. 106 m/s for sand bed. For the gravel bed, correlation was found between capture rates and dune tracking with r 2 0. 52 to 0. 97; however, the results were scattered. Initial experimental test results verified that moving bottom bias in acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) bottom tracking can be used as an estimate of bedload velocity. A comparison was achieved successfully with measured flux of capture rates and dune tracking transport rates. The preliminary results were promising for sand bed experiments; however for gravel bed it appears that the flow depths were insufficient for the operation of ADCP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Taking {{into account}} the amount and variety of {{measurements}} involved in scientific, industrial and legal activities that need traceability to the national mass standards of each country, it can be considered that mass standards calibration {{is one of the}} most important activities of the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs). For the determination of the conventional mass, in the calibration of weights of the highest accuracy classes, the subdivision method and its variants are widely used. For the NMIs, it is very important to demonstrate and maintain their capability of applying with good results such methods. In this respect, a calibration procedure for the determination of conventional mass, called “adaptive subdivision method ” was developed in the Mass Laboratory of the Romanian National Institute of Metrology, which can lead to an improvement of CMCs (Calibration and Measurement Capabilities, approved and published in the BIPM database). According to the International Recommendation OIML R 111, the weights of nominal values greater than 1 g may have a cylindrical shape with a lifting knob. Considering this kind of shape and the use of an automatic comparator, with the maximum capacity of 1 kg, the diameter of the <b>weighing</b> <b>pan</b> is too small for placing a group of weights in the range of (500 … 100) g; therefore, the usual subdivision method can not be applied for the calibration of weights. The “adaptive subdivision method”, presented in this paper, allows the cylindrical weights with a lifting knob, having nominal values of (500 … 100) g, to be calibrated using an automatic comparator (which is not equipped with weight support plates). The method can be used for class E 1 weights, where the highest accuracy is required. In this case, the resulting calibration uncertainty for the unknown weights is better than that usually obtained for E 1 masses, being at the level of reference standards...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{difficult}} to weigh the light objects by weighing balance accurately when measured individually. If several light objects are weighed in groups rather than individually then the precision of the estimates increases quite considerably.

Accordingly, design used for weighing is called chemical balance (two <b>pans)</b> <b>weighing</b> design and spring balance (one <b>pan)</b> <b>weighing</b> design.

40|$|Plant ionomes {{and soil}} {{nutrients}} are commonly diagnosed in agronomy using concentration and nutrient ratio ranges. However, both diagnoses are biased by redundancy of information, subcompositional incoherence and non-normal distribution inherent to compositional data, potentially leading to conflicting results and wrong inferences. Our {{objective was to}} present an unbiased statistical approach of plant nutrient diagnosis using a balance concept and mango (Mangifera indica) as test crop. We collected foliar samples at flowering stage in 175 mango orchards. The ionomes comprised 11 nutrients (S, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe). Traditional multivariate methods {{were found to be}} biased. lonomes were thus represented by unbiased balances computed as isometric log ratios (ilr). Soil fertility attributes (pH and bioavailable nutrients) were transformed into balances to conduct discriminant analysis. The orchards differed more from genotype than soil nutrient signatures. A customized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) iterative procedure was developed to classify tissue ionomes between balanced/misbalanced and high/low-yielders. The ROC partitioning procedure showed that the critical Mahalanobis distance of 4. 08 separating balanced from imbalanced specimens about yield cut-off of 128. 5 kg fruit tree(- 1) proved to be a fairly informative test (area under curve = 0. 84 - 0. 92). The [P vertical bar N,S] and [Mn vertical bar Cu,Zn] balances were found to be potential sources of misbalance in the less productive orchards, and should thus be further investigated in field experiments. We propose using a coherent pan balance diagnostic method with median ilr values of top yielders centered at fulcrums of a mobile and the critical Mahalanobis distance as a guide for global nutrient balance. Nutrient concentrations in <b>weighing</b> <b>pans</b> assisted appreciating nutrients as relative shortage, adequacy or excess in balances...|$|R
40|$|In {{most of the}} {{industrial}} world the fractions of older people continuously increase (OECD, 2011). The upcoming demographic change {{is described as a}} threat to societal service. Many societies have to motivate people to work until an older age {{to increase the number of}} working hours in the economy (Eurostat, 2010). Factors important to whether older workers extend their working life are complex, multidisciplinary and involve many different research areas (Nilsson, 2013). Many factors as health, work environment and organisations policies interact and affect the possibility to work in old age. Mental and physical working environment, work pace and skills/competence also associate to if older workers can be a part of an extended working life (Nilsson et al., 2011). Additional, work as an important part of life, working time and management attitude to older workers associated to if older workers want to work beyond 65 years of age. Some studies indicated that people who participate in the working life in an upper age imaging a better mental and physical health (Takashi, 2003). However it seem to depend on demands in their working life, work satisfaction and occupational grade (Westerlund et al., 2009). Economic incentives from salary, in the retirement insurance system and social system also effect the retirement decision (Jokela et al., 2010). Also the family situation an if the older worker plans the retirement with a partner affect the retirement decision (Cobb-Clark & Stillman, 2009). As described the decision to retirement or an extended working life is multifactorial (Nilsson, 2013).

In the first series of experiments flow through the channel was at 100 g/min. at an essentially uniform velocity of 1 ft/sec. Nutrient concentration was varied from 1 mg/l as sucrose. In the last series of experiments, nutrient concentration was held at 5 mg/l and velocity varied at the three stations by altering the height of an overflow weir between 0. 0 and 0. 6 ft, and changing the flow between 25 and 200 g/min. This provided a range of velocities at the station from 0. 09 to 1. 49 ft/sec. The results of attached organism determinations are presented following each experiment and their response to nutrient concentration and velocity summarized in the Discussion. Sphaerotilus-dominated biological flocs were stimulated to bloom proportions within 30 hr after the addition of as little as 1 mg/l of sucrose. Maximum growth was obtained at a concentration of 5 mg/l at velocities from 0. 58 to 1. 49 ft/sec in the temperature range of 20 - 28 [deg] C after around 72 hr of feeding. About this time, detaching and floating material was equivalent to new material being formed, and the term "saturation population" was proposed to describe this condition. The biological floc community was composed chiefly of Sphaerotilus natans, Melosira varians, M. granulata, Nitzschia sp., Navicula sp., Cosmarium sp., Euglena sp., and the protozoans, Bodo sp., Tetrahymena pyriformis, Colipidium colpoda, and Amoeba sp., tendipedid and simuliid larval forms also apparently found a mutualistic association within the flocs.
