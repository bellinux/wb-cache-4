The leasing arrangement dates back to 1999 and was mandated by the European Union in response to competition concerns surrounding BT's Cable TV interests in Milton Keynes and Westminster. Virgin Media completely withdrew its services in Westminster on 31 January 2012, after being unable to upgrade the network and deliver their digital services at a reasonable cost.

40|$|The {{overreaching}} {{purpose of}} this study is to examine in what ways lobbying contributes to democratic policymaking in the European Union. Having limited amount of time, a case study has been conducted with the main purpose to examine <b>what</b> <b>impacts</b> lobbying have on the proposed EU-legislation to lower CO 2 emissions from newly produced cars, in terms of democratic policymaking. The lobby groups in this case being ACEA and T&E. In order to fulfill the purpose a comprehensive research question is formulated: <b>What</b> <b>impacts</b> do ACEA and T&E have on the proposed EU-legislation to lower the CO 2 emissions from newly produced cars, in terms of democratic policymaking? The theory and definitions of democratic policymaking were drawn from Rinus van Schendelen´s book “Machiavelli in Brussels; The Art of Lobbying the EU”. Definitions of different components essential to democratic policymaking were given here and used together with the material on ACEA and T&E to answer the research question. The material was based on documents, press-statements, speeches and publications from the European Union, ACEA and T&E to find out how ACEA and T&E lobbied the proposed legislation. The study has shown mostly positive impacts from ACEA and T&E on the proposed EU-legislation to lower the CO 2 emissions from newly produced cars, in terms of democratic policymaking. For the overreaching purpose the conclusion is that lobbying therefore contributes mostly in a positive way to democratic policymaking in the European Union. This study can in the future be used in further studies to see <b>what</b> <b>impacts</b> lobby groups have on democratic policymaking in the European Union and also in studies concerning how lobby groups carry out their lobbying...|$|R
