40|$|Abstract. Queens of eusocial Hymenoptera are insemi-nated {{only during}} {{a brief period}} before they start to lay eggs. This has {{probably}} been kin-selected because repeated insemination of old queens would normally be against the inclusive fitness interest of their daughter workers. <b>Army</b> <b>ants</b> have been {{considered to be the}} only possible exception to this rule due to their idiosyncratic life-history. We studied two distantly related species of <b>army</b> <b>ants,</b> the <b>African</b> Dorylus (Anomma) molestus and the Neotropical Eciton burchellii and present data from microsatellite genotyping, behavioural observations and sperm counts. We also describe the copulation behaviour of <b>African</b> <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> for the first time. Our results strongly suggest that, contradictory to earlier contentions, <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> queens do not mate repeatedly throughout their life and thus do not constitute an exception among the eusocial Hymenoptera in this respect. Sperm counts for males and queens of both species show that <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> queens have to mate with several males to become fully inseminated. However, sperm limitation by queens is unlikely to have been the prime reason for the evolution of high queen-mating frequencies in this group...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hybridization {{can have}} complex effects on {{evolutionary}} dynamics in ants {{because of the}} combination of haplodiploid sex-determination and eusociality. While hybrid non-reproductive workers {{have been found in}} a range of species, examples of gene-flow via hybrid queens and males are rare. We studied hybridization in East <b>African</b> <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> (Dorylus subgenus Anomma) using morphology, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and nuclear microsatellites. Results While the mitochondrial phylogeny had a strong geographic signal, different species were not recovered as monophyletic. At our main study site at Kakamega Forest, a mitochondrial haplotype was shared between a " Dorylus molestus -like" and a " Dorylus wilverthi -like" form. This pattern is best explained by introgression following hybridization between D. molestus and D. wilverthi. Microsatellite data from workers showed that the two morphological forms correspond to two distinct genetic clusters, with a significant proportion of individuals being classified as hybrids. Conclusions We conclude that hybridization and gene-flow between the two <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> species D. molestus and D. wilverthi has occurred, and that mating between the two forms continues to regularly produce hybrid workers. Hybridization is particularly surprising in <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> because workers have control over which males are allowed to mate with a young virgin queen inside the colony. </p...|$|R

40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} {{altruism}} is only evolutionarily stable {{if it is}} preferentially directed towards relatives, so that any such behaviour towards seemingly unrelated individuals requires scrutiny. Queenless <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> colonies, which have anecdotally been reported to fuse with queenright foreign colonies, are such an enigmatic case. Here we combine experimental queen removal with population genetics and cuticular chemistry analyses to show that colonies of the <b>African</b> <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> Dorylus molestus frequently merge with neighbouring colonies after queen loss. Merging colonies often have no direct co-ancestry, but are on average probably distantly related because of overall population viscosity. The alternative of male production by orphaned workers appears to be so inefficient that residual inclusive fitness of orphaned workers might be maximized by indiscriminately merging with neighbouring colonies to increase their reproductive success. We show that worker chemical recognition profiles remain similar after queen loss, but rapidly change into a mixed colony Gestalt odour after fusion, consistent with indiscriminate acceptance of alien workers that are no longer aggressive. We hypothesize that colony fusion after queen loss might be more widespread, especially in spatially structured populations of social insects where worker reproduction is not profitable...|$|R
40|$|Chimpanzees are {{renowned for}} their use of {{foraging}} tools in harvesting social insects and some populations use tools to prey on aggressive <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> (Dorylus spp.). Tool use in <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation varies across chimpanzee study sites with differences in tool length, harvesting technique, and <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> species targeted. However, surprisingly {{little is known about}} the detailed ecology of <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation. We studied <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea (West Africa), over 10 years (2003 - 2013). We investigated chimpanzee selectivity with regards to <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> prey species. We assessed the temporal variation in army ant-feeding and examined whether <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation was related to rainfall or ripe fruit availability. Moreover, we examined whether chimpanzees showed selectivity regarding plant species used for tool manufacture, as well as the relationship between tool species preference and tool collection distance. Lastly, we measured tool properties and investigated the use of tool sets and composite tools in <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation. Seringbara chimpanzees preyed on one <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> species (D. nigricans) more often than expected based on encounter rates, which may be explained by the overlap in altitudinal distribution between chimpanzees and D. nigricans. <b>Army</b> <b>ant</b> predation was not related to rainfall or fruit availability. Chimpanzees were selective in their choice of tool materials and collected their preferred tool species (Alchornea hirtella) from greater distances than they did other species. Lastly, Seringbara chimpanzees used both tool sets and composite tools (tree perch) in <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation. Tool types (dig vs. dip) differed in width and strength, but not length. Tool composites were found at 40 % of ant-feeding sites. Our study sheds new light on the ecology of <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> predation and provides novel insights into chimpanzee selection of <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> prey and tool species...|$|R

40|$|Army ant-following {{birds that}} inspect bivouacs (temporary nests of nomadic <b>army</b> <b>ants)</b> might provide a novel {{candidate}} for studying elements of mental time travel in animals, namely {{the ability to}} 1) remember {{the time and place}} of specific past events and 2) to use this memory to plan for future actions. <b>Army</b> <b>ant</b> colonies are a rich but unpredictable resource: <b>Army</b> <b>ants</b> do not raid every day, and colonies cycle through periods of high and low raid activity. Birds check bivouacs in the afternoon after feeding on insects that flee the <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> raids and then return to the bivouac the next morning to observe ant activity. If the ants are raiding, the birds will follow the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> {{to the front of the}} raid and begin feeding; if not, the birds must move on to another <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> colony. Do ant-following birds check bivouacs to encode the location in their memory, thereby allowing them to return the next morning to feed again? Ant-following birds may track multiple <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> colonies through space and time to ensure a daily meal on an otherwise scattered and unpredictable resource. We suggest further research to test this hypothesis and provide a framework for investigating whether or not cognitive processes involved in mental time travel play a role in bivouac-checking behavior observed in the field.

40|$|The unique nomadic life-history {{pattern of}} <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> (<b>army</b> <b>ant</b> {{adaptive}} syndrome), including obligate colony fission and strongly male-biased sex-ratios, makes <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> prone to heavily reduced effective population sizes (Ne). Excessive multiple mating by queens (polyandry) {{has been suggested}} to compensate these negative effects by increasing genetic variance in colonies and populations. However, the combined effects and evolutionary consequences of polyandry and <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> life history on genetic colony and population structure have only been studied in a few selected species. Here we provide new genetic data on paternity frequencies, colony structure and paternity skew for the five Neotropical <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> Eciton mexicanum, E. vagans, Labidus coecus, L. praedator and Nomamyrmex esenbeckii; and compare those data among a total of nine <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> species (including literature data). The number of effective matings per queen ranged from about 6 up to 25 in our tested species, and we show that such extreme polyandry is in two ways highly adaptive. First, given the detected low intracolonial relatedness and population differentiation extreme polyandry may counteract inbreeding and low Ne. Second, as indicated by a negative correlation of paternity frequency and paternity skew, queens maximize intracolonial genotypic variance by increasingly equalizing paternity shares with higher numbers of sires. Thus, extreme polyandry {{is not only an}} integral part of the <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> syndrome, but generally adaptive in social insects by improving genetic variance, eve...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Raids by the <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> Neivamyrmex rugulosus (tribe Ecitonini) on a nest {{aggregation}} of the fungus-grow-ing ant Trachymyrmex arizonensis (tribe Attini) {{resulted in}} major brood loss and partial {{destruction of the}} fungus-gar-dens in the attacked nests. T. arizonensis workers attempted to rescue their brood by carrying them to ad-hoc shelters under rocks above ground, but the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> pursued the workers to retrieve much of the brood. Raids on single colonies lasted about half an hour, after which the escaped T. arizonensis workers returned to their nest with any res-cued brood. Raids on single nests occurred repeatedly dur-ing the 24 -hour period the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> swept through the T. arizonensis nest aggregation. Compared to unraided colonies, raided colonies were left with only about 25 % of their brood. <b>Army</b> <b>ant</b> predation thus is {{an important source of}} brood loss to T. arizonensis and probably also to all attine ant species.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of mating systems in eusocial Hymenoptera is constrained because females mate only during {{a brief period}} early in life, whereas inseminated queens and their stored sperm may live for decades. Considerable research effort during recent years has firmly established that obligate multiple mating has evolved only a few times: in Apis honeybees, Vespula wasps, Pogonomyrmex harvester ants, Atta and Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants, the ant Cataglyphis cursor, and {{in at least some}} <b>army</b> <b>ants.</b> Here we provide estimates of queen-mating frequency for New World Neivamyrmex and Old World Aenictus species, which, compared to other <b>army</b> <b>ants,</b> have relatively small colonies and little size polymorphism among workers. To provide the first overall comparative analysis of the {{evolution of}} <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> mating systems, we combine these new results with previous estimates for African Dorylus and New World Eciton <b>army</b> <b>ants,</b> which have very large colonies and considerable worker polymorphism. We show that queens of Neivamyrmex and Aenictus mate with the same high numbers of males (usually ca. 10 – 20) as do queens of <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> species with very large colony sizes. We infer that multiple queen mating is ancestral in <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> and has evolved over 100 million years ago as part of the <b>army</b> <b>ant</b> adaptive syndrome. A comparison of <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> and honeybees suggests that mating systems in these two distantly related groups may have been convergently shaped by strikingly similar selective pressures.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{algorithm}} for Monte Carlo sampling of electronic transitions in trajectory surface hopping (TSH) calculations is the so-called anteater algorithm, which is inefficient for sampling low-probability nonadiabatic events. We present a new sampling scheme (called the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm) for carrying out TSH calculations that is applicable to systems with any strength of coupling. The <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm {{is a form of}} rare event sampling whose efficiency is controlled by an input parameter. By choosing a suitable value of the input parameter the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm can be reduced to the anteater algorithm (which is efficient for strongly coupled cases), and by optimizing the parameter the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm may be efficiently applied to systems with low-probability events. To demonstrate the efficiency of the <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm, we performed atom-diatom scattering calculations on a model system involving weakly coupled electronic states. Fully converged quantum mechanical calculations were performed, and the probabilities for nonadiabatic reaction and nonreactive de-excitation (quenching) were found to be on the order of 10 − 8. For such low-probability events the anteater sampling scheme requires a large number of trajectories (~ 10 10) to obtain good statistics and converged semiclassical results. In contrast by using the new <b>army</b> <b>ants</b> algorithm converged results were obtained by running 10 5 trajectories.
