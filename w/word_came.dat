5|$|Somewhat {{apocryphal}} stories tell of Augustus {{pleading with}} Tiberius to stay, even {{going so far}} as to stage a serious illness. Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of Ostia until <b>word</b> <b>came</b> that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes. Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.|$|E

They then sailed south, arriving in Truk in early July where they would restock their coal supplies. While en route, they received news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the throne}} of Austria-Hungary. On 17 July, the East Asia Squadron arrived in Ponape in the Caroline Islands. Spee now had access to the German radio network and he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia and the Russian mobilization against Austria-Hungary and possibly Germany.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the {{transport}} of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when <b>word</b> <b>came</b> that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed {{to coincide with the}} Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point {{in the middle of the}} North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when Australia collided with sister ship New Zealand twice in three minutes. Australia was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but New Zealand returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving Indefatigable as flagship.|$|E
5|$|Spee {{thereafter}} began {{preparations for}} a cruise to German New Guinea; Scharnhorst departed on 20 June. The two armored cruisers proceeded to Nagasaki, Japan, where they coaled {{in preparation for}} their tour. While en route to Truk in the Caroline Islands, they received news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the throne}} of Austria-Hungary. On 17 July, the East Asia Squadron arrived in Ponape in the Carolines, where the ships remained while tensions steadily rose in Europe. In Ponape, Spee had access to the German radio network, and he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July, followed shortly thereafter by the Russian mobilization—tantamount to a declaration of war—against Austria-Hungary and possibly Germany. On 31 July, <b>word</b> <b>came</b> that the German ultimatum that Russia demobilize its armies was set to expire; Spee ordered his ships' crews to prepare for war. On 2 August, Wilhelm II ordered German mobilization against Russia and its ally, France. Following Germany's violation of neutral Belgium during its invasion of France, Britain declared war on Germany.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{focus on}} France {{served as a}} way for Southey to discuss his {{feelings}} about the French Revolution. In particular, Southey was upset that the British were calling men from their farms to serve as a militia during the time. In terms of the French, Southey did not support Robespierre and the others who followed him in France. However, he did support the idea of the French Republic. When he heard of Marie Antoinette's execution in October 1793, Southey told his friend Bedford that he condemned the action although he held to his Republican beliefs. However, he was further upset when <b>word</b> <b>came</b> that Brissot, the Girondin leader, was executed. This caused him to believe that all of the countries were equally bad, except the Republican United States, which he hoped to make his home. In 1794, many of Southey's feelings on Robespierre's involvement in these actions were included in both Joan of Arc and the Fall of Robbespierre, which followed after Robespierre's own execution. However, Southey had by then become very radical and believed that Robespierre was a great man who only helped mankind in his actions.|$|E

25|$|If a <b>word</b> <b>came</b> from a {{language}} using the Latin script, {{they are only}} respelled if they have become an integral, widely known part of Hungarian language (e.g. laser > lézer, manager > menedzser).

There is no hard and consistent rule and many widely used terms are written in the original spelling, e.g. musical or show. Certain Phrases from foreign languages are always written in their original form, even if the individual words would be respelled in isolation, e.g. tuberkulózis cf. tuberculosis bronchialis.|$|E
25|$|In 1730, Duck {{combined}} some of {{the poetic}} pieces he had been writing and wrote The Thresher's Labour, a poem that described the difficulty of field work. The poem was celebrated throughout London society, and he soon wrote The Shunammite, which reflected Duck's piety and religious imagination. The poet was taken to meet Queen Caroline, and, while he was there, <b>word</b> <b>came</b> {{of the death of}} his wife, but Clarke kept the news from Duck until after the interview with the Queen.

Some public horrea functioned somewhat like banks, where valuables could be stored, but the most important class of horrea were those where foodstuffs such as grain and olive oil were stored and distributed by the state.|$|E
25|$|Once the Franks family {{received}} the ransom note the following morning, Leopold called {{a second time}} and dictated {{the first set of}} ransom payment instructions. The intricate plan stalled almost immediately when a nervous family member forgot the address of the store where he was supposed to receive the next set of directions; and it was abandoned entirely when <b>word</b> <b>came</b> that a man named Tony Minke had found the boy's body. Their kidnapping ruse exposed, Leopold and Loeb destroyed the stolen typewriter and burned a robe used to move the body.

25|$|Hadrian was at Antioch in Syria when <b>word</b> <b>came</b> through of {{the death}} of Trajan. But he was in no {{position}} to return to Rome, as he was advised that Quadratus Bassus, ordered by Trajan to protect the new Dacian territories north of the Danube, had died there while on campaign. As a result of taking several legions and numerous auxiliary regiments with him to Parthia, Trajan had left Dacia and the remaining Danubian provinces below strength. The Roxolani, angry over a Roman decision to cease the payments to which Trajan had agreed, allied themselves with the Iazyges and both tribes revolted against Rome. Therefore, Hadrian dispatched the armies from the east ahead of him, and departed Syria {{as soon as he was}} able.|$|E
25|$|God's <b>word</b> <b>came</b> to Jeremiah to {{say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations.

Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
25|$|After the {{recapture}} of Schenkenschans in April 1636, the Spanish commander, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Spain, {{shifted his}} focus to France. This {{required that the}} Army of Flanders {{move away from the}} Dutch border; therefore the military threat Spain posed to the Dutch Republic lessened. In the summer of 1636 the Cardinal-Infante reached as far as Corbie, but this city was retaken by the French in November, {{and at the end of}} the year Spain had lost most of its gains. For the campaign of 1637 Olivares planned a renewed offensive against France. In Brussels the Cardinal-Infante actually would have preferred an offensive against the Dutch, but reluctantly agreed to take part in the three-pronged invasion of France that summer (the other invasions would come from Catalonia and Lombardy). He therefore started to mass his forces on the French border when <b>word</b> <b>came</b> that the Dutch had suddenly invested the city of Breda with a besieging army of 18,000.|$|E
