5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third <b>World</b> <b>politics</b> {{increased}} dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions {{were important to}} the expansion of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} <b>world</b> <b>politics.</b> Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E
5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to <b>world</b> <b>politics,</b> science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed <b>world</b> <b>politics.</b> Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on <b>world</b> <b>politics</b> and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained {{international}} renown for its lavish {{dinner parties}} and galas, {{often at the}} center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it {{played a significant role in}} <b>world</b> <b>politics</b> and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in <b>world</b> <b>politics</b> {{at the expense of}} Europe), the FPÖ were more positively inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of the}} Iraq War; he subsequently condemned US foreign policy and derided George W. Bush for not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised US foreign policy as promoted by Bush, which it saw as leading to increased levels of violence in the Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in <b>world</b> <b>politics</b> up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, {{in honor}} of the 50th anniversary of the {{creation}} of Candide, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris produced a new production under the direction of Robert Carsen. The production was to move to Milan's Teatro alla Scala in 2007 and to the English National Opera in 2008. The production transforms the proscenium into a giant 1950s-era TV set, and has Voltaire, appearing as the narrator, changing channels between certain scenes. Carsen sets the action in a 1950s/1960s world, with an American slant commenting on contemporary <b>world</b> <b>politics.</b> This production was filmed and broadcast on Arte. For an open-house day in French opera houses on February 17, 2007, this video was projected in high definition on a screen filling the proscenium of the Théâtre du Châtelet.|$|E
