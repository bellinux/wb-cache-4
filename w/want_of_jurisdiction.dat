25|$|The {{grant of}} {{probation}} {{may be made}} on the court's own motion. Because the power of pardoning offenders is vested in the President of the United States only, probation is not considered a pardon of any kind, but rather an authorized form of punishment of mild nature, and unlike a pardon, it cannot be refused by the convicted person. Federal courts have an inherent power to reduce a sentence, but without Congressional authorization, a federal court has no power to suspend the execution of a sentence which it has imposed or to place the defendant on probation. When this was first announced by the Supreme Court in 1916 in the case of Ex Parte United States, an abrupt halt was brought to a practice which, by then, had become widespread in the federal system, and which had existed for more than 70 years. A sentence for a period of one year with an order that, after the defendant had served three months of his sentence, probation was to be granted on the condition that the defendant abide by laws, was void for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> since it was in effect an exercise of pardoning power.|$|E

50|$|Several {{days after}} her appointment, Reyno {{commenced}} separate wrongful-death actions against Piper and Hartzell in the Superior Court of California, claiming negligence and strict liability. The defendants first removed to federal district court in California invoking diversity jurisdiction. Piper then sought to transfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to the Middle District of Pennsylvania on grounds of convenience because Piper engaged in business in Pennsylvania. Hartzell moved to dismiss for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>jurisdiction,</b> or in the alternative to transfer {{the case to the}} Middle District of Pennsylvania under 28 U.S.C. § 1631, where Hartzell's business with Piper supported jurisdiction. The district court transferred. With both cases now moved to federal district court in Pennsylvania, both defendants then sought to dismiss the case on grounds of forum non conveniens. The District Court granted these motions in October 1979. The Third Circuit reversed, on the ground that dismissal for forum non conveniens is never appropriate where the law of the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiff.|$|R

40|$|When private {{international}} law lawyers discuss jurisdiction, focus is typically placed primarily on personal jurisdiction, and secondarily on subject matter jurisdiction. This article seeks to demonstrate {{that there is a}} third matter – what we can call scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> or perhaps scope <b>of</b> remedial <b>jurisdiction</b> – that needs to be considered. Scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> relates to the appropriate geographical scope of orders rendered by a court that has personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction.

50|$|In {{the federal}} system, courts may only decide actual cases or controversies; {{it is not}} {{possible}} to request the federal courts to review a law without at least one party having legal standing to engage in a lawsuit.

5000|$|In a {{unanimous}} opinion authored by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court dismissed the writ of certiorari for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Rehnquist {{wrote that the}} Florida Supreme Court's decision did not fit any of the categories where the Court [...] "treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although there were further proceedings {{to take place in}} the state court." [...] Thus, the Court concluded that the Florida Supreme Court's decision was not final. This was partly based on a doctrine from the Cox decision which decided that certain decisions were not 'final' when the trial proceedings had not been completed.|$|E

The Supreme Court reversed this decision for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The jurisdictional barrier was then removed by statute, and Seminole Nation of Oklahoma filed a second amended petition in the Court of Claims, reasserting the six claims previously denied by the Supreme Court. The Court of Claims denied three claims entirely, allowed one in full and two in part. Seminole Nation was awarded $18,388.30. However, the United States was entitled to gratuity offsets in the amount of $705,337.33, and as such, the second amended petition was dismissed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on a petition challenging the lower court's decision on each of the five claims disallowed in whole or in part. The Court also agreed to review the items which the Court of Claims included in the list of gratuity offsets.|$|E

50|$|Dividing 4 to 4 {{over the}} issue of jurisdiction, the U.S. Supreme court {{dismissed}} the case for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> so the Vermont Supreme Court ordered Holmes release even though five of the eight Justices denied the issue of Jennison’s authority, thus enunciating the principle that the Constitution gives state officers no power to take any independent actions concerned with foreign governments. Barbour was one of the four Justices who disagreed with the Chief Justice’s ruling. Barbour believed that because “there is no treaty on the subject of surrendering fugitives,” being forged between state and foreign country, then the returning of fugitives to Canada did not violate a power granted to the federal government by the Constitution, and therefore the “authority, exercised by the Governor of Vermont, is not repugnant to the power of making treaties in its dormant state because it not the mere existence of power but its exercise which is incompatible with the exercise of the same power by the states.” Because the Governor was exercising within his own rights without infringing on the rights of others and that the Constitution did not explicitly define the affairs of states with foreign countries, then Governor Jennison was completely within his rights to order the extradition.|$|E

40|$|Same-sex {{couples who}} entered into marriage, or marriage-like {{relationships}} {{in states that}} recognize such relationships, have been denied divorce or dissolution of those relationships by other states. These states refuse to recognize same-sex marriages, or their cognates, on constitutional or statutory grounds generally for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> This Article argues that all such denials are unconstitutional. The argument {{is based on a}} doctrinal trifecta anchored by the law of three cases: Williams v. North Carolina, which deconstructed marriage; Boddie v. Connecticut, which swept away impediments to court access in family law matters, particularly divorce, where the state retains a monopoly on dissolution of a fundamental relationship; and Hughes v. Fetter, which required states to open their courts to narrowly similar juridical analogues from other states pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Importantly, Justice Black identified “the national policy of the Full Faith and Credit Clause” in Hughes, a meta-policy that informs the Clause and controls its meaning and application beyond the micro-issues of enforcement, which restricts application of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) in these circumstances...|$|E

However {{the process by which}} the rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and recognition were formulated has certain weaknesses. In particular, the rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> are derived from national rules with a long history, dating back to times when patterns of commerce were entirely different.
