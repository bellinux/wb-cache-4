50|$|The Interceptor sported racing bike {{fairings}} {{that shaped}} {{the future for}} modern sport bikes. The tank was 5.8 gallons and was shaped to keep the rider's legs tucked in to eliminate air drag. The new front fairing replaced the cafe racer headlight with an aerodynamic fiberglass fairing to push the air over the rider's helmet. The lower cowl produced down force to push the 551 pound bike to the road. The front <b>wheel</b> <b>fairing</b> was designed to eliminate debris from striking the bike and causing damage. The 32.3 inch seat height provided comfort for a long trip without sacrificing the track bike stance.|$|E

50|$|The {{two seats}} {{are in a}} tandem {{arrangement}} with dual controls, adjustable rudder pedals and seatbacks. The fuselage consists of a tubular sandwich and thus offers passive safety with low weight. The two-piece, mid-set, cantilever wing is a single-spar glass-fiber construction without flaps, but with upper side Schempp-Hirth-type air brakes. The wingtips curve downward, providing tip skids that allow take-offs without a wing helper (small wheel added with ASK-21 mi). The T-tail possesses a fixed horizontal stabilizer and an elevator with spring trim and automatic connections. The undercarriage consists {{of two or three}} fixed wheels. The main wheel lies behind the centre of gravity and has a hydraulically operated disc brake. Checking the tire pressure is hindered by the need for removing the <b>wheel</b> <b>fairing.</b> The tail unit has a rubber skid or a tailwheel.|$|E

50|$|Another type of wheel cover, {{the static}} <b>wheel</b> <b>fairing,</b> was {{introduced}} by BBS for Ferrari at the British Grand Prix {{to act as a}} brake cooling aid for front wheels whilst remaining stationary the wheel itself with one part being cut out at a 27° angle to enable hot air to escape and thus became adopted by every team. The wheel covers were banned from use in F1 from 2010 after incidents where they broke loose in races. To get around the ban, Ferrari used a detachable integral aero device made from the same magnesium material as the wheel itself, which consisted of double concentric rings of different diameter. As parts of cars how have to be homologated, its rivals were unable to copy this device. Its use became eliminated when the FIA revised the regulations for 2011 to prohibit wheel materials in certain exclusion zones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experimental flight test vibration measurements and structural inspections {{performed by the}} Federal Aviation Administration`s Airworthiness Assurance NDI Validation Center (AANC) at Sandia National Laboratories and the US Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC). Structural and aerodynamic changes induced by mounting a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system on a USCG HC- 130 H aircraft are described. The FLIR adversely affected the air flow characteristics and structural vibration on the external skin of the aircraft`s right main wheel well fairing. Upon initial discovery of skin cracking and visual observation of skin vibration in flight by the FLIR, a baseline flight without the FLIR was conducted and compared to other measurements with the FLIR installed. Nondestructive inspection procedures were developed to detect cracks in the skin and supporting structural elements and document the initial structural condition of the aircraft. Inspection results and flight test vibration data revealed that the FLIR created higher than expected flight loading and was the possible source of the skin cracking. The Coast Guard performed significant structural repair and enhancement on this aircraft, and additional in-flight vibration measurements were collected on the strengthened area both with and without the FLIR installed. After three months of further operational FLIR usage, the new aircraft skin with the enhanced structural modification was reinspected and found {{to be free of}} flaws. Additional US Coast Guard HC- 130 H aircraft are now being similarly modified to accommodate this FLIR system. Measurements of in-flight vibration levels with and without the FLIR installed, and {{both before and after the}} structural enhancement and repair were conducted on the skin and supporting structure in the aircraft`s right main <b>wheel</b> <b>fairing.</b> Inspection results and techniques developed to verify the aircraft`s structural integrity are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of high wing {{loadings}} on large high performance airplanes has emphasized the problem of take-off. In many cases the allowable gross weight is limited primarily by take-off considerations. The {{most effective way to}} decrease the take-off distance without decreasing wing loading is to increase the available thrust during take-off run and initial climb. The use of auxiliary jet propulsion has been proposed as a means of accomplishing this and considerable interest has been aroused in its development. A program of development and research on jet reaction motors using various types of fuels has been undertaken at the California Institute of Technology during the past year. The development of a jet motor using solid fuel (powder) has reached the stage where it is practical to begin actual flight test experiments with assisted take-offs. For this purpose the U. S. Army Air Corps has made available a YO- 55 (Ercoupe) Airplane for installation of auxiliary jet propulsion units and for flight testing. This report is concerned with a study of the various problems involved in the use of jet propulsion on an airplane, and the design of a practical installation on the YO- 55 airplane. After a study of the various factors involved, it was decided to use two jet propulsion assemblies each containing three separate jet motors of approximately 25 lbs. thrust. The assemblies are mounted under the center section of the wing, one on each side just inboard of the main landing <b>wheel</b> <b>fairing.</b> The motors are so designed that in case of an excessive pressure build-up, the nozzle will fly off to the rear {{and the rest of the}} motor will be propelled forward clear of the airplane. Particular emphasis was placed on safety of the pilot and the airplane structure. ...|$|E

The inspection procedure locates cracks as small as 10. 2 millimeters in length at 2. 54 mm below the skin surface at raised fastener sites. The test procedure developed baseline three USCG aircraft.

5000|$|Stuttgart Spring Festival (in German called Stuttgarter Frühlingsfest or {{sometimes}} vernacular Cannstatter Wasen or just Wasen) is an annual fair {{that takes place}} in the German city of Stuttgart between the middle of April and the beginning of May. The festival takes place on the Cannstatter Wasen, traditional fairgrounds in Stuttgart's Bad Cannstatt district. It is slightly smaller than the festival in the autumn (and therefore occasionally also called the [...] "small Wasen"), but it is the largest spring festival in Europe.

5000|$|The {{reversed}} gambler's fallacy {{may appear}} to apply {{in the story of}} Joseph Jagger, who hired clerks to record the results of roulette wheels in Monte Carlo. He discovered that one wheel favored nine particular numbers, and was able to win large sums of money by betting on them until the casino started rebalancing the roulette wheels daily. In this situation, the observation of the wheel's behavior provided information about the physical properties of the wheel rather than its [...] "probability" [...] in some abstract sense, a concept which is the basis of both the gambler's fallacy and its reversal. Even a biased wheel's past results will not affect future results, but the results can provide information about what sort of results the wheel tends to produce. However, if it is known for certain that the <b>wheel</b> is completely <b>fair,</b> then past results provide no information about future ones.|$|R
5000|$|As an example, {{consider}} a roulette wheel that has landed on red in three consecutive spins. An onlooker might apply {{the law of}} averages to conclude that on its next spin it must (or at least {{is much more likely}} to) land on black. Of course, the wheel has no memory and its probabilities do not change according to past results. So even if the wheel has landed on red in ten or a hundred consecutive spins, the probability that the next spin will be black is still no more than 48.6% (assuming a <b>fair</b> European <b>wheel</b> with only one green zero; it would be exactly 50% if there were no green zero and the <b>wheel</b> were <b>fair,</b> and 47.4% for a <b>fair</b> American <b>wheel</b> with one green [...] "0" [...] and one green [...] "00"). Similarly, there is no statistical basis for the belief that lottery numbers which haven't appeared recently are due to appear soon. (There is some value in choosing lottery numbers that are, in general, less popular than others — not because they are any more or less likely to come up, but because the largest prizes are usually shared among {{all of the people who}} chose the winning numbers. The unpopular numbers are just as likely to come up as the popular numbers are, and in the event of a big win, one would likely have to share it with fewer other people.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{steered wheels}} on a velomobile {{will hit the}} fairing if steered sharply enough. Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for {{aerodynamics}} and width. Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse turning circle than an equivalent unfaired cycle. In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle. Steering only the rear <b>wheel(s)</b> would avoid <b>fairing</b> interference, {{but it is hard}} to build a stable vehicle using only rear-wheel steering. The Velayo uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it was produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles steered all wheels; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels. However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.|$|R
