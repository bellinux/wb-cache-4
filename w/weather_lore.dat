5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various <b>weather</b> <b>lore</b> over the centuries.|$|E

Our null hypothesis is as follows: known <b>weather</b> <b>lores</b> have a higher success rate of forecast than unknown <b>weather</b> <b>lores.</b> We worked on the assumption, that in the general awareness remain mainly <b>weather</b> <b>lores</b> that works (passed on from generation to generation as a result of long-term learning process). That should have clarified whether not working <b>weather</b> <b>lores</b> are used any more. We verified <b>weather</b> <b>lores</b> on the basis of hydro- meteorological data for the period 1972 - 2002. We used several measure criteria. Each criteria was tested with Student's t-test. For all criteria, we observed that at the 5 % level of significance we could not reject the hypothesis of equal values of known and unknown <b>weather</b> <b>lores.</b> It was not confirmed our hypothesis that known <b>weather</b> <b>lores</b> have a higher success rate of predictions.

5000|$|Cirrocumulus appears almost {{exclusively}} with cirrus some {{way ahead of}} a warm front and is a reliable forecaster that the weather is about to change.

[...] The particular shape and orientation of the crystals are responsible for the types of halo observed. Light is reflected and refracted by the ice crystals and may split into colors because of dispersion. The crystals behave like prisms and mirrors, refracting and reflecting sunlight between their faces, sending shafts of light in particular directions. For circular halos, the preferred angular distance are 22 and 46 degrees from the ice crystals which create them.Atmospheric phenomena such as halos have been used as part of <b>weather</b> <b>lore</b> as an empirical means of weather forecasting, with their presence indicating an approach of a warm front and its associated rain.|$|E

(1963) to avoid confusion with the mathematical us-age of “singularities. ” These features are commonly identified as consistently observed warm or cold de-partures from the annual march of temperature, or as wet or dry departures from some background an-nual precipitation trend. Historically, the most studied singularity in Euro-pean <b>weather</b> <b>lore</b> is an alleged cold period during 11 – 14 May, popularly known as the Ice Saints, named after the last killing frosts that seemingly tend to oc-cur on days dedicated to Saints Mamertus, Pancras, Servatius, and Boniface on the ecclesiastical calendar (e. g., Buchan 1869; Talman 1919; Huschke 1959).

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 278 p. This study traces the witch and the demon figures from folklore through Thomas Hardy's fiction and poetry, exploring the possible meanings behind the figures and explaining the figures' relationships to sexual conflicts in the works. Seeing the figures as nanifest expressions of human sexual aggression or as projections from the unconscious in what Jung terms anima/animus archetypes, the study discusses the tyrannical action perceived by the character who is the figure's sexual counterpart. The study categorizes both the witch and the demon into three manifestations: women appear as the witch in love, the malignant witch, the white witch; men appear as the demon in love, the demon lover, the designing demon. In love, the figures stand {{at the center of the}} novels, the short stories, and even the poems signifying sexual tyranny. The white witches (wise women or conjurers) are humble descendants of the magician, the wizard, or the sorceress, carrying wisdom from the ancients to mediate conflicts. They also dispense knowledge of medicinal plants and herbs to heal the body naturally. The malignant witch, on the other hand, represents the destructive emotions of jealousy, resentment, and greed. The witch's counterpart, the demon, possesses victims through music, the dance, or the music of words, often adding fantasy dimensions to the tales. Ordinary men, pursuing ambitious goals, prove destructive when they, in turn, are possessed by demonic impulses. Discussions of other folkloric elements include Hardy's use of numerology and superstitions about shape-shifting, omens, or <b>weather</b> <b>lore,</b> concentrating on those superstitions and folk customs only as they pertain to the major figures. Hardy envisioned and projected his figures from the mind: the energies from the unconscious personified and projected onto real men and real women. Therefore, this study employs Jungian concepts in pursuing its search for Hardy's purpose behind the folkloric figures...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Studies on ancient navigation have traditionally derived their information from ancient geographers and the authors of various periploi ("sailings around"), a type of coast-pilot written in and after the fifth century B. C. The resultant paradigm portrays a scene in which ships voyage from headland to headland, never traversing the open sea, and rarely, if ever, sail intentionally past sunset. The investigation presented here, however, offers a different scenario, one which characterizes ancient seafarers as both naturalists and pragmatists, devoted to accurate wayfinding not only on coasting voyages, but also on the open sea. To this end they became students of their maritime environment, making a science of winds (dividing and subdividing them into a wind "compass") and wind prediction, and compiling a body of <b>weather</b> <b>lore</b> that still rings true today. At times, contrary to ancient conventions and modern interpretation of the sailing season, their confidence emboldened them to extend their activity into the winter months. They acquired wayfinding clues by observing the behavior of shore-sighting birds and birds in their natural environment. They also invented aids to navigation: the crow's nest, a Late Bronze Age innovation, extended the viewer's horizon by several miles and helped ships avoid dangerous reefs on approaches to land; the sounding lead indicated depth and type of bottom; man-made seamarks and landmarks (temples, shrines, funeral mounds, towers, and lighthouses) offered invaluable position-finding information. Sailing past sunset, a very-well documented practice in antiquity, presented a host of additional challenges and hazards. Their response, quite logically, was {{to make sense of the}} night sky. Systems of celestial navigation eventually evolved, facilitated by the Mediterranean's clear summer skies: the circumpolar constellations offered a convenient orientation; their height above the horizon provided rough positions north or south of predetermined reference points; and evidence suggests that ancient seafarers utilized guide-stars and "star paths" (a Polynesian practice) to point them in the direction of their destination. In addition to presenting the subject, there is also a case to be made that ancient seafarers invented wayfinding instruments and practices that allowed them to sail safely upon the open sea, day or night...|$|E
