25|$|According to Henry, {{life can}} never {{be seen from the}} exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and {{experiences}} itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> life itself, but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them. In the same way, it is impossible to see another person's soul with the eyes or to perceive it {{at the end of a}} scalpel.|$|E
25|$|The {{notebook}} Kid receives {{already has}} writing throughout, {{but only on}} the right hand pages. The left hand pages are blank. Glimpses of the text in the notebook, however, are extremely close to passages in Dhalgren itself, as if the notebook were an alternate draft of the novel. Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of Dhalgren. It is here in Chapter II that Kid begins using the blank pages of the notebook to compose poems. The novel describes {{the process of creating}} the poems—the emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself—at length and several times. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> the actual poems, however, in their final form. Kid soon revises or removes any line that does appear in the text.|$|E
500|$|In October 2015, Smith {{was cast}} in the [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] of Masters for the second season, having previously worked with Butters and Fazekas on their television series Resurrection. Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it. Maybe <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> him again or maybe we see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E

[...] He then whispers to her what he really wants, causing Carol to smack him with a giant hand created by her ring.|$|E
2500|$|A Brand New You {{was well}} {{received}} by Canadian film critics. In his review for the NOW Magazine, Norman Wilner praised the cast: [...] "the characters are so weirdly specific {{and the actors}} who play them so invested that it kind of works in spite of itself" [...] he refers to the production quality's budget related shortcomings. The film subsequently appeared in a [...] "worth a watch [...] " [...] year end list of Now Magazine in 2015. On his Film Corner blog critic Greg Klymkiw offers the praise [...] "by generating characters and situations <b>we</b> <b>NEVER</b> <b>see</b> in the movies {{is one of the}} ways the picture succeeds". All of the critical writing on the film consistently praises the unusual premis in the film and the commitment of the directors to their vision and of the actors to their characters.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory is}} that Joan is {{actually}} a comic figure, and the huge alterations in her character are supposed to evoke laughter. Michael Taylor, for example, argues, [...] "A fiendish provenance replaces a divine one in , a scene that reduces Joan to a comic, bathetic dependency on shifty representatives of the underworld." [...] In line with this thinking, it is worth pointing {{out that in the}} 1981 BBC Television Shakespeare adaptation, Joan, and the French in general, are treated predominantly as comic figures. Joan (Brenda Blethyn), Alençon (Michael Byrne), the Bastard (Brian Protheroe), Reignier (David Daker) and Charles (Ian Saynor) are treated as buffoons for the most part, and there is no indication of any malevolence (significantly, when Joan’s fiends abandon her, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> them, we simply see her talking to empty air). Examples of the comic treatment of the characters are found during the battle of Orléans, where Joan is ludicrously depicted as defending the city from the entire English army single-handed, whilst Talbot stands by incredulously watching his soldiers flee one after another. Another example appears in Act 2, Scene 1, as the five of them blame one another for the breach in the watch at Orléans that allowed the English back into the city. Their role as comic figures is also shown in Act 3, Scene 2. After Joan has entered Rouen and the others stand outside waiting for her signal. Charles is shown sneaking through a field holding a helmet with a large plume up {{in front of his face}} in an effort to hide.|$|E

2500|$|A.O. Scott {{writing in}} The New York Times came to believe, [...] "The {{relentless}} {{attention to the}} sheer awfulness of war, which is the film's great strength, is also something of a shortcoming. Mr. Gitai reproduces the numb horror of wading through fields of gore almost too well: the self-protective response is to shut down your emotions, as the characters do. Kippur immerses you in violence and agony, but it may leave you with a curious feeling of detachment." [...] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, felt Kippur was [...] "almost abstract in its portrait of confusion. Long, numbing scenes of soldiers rushing through the war zone with the wounded and returning for more are accompanied by an overwhelming soundtrack of tanks, helicopters and explosions." [...] He also reserved praise for director Gitai, saying he [...] "captures a chaotic portrait of the war with no glory, only the confusion, fear, and fatigue of a tour under fire." [...] Author G.A. of Time Out called the film [...] "impressive" [...] while remarking [...] "Gitai's autobiographically inspired account of the harrowing experiences of a first-aid team {{in the aftermath of}} Syria and Egypt's surprise attack on Israel in October 1973 typically features long, sinuous takes to chart the way in which patriotic enthusiasm is steadily eroded and replaced by fatigue and disillusionment." [...] In a mixed review, Fred Camper writing for the Chicago Reader felt director [...] "Gitai plunges the viewer into the reality of modern warfare, in which the enemy is often invisible – <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>see</b> the Syrians in Kippur – and battle lines are often unclear." [...] Jack Mathews writing for the NY Daily News, believed that instead of [...] "heightening our sense of empathy, we become numbed by the repetition" [...] of the film.|$|E
