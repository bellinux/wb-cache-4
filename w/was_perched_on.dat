5|$|The symbol {{used by the}} French rugby {{team was}} a great success, and was later adopted by the French {{delegation}} at the Olympic Games of 1920 where the rooster <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> five Olympic rings. The rooster has since become a well-known symbol of French teams. French players are sometimes called les coqs and some French supporters {{have been known to}} release roosters on the playing field before games.|$|E
25|$|The Horus {{name was}} usually {{written in a}} serekh, a {{representation}} of a palace façade. The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside this representation of a palace. Typically {{an image of the}} falcon God Horus <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> top of or beside it.|$|E
25|$|According to {{traveler}} John Muir, on {{his visit}} to Diomede Islands in the 1880s they found the natives eager to trade away everything they had. The village <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> the steep rocky slope of the mountain which drops at once sheer into deep water. The huts were mostly built of stone with skin roofs. They looked like mere stoneheaps, black dots on the snow at a distance, with whalebone posts set up and framed at the top to lay their canoes beyond the dogs that would otherwise eat them.|$|E

25|$|The next {{match was}} the Tag Team Turmoil {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. Tajiri and William Regal were the champions heading into the match. The teams would come out at random, and it was The Heart Throbs who entered first, with the champions Tajiri and Regal coming out next. Tajiri {{utilized}} a lot of kicks and then locked in the Tarantula. The Heart Throbs then kept Tajiri isolated, but Tajiri pinned Antonio with a sunset flip. Simon Dean and Maven entered into the match next, trying to pick apart the weakened Tajiri. Their inclusion in the match did not last very long as Regal made the tag and cleaned house, putting Dean away with a knee to the head. La Résistance came in next, but Regal and Tajiri tried to fight back. Regal was then rolled up, {{with a handful of}} tights, eliminating he and Tajiri and guaranteeing new champions. Rosey and The Hurricane were the last two men to enter the match. Hurricane was then smashed on the turnbuckle post. Hurricane and Rosey got the pin when Hurricane leapt off the shoulders of Rosey, who <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> the top rope to grab the win.|$|E
500|$|Gorgosaurus shared {{its general}} body plan {{with all other}} tyrannosaurids. Its massive head <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> {{the end of an}} S-shaped neck. In {{contrast}} to its large head, its forelimbs were very small. The forelimbs had only two digits, although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens, the vestigial remains of the third digit seen in other theropods. Gorgosaurus had four digits on each hindlimb, including a small first toe (hallux) which did not contact the ground. Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods. The largest known Gorgosaurus femur measured [...] long. In several smaller specimens of Gorgosaurus, the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast-running animals. The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips.|$|E
500|$|The massive {{skull of}} Albertosaurus, which <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> a short, S-shaped neck, was about [...] {{long in the}} largest adults. Wide {{openings}} in the skull (fenestrae) reduced {{the weight of the}} head while also providing space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth, Gorgosaurus at least 62. Unlike most theropods, Albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont, with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The premaxillary teeth {{at the tip of the}} upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in cross section. Like with Tyrannosaurus, the maxillary (cheek) teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of Albertosaurus was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons. Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.|$|E

2500|$|One view {{holds that}} [...] "Nazareth" [...] {{is derived from}} one of the Hebrew words for 'branch', namely ne·ṣer, נֵ֫צֶר, and alludes to the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1, 'from (Jesse's) roots a Branch (netzer) will bear fruit'. One view {{suggests}} this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile. Alternatively, the name may derive from the verb na·ṣar, נָצַר, [...] "watch, guard, keep,"Francis Brown, S. R. Driver, Charles A. Briggs, The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon (1906/2003), p. 665. [...] and understood either in the sense of [...] "watchtower" [...] or [...] "guard place", implying the early town <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as 'preserved, protected' in reference to its secluded position. The negative references to Nazareth in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town's name to prophecy.|$|E
