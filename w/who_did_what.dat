25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters.

David Thomson wrote about [...] "the problem in assessing [...] career: <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> in their collaboration? And what is Donen's real standing as a director?" [...] Thomson remarked that [...] "nothing in his career suggests that Gene Kelly could have filmed himself singing in the rain with the exhilaration of Donen's retreating crane shot." [...] However set reports state that Kelly rode the camera boom between shots and during camera set-ups. Donen stated that [...] "by the time you hash it through {{from beginning to end}} ten million times, you can't remember <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> except in a few instances where you remember getting an idea." [...] Composer Saul Chaplin said that [...] "Gene was the prime mover and Stanley an eager and talented pupil."
