5|$|There {{could conceivably}} be other planets {{in the system}} that do not transit the star, but they <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> {{detectable}} by the effects of their gravity on {{the motion of the}} visible planets (much as how Neptune was discovered).|$|E

The {{defenders}} of the post <b>would</b> <b>only</b> have <b>been</b> slaughtered, and the assailants might have rushed across the drawbridge before {{it could have been}} raised. The post is of little importance save to defend the castle against a sudden surprise, and <b>would</b> <b>only</b> have <b>been</b> a source of constant anxiety and loss. How many do you reckon them? Judging by their tents there must be three or four thousand." ...|$|R

5|$|Brodeur was a {{resident}} of North Caldwell, New Jersey, and currently resides in West Orange, New Jersey, near the Devils' former practice facility, South Mountain Arena. He became a naturalized United States citizen on December 1, 2009, but per IIHF rules <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> able to compete for Canada.|$|E
5|$|Cowell {{stated in}} an {{interview}} during the broadcast week of the first series that he hoped a second series would go ahead, {{and that he had}} received three separate approaches from the United States to create an American version. Peter Fincham, ITV's chief programmer, said in October 2011 that Red or Black? <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> recommissioned for a second series if some changes were made to the format.|$|E

5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> liable for an insignificant crime.|$|E
5|$|The Rjukan Line {{was built}} {{with a maximum}} {{gradient}} of 1.5%. In addition to the line to the plant, a branch line went to the hydroelectric power station at Vemork; completed in 1908 it <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used for service technicians to the power station and had a gradient of 5.7%. Construction in Vestfjorddalen was led by Sigurd Kloumann.|$|E

5|$|This article {{showed that}} the {{statistics}} of absorption and emission of light <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, {{because it was the}} first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers were available to protect the barrage, the drifters would have to be withdrawn at night. The drifters <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> operating for less than twelve hours a day, and would have to leave their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 August, both Montanan and West Bridge were still afloat, albeit with decks awash. Despite {{attempts}} to get Montanan under tow, she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain that the situation was hopeless and he <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|During the {{challenge}} cup period, {{none of the}} leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. A playoff <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> played if teams tied for first-place in their leagues {{at the end of}} the regular season. Challenge games were played until 1912 at any time during hockey season by challenges approved and/or ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees. In 1912, Cup trustees declared that it was only to be defended {{at the end of the}} champion team's regular season.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Following several tyre {{failures}} {{before the}} race, most spectacularly on Ralf Schumacher's Toyota during Friday practice and by Ricardo Zonta {{in the other}} Toyota, Michelin advised its seven customer teams that without a reduction in speed in Turn 13, the tyres provided for the race <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> safe for 10 laps. Michelin had been providing working tyres for the race since 2001. The situation was worsened by the 2005 Formula One rules, which forbade tyre changes during the race.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} {{the site was}} open on the first Saturday in April and October. Admission is free. There is a display on the Schmidt family in the house during each open house. In 2014, the White Sands Missile Range {{announced}} that due to budgetary constraints, the site <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> open once a year, on the first Saturday in April. In 2015, this decision was reversed, and two events were scheduled, in April and October.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} Eastern Bloc countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an Eastern Bloc city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> completed in the 1970s. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
