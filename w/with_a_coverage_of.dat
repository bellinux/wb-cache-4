40|$|Forest floor lichens are {{sensitive}} to variations in habitat conditions. To understand the distribu-tional patterns of forest floor lichen communities and how habitat factors relate to dominant lichen species composition and diversity, we sampled 240 plots (50 cm× 50 cm) in the mountainous area of southern Urumqi, Xinjiang, China. We detected 17 species in total, belonging to 10 genera and 5 families. Cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) showed that plots clustered into four groups: (1) a Cladonia pyxidata + Cladonia cariosa + Cladonia chlorophaea community, including seven species <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> 19. 7 %; (2) a Solorina bispora + Cladonia cariosa + Cladonia scabriuscula community, in-cluding 11 species <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> 21. 1 %; (3) a Cetraria nivalis + Cladonia pyxidata community, in-cluding three species <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> 8. 1 %; and (4) a Peltigera rufescens + P. polydactyla commu-nity, including seven species with the total <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> 23. 83 %.

5000|$|In the 1950s Curti {{undertook}} a collaborative {{social history of}} rural Trempealeau County, Wisconsin using avant-garde quantitative analysis of census records. The book which {{came out of the}} project, The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County (1959) immediately became a pioneer work in what would soon be dubbed the [...] "new social history." [...] Curti's wife Margaret Wooster Curti, provided some of the quantitative methodology. Historians, however, did not emulate it, preferring instead to follow Stephan Thernstrom's model in Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth-Century American City (1964), which used a similar methodology of tracking workers through their careers using censuses and city directories. The difference was urban and rural—urban history was exploding and rural history was a backwater; in addition the Thernstrom model was easier to replicate by a graduate student writing a PhD thesis alone (Curti had numerous research assistants and coauthors). Whereas the [...] "old" [...] social history comprised descriptions of everyday lifestyles, perhaps <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> grass roots political movements (like the Populists), Curti's [...] "new" [...] social history was a systematic examination of the entire population using statistics and social science methodologies.|$|E
