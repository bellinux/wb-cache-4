5|$|The {{mention of}} those princes who were {{publicly}} {{supposed to be}} Christians, as <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in an epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. l. vii c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his family; and forms a contemporary evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian bishop, who lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome, expresses himself with becoming diffidence concerning {{the truth of the}} fact.|$|E
5|$|We {{consider}} {{the triumph of}} the constructive method to be essential for our present. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> not only in the new economy and {{in the development of the}} industry, but also in the psychology of our contemporaries of art. Veshch will champion constructive art, whose mission is not, after all, to embellish life, but to organize it.|$|E
25|$|From {{this time}} Heraclea reappears in history, and assumes the {{position}} of an important city; though we have no explanation of the circumstances that had raised it from its previous insignificance. Thus <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> soon after, joining in the movement originated by Xenodicus of Agrigentum, 309BC, and declaring itself free both from the Carthaginians and Agathocles; though it was soon recovered by Agathocles, on his return from Africa in 305BC.|$|E

25|$|Hungary {{definitely}} condemns {{the missile}} experiments {{carried out by}} the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea on the July 4. In our view, this step gravely endangers the stability and the security of the region. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> an especially unfortunate development that the experiment was carried out in spite of the repeated warning of the international community. North Korea’s step jeopardises the renewal of the six-nation talks set up to solve the North Korean nuclear question.|$|E
25|$|It is next {{mentioned}} in 344 BC, {{when it was}} one of the first cities that declared in favor of Timoleon after his landing in Sicily. At a later period <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> mentioned as espousing the cause of Hieron, and supporting him during his war against the Mamertines, 269 BC. On that occasion he rested his position upon Tyndaris on the left, and on Tauromenium (modern Taormina) on the right. Indeed, the strong position of Tyndaris made it an important strategic post on the Tyrrhenian sea, as Tauromenium was on the Sicilian sea, and hence <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> frequently {{mentioned in}} accounts of subsequent wars. In the First Punic War it was at first dependent upon Carthage; and though the citizens, alarmed at the progress of the Roman armies, were at one time on the point of turning to Rome, they were restrained by the Carthaginians, who carried off all the chief citizens as hostages. In 257 BC, the Battle of Tyndaris took place off the coast of Tyndaris, between the city and the Liparaean islands, in which a Roman fleet under Gaius Atilius Regulus obtained some advantage over the Carthaginian fleet, but without any decisive result. The Roman fleet is described on that occasion as touching at the promontory of Tyndaris, but the city had not yet fallen into their hands, and it was not until after the fall of Panormus (modern Palermo) in 254 BC that Tyndaris expelled the Carthaginian garrison and joined the Roman alliance.|$|E
25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E

[...] "Caprona has been luring us upon her deadly rocks. Well, we'll accept her challenge. We'll land upon Caprona. Along that long front there must be a vulnerable spot. <b>We</b> will <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> Bradley, for <b>we</b> must <b>find</b> <b>it.</b> <b>We</b> must <b>find</b> water on Caprona, or we must die." ...|$|R

25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} all notice of Heraclea during the {{subsequent}} century, and {{the wars of}} Dionysius I of Syracuse with the Carthaginians, suggests that either it did not then exist, or {{must have been in}} a very reduced condition. However the territory of Heraclea Minoa fell under Carthaginian control {{as a result of the}} treaty of 405BC. The next mention of it (under the name of Minoa), when Dion landed there in 357BC, represents it as a small town in the Agrigentine territory, but still subject to Carthage. Hence it is probable that the treaty between Dionysius and the Carthaginians which had fixed the Halycus as the boundary of the latter, had left Heraclea, though on its southeast bank, still in their hands: and, in accordance with this, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> stipulated by the similar treaty concluded with them by Agathocles (314BC), that Heraclea, Selinus, and Himera should continue subject to Carthage, as they had been before.|$|E
25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|E

500|$|The {{protective}} sign of {{the hammer}} was worn by women, as {{we know from the}} fact that it has been found in women's graves. It seems to have been used by the warrior also, in the form of the swastika. [...] Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the riots}} in England in August 2011, Miliband {{called for a}} public inquiry into the events, and insisted society had [...] "to avoid simplistic answers". The call for an inquiry was {{rejected}} by David Cameron, prompting Miliband to say he would set up his own. In a BBC Radio 4 interview shortly after the riots, Miliband spoke of an irresponsibility that applied {{not only to the}} people involved in the riots, but [...] "wherever <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in our society. We've seen in the past few years...MPs' expenses, what happened in the banks". Miliband also said Labour did not do enough to tackle moral problems during its 13 years in office. In December 2011 Miliband appointed Tim Livesey, a former adviser to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to be his full-time chief of staff.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most {{of the time we}} have more chords in a song, because <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> hard writing a great song on just one chord. But if you do it right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, Edmund Gosse {{analyzed}} {{the reception of}} Gray's poem: [...] "It is curious to reflect upon the modest and careless mode in which that poem was first circulated which was destined to enjoy and to retain a higher reputation in literature than any other English poem perhaps than any other poem of the world written between Milton and Wordsworth." [...] He continued by stressing the poem's wide acceptance: [...] "The fame of the Elegy has spread to all countries and has exercised an influence on all the poetry of Europe, from Denmark to Italy, from France to Russia. With the exception of certain works of Byron and Shakespeare, no English poem has been so widely admired and imitated abroad and {{after more than a}} century of existence <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> as fresh as ever, when its copies, even the most popular of all those of Lamartine, are faded and tarnished." [...] He concluded with a reinforcing claim on the poem's place in English poetry: [...] "It possesses the charm of incomparable felicity, of a melody that is not too subtle to charm every ear, of a moral persuasiveness that appeals to every generation, and of metrical skill that in each line proclaims the master. The Elegy may almost be looked upon as the typical piece of English verse, our poem of poems; not that it is the most brilliant or original or profound lyric in our language, but because it combines in more balanced perfection than any other all the qualities that go to the production of a fine poetical effect." ...|$|E
