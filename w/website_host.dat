50|$|A user revolt is {{a social}} {{conflict}} in which users of a website collectively and openly protest a website host's or administrator's instructions for using the website. Sometimes it happens that the website hosts can control a website's use in certain ways, but the hosts also depend on the users to comply with voluntary social rules {{in order for the}} website to operate as the hosts would like. A user revolt occurs when the website users protest against the voluntary social rules of a website, and use the website {{in a way that is}} in conflict with the wishes of the <b>website</b> <b>host</b> or administrators.|$|E
50|$|Internet-based {{activism}} {{is sometimes}} called a user revolt when website users protest {{the terms of a}} website while using that website for other purposes. A distinction between a user revolt and Internet-based activism could be that in a user revolt, an objective of the protest is to revolt against the website itself. In Internet-based activism, the primary goal of the protest is something other than reforming a website, although websites which create barriers to the larger protest may incidentally experience a user revolt for participating in the larger conflict. An example of a situation in which Internet activism includes a user revolt might be when users wish to engage in prohibited political discussion, but a government compels the <b>website</b> <b>host</b> to censor those discussions. The core conflict in this case is between users and the government, and not that the website itself as a communication medium. However, when the website as a communication medium chooses to create barriers to communication for users, then users of the website organize a user revolt even when the primary objective is something other than a website protest.|$|E
50|$|The album's {{release on}} November 11, 2000 also saw their <b>website</b> <b>host</b> {{a series of}} {{competitions}} and giveaways. From November 1, the UK division of Interscope Records held a contest, with fans invited to log onto the website daily {{to pick up a}} series of coded clues which led to a hidden message. Fans who solved the riddle received an exclusive download, and were entered into a draw for a one-week trip for two to meet the band in Hollywood. On November 14, the band took a break from the Guns, God and Government Tour to perform a brief, four-song set at an intimate, invitation-only acoustic performance at the Saci nightclub in New York City, with tickets for the show given out for free via their website. Around the time of the release of the album's third single ("The Nobodies") in the UK, the website hosted yet another competition. The song's release had been timed to coincide with the band's appearance at the Reading Festival, and the winner of the competition was awarded two full-weekend passes to the festival, as well as unrestricted backstage access and a private sleeping area.|$|E

But in August 2016, those longstanding claims in his biography were disproved after CNN fact-checked them. North Greenville University told CNN that Burns attended the school for just one semester and did not receive a degree. Additionally, when questioned by CNN about his claimed participation in the Army Reserve, Burns, who had served in the South Carolina Army National Guard, from 2001 to 2005, stated [...] "the Army South Carolina National Guard is Reserves." [...] However, CNN noted that the South Carolina National Guard is a completely separate organization, unrelated to the Army Reserve.

50|$|Marco is {{the only}} son of Franco Silvani (Gary Down). During {{his job as a}} local fruit and veg supplier, Marco sees a lot of Carmella Cammeniti. Marco and Carmella get talking and he finds out that she is {{pregnant}} and planning to take her fruit business online. Marco later helps Carmella out with some boxes and proposes that they become business partners. Carmella tells Marco that they just have a business partnership and Marco respects whatever she wants. Carmella suffers from stomach pains and is rushed to hospital. Marco finds himself stuck in the middle when Oliver Barnes arrives and Oliver asks Marco to leave. Marco returns with some flowers and says they are pink for a girl, which angers Oliver as he did not know the gender of the baby. Carmella accepts an offer from Marco to use his family's cottage for a few days. She and her sister have a look around and find photos of his wedding. Marco arrives with some supplies and Carmella confronts him. He tells her that he was married, but is now divorced. He then kisses Carmella. Marco goes behind Carmella's back to speak to the customers and when their <b>website</b> <b>host</b> goes bust, Marco is critical of her efforts to create another site. He then flirts with a new client, knowing that Carmella was watching. Marco arranges a cocktail party at his apartment and asks Carmella to co-host and invite all of their customers. The evening goes well and Marco and Carmella spend their first night together. Marco's mother, Patrizia (Lise Rodgers) and sister, Mia (Petra Yared) arrive at the apartment in the morning and are surprised to see Carmella. Marco tells his mother that he wants to be with Carmella. He also tells Mia that he is not getting back with his former wife.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>website</b> <b>host</b> server with web {{quality of service}} (QoS) capabilities to offer differentiated services. A quantitative modelling framework is set up to analyse the economic benefits of differentiated services and to build optimization models for managing the <b>website</b> <b>host</b> 2 ̆ 7 s connection bandwidth to the Internet (which {{is assumed to be}} the bottleneck factor determining the QoS). Three models are formulated corresponding to three operational scenarios to provide differentiated services. The first is for the marketing manager to classify visit requests as premium or basic when the information technology (IT) manager has already reserved bandwidths for the two classes, and the second is for the IT manager to allocate the total available bandwidth to each class when the marketing manager has already designated which visit requests are premium and which are basic. The third is for the joint optimization of request classification and bandwidth allocation when centralized coordination is possible. Analytic results are obtained for a special case that corresponds to very impatient customers requesting large amounts of data. Qualitative insights gained and numerical results obtained strongly support the implementation of differentiated services. More interestingly, the decentralized models that use simple and rough-cut rules yield solutions almost as good as the joint optimization model...|$|E
40|$|Social {{software}} {{has become}} pervasive including {{technologies such as}} blogs, wikis, and social networking sites. Interactive Web 2. 0 technology is distinguished from earlier Internet channels, with content provided {{not only from the}} <b>website</b> <b>host,</b> but also and most importantly, user-generated content. These social technologies are increasingly entering the enterprise, involving complex social and psychological aspects as well as an understanding of traditional technology acceptance factors. Organizations trying to reap potential benefits of enterprise social software (ESS) must successfully implement and maintain ESS tools. This research develops a framework for assessing knowledge sharing based on reciprocal determinism theory and augmented with technology acceptance, sociological, and psychological factors. Semi-structured interviews with IT professionals, followed by a written survey of employees using ESS are used to collect data. The hermeneutic circle methodology is used to analyze the interview transcripts and structural equation modeling is used to analyze the survey data. Results show technological advantage has no significant effect on the intention to share knowledge, but community cohesiveness and individual willingness significantly affect knowledge sharing intention and behavior. The study offers a synthesized model of variables affecting knowledge sharing as well as a better understanding of best practices for organizations to consider when implementing and maintaining ESS tools for employee knowledge sharing and collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Aims and Objectives The primary {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to investigate the nature of the relationships between self-compassion, self-esteem and schizotypy using a non-clinical sample. A secondary aim was to investigate the mechanisms which help to explain any relationships found. In utilising a non-clinical sample the study aimed to determine whether relationships exist between the variables prior to the onset of psychosis within a continuum approach to schizotypy. A final objective was to identify specific correlates of self-compassion and schizotypy through detailed subscale analyses. Method The study utilised a quantitative, cross-sectional design. Participants completed self-report questionnaires via a secure <b>website</b> <b>host</b> measuring: self-compassion, global self-esteem, and trait schizotypy. A total of 93 participants took part in {{the research}}. Results As predicted, highly significant negative correlations were determined between self-compassion and schizotypy, and between self-esteem and schizotypy. With respect to the mechanisms through which these variables were related, self-compassion was not found to moderate the relationship between self-esteem and schizotypy. However, self-compassion and schizotypy were found to be related via both a direct and an indirect route, which was mediated by self-esteem. Conclusions The study is the first to investigate the nature of the relationships amongst self-compassion, self-esteem and schizotypy in a non-clinical population, utilising the schizotypy construct as an analogue of the psychosis continuum. The findings indicated that there may be both a direct, and an indirect route through self-esteem, RELATIONSHIPS AMONGST SELF-COMPASSION, SELF-ESTEEM AND SCHIZOTYPY iv which accounted for the relationship between self-compassion and schizotypy. The results mirror associations determined within clinical populations. The authors argues that in utilising schizotypy as an analogue of the psychosis continuum {{the results of this study}} provide evidence that self-esteem and self-compassion may reflect underlying mechanisms which could underpin schizotypal symptomatology...|$|E
