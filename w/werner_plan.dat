40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare and {{contrast}} the <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan</b> and the Delors Report and to explain why the latter succeeded in facilitating the realisation of the European Monetary Union. Thus, the environment that contributed to the successful implementation of the latter and the major politico-economic developments in the European Economic Community are assessed. This will shed further light upon the nature of the road that led to the establishment of the EMU and inform judgements concerning its viability. The major conclusion is that the Delors Report was successful due to the institutional approach it envisaged and the political momentum this approach gathered. Consequently, it can provide an example for the resolution of current international monetary problems. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} a European Monetary Union can be {{interpreted}} in different ways. To most non-economists it probably implies a single European currency and a European central bank. To economists, however, a monetary union implies only (in {{the words of the}} 1970 <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan)</b> : 'the irrevocable fixing of parities and the total liberalization of capital movements'. To others still a monetary union might be reached if there is a widely used European parallel currency. This article argues that these paradigms imply different degrees of monetary integration, and that the benefits that can be expected from a monetary union for Europe depend on the degree of monetary integration. Which paradigm should be chosen, therefore, depends on the reasons for which a monetary union for Europe is deemed desirable. Copyright 1989 BPL. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{research}} projects currently under way {{is dedicated to the}} European vocation and achievements of Pierre Werner, a former Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, unanimously recognised as one of the architects of Economic and Monetary Union. The first stage of the research project particularly focuses on the plan for the establishment by stages of an economic and monetary union (more widely known as the Werner Report or the <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan),</b> drawn up by a group of experts chaired by Pierre Werner and officially presented on 8 October 1970 in Luxembourg. The project will then concentrate on the events that subsequently led to Economic and Monetary Union, as seen through the eyes of Pierre Werner and from the perspective of his own contribution; it will also examine a number of issues in which the former Luxembourg Prime Minister was particularly involved, such as the question of the seats of the institutions, the Luxembourg Compromise, the accession of the United Kingdom, and cooperation between the Benelux countries and the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU).

40|$|European Monetary Integration - From the Payments Union to the Monetary Union Abstract This thesis attemps to {{systematically}} comprehend the European monetary integration after 1945. Hereby it proceeds from two basic considerations (part I). 1. Monetary integration {{is part of}} political integration so that primarily the specific European approach to integration must be reflected upon. 2. Monetary integration in itself follows a logic connection of different stages of monetary integration. During the reflection upon political integration (chapter 1) the premisses of integration are well to the fore. These are political odds given which determine monetary integration. It is distinguished between general premisses (e. g. solidarity between states, equality of states, willingness to renounce of sovereignty) as determining every process of integration and specifically European premisses (e. g. the national state method of integration, the real economic method of integration, the hierarchy of integration) which crystallize {{in connection with the}} Treaty of Rome. Monetary integration, according to a further assumption of this thesis, takes place in specific monetary stages or monetary orders (chapter 2). In this step of analysis the thesis distinguishes between closed currency areas, the payments union, the order of exchange rates, the monetary system, the monetary union and the unified monetary order. In each case the different stages excel by a distinct functional mechanism and differing degrees of renunciation of sovereignty. The elaborated premisses of integration enter into the monetary stages in that the general premisses structure the respectiv monetary order while the specifically European premisses determine the course of monetary integration. Within this frame of analysis European history of monetary unification is then explored, as far as it has manifested in treaties and plannings (part II). In detail these are the European Payments Union (EPU), the European Monetary Agreement (EMA), the Treaty of the European Economic Community (EECT), the so called Snake, the European Monetary System (EMS), the cross-border capital movements, plannings on a monetary system, the <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan</b> and the Maastricht Plan. The EPU is shown as a monetary order which was successful because of the consideration of the premisses of integration, the potential of which with regard to a further monetary integration was not made use of, however (chapter 3). Europeans? difficulties with the different orders of exchange rates are attributed to unsatisfactory consideration of the premisses of integration and a lacking coordination in the politics of capital movements (chapter 4). The fact that the proposals concerning the establishing of a monetary system were not taken up is explained by the thesis with a missing willingness of co-operation of the Federal Republic of Germany (chapter 5). Finally an explanation is offered {{for the fact that the}} Maastricht Plan was successfully transfered into action while the <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan</b> failed (chapter 6). The thesis concludes with reflections upon its coherent findings with regard to monetary integration and draws theoretical conclusions in a discussion of the neofunctionalist theory (part III, chapter 7). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the single currency {{is one of the}} most important events that will strongly affect our lives. The process has been drawn out, starting in 1990 with the Delors Plan. The euro is the logical outcome of the single market. It will have taken twelve years to implement, just like the single tariff. L'euro has a political and economic logic. Many currencies make a single financial market difficult to have, but a single market does not require a single currency and it will not benefit everyone. We must be ready to make sacrifices. A difficulty with monetary union is the abscence of a common budgetary policy. Germany is mistrustful and wants to impose automatic penalties to prevent a weakening of the euro. German business is in favour of the euro to avoid competitive devaluations from the South, while German sayers are afraid to lose out. Public finances have deteriorated badly and Maastricht criteria are formally complied with creative accounting in Germain, and France as much as Spain. This is collective deception. The transition period has been too long and badly constructed, extending the <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan</b> of the sixties in the instantaneous markets and large indebtedness of the nineties. The burocratic construction of the Euro in three phases is not coherent. We have learnt nothing of the problems of the, European Exchange Mechanism in returning to fixed exchange rates. There will be difficult times for Spain...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} history and the {{institutional}} background of European integration {{to the establishment of}} the economic and monetary union in the European Union (EU). After the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the late 1950 s, attempts at monetary integration, and ultimately monetary union, tended to assume importance only as a result of financial crisis and then returned to being a vague objective as soon as the crisis recedes. In recent years, however, monetary integration has assumed greater urgency. Economic union, on the other hand, has followed a smoother transition. Economic integration was used after the Second World War to realize political goals, chiefly to anchor West Germany within the western European alliance. Since that time the economies of member states have slowly integrated. The economic environment of the 1950 s {{is a far cry from}} the integrated community of today. In the 1950 s European currencies were not convertible and domestic trade was highly protected. Intra-European trade was based on bilateral clearing arrangements institutionalized by the European Payments Union. Today EU currencies are fully convertible; capital controls, intra-EU tariffs, and quotas have been eliminated; and the single market has been completed. Monetary union has gone through a number of stages. The <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan</b> of the early 1970 s, which set the goal of economic and monetary union by the end of the decade, was only partially implemented. Its failure can be put down to unfavorable international economic conditions and poor institutional structures. In the early 1980 s a new monetary initiative, the European Monetary System (EMS), was launched. It struggled through its initial phase until it was replaced by the current euro arrangements. These successive stages ultimately culminated in the Maastricht Treaty, which laid out a precise path and timetable for economic and monetary union. ...|$|E
40|$|This volume {{deals with}} US {{policy and the}} end of the Bretton Woods fixed {{exchange}} rates regime between 1969 and 1973. It is based on the records of the three secretaries that served in the US Treasury under the Nixon administration (Kennedy, Connally and Shultz) on the files of their undersecretary for Monetary Affairs (Volcker), and on White House, NSC, Federal Reserve and State Department records. From the very beginning of its term in office, the Nixon administration included the need for a different international monetary system in the broad process of reshaping of US foreign policy that would take the forms of the Nixon Doctrine, Détente, and the opening to China. US economic and political exigencies called for a "flexible" system based on the dollar, intended to serve the trends toward growing transnational investments by US companies and banks, as well as the perceived need of a diminished financial constraint on overseas military commitments. However implicitly, and with a trial and error process concerning implementation, this entailed a de facto new conception of US hegemony globally, as well as a serious clash of interests with the West European allies in particular. As West European plans, to create their own shield against monetary instability, took on growing credibility throughout 1970 with the launching of the EMU and the <b>Werner</b> <b>plan,</b> US policymakers moved towards the unilateral suspension of their commitment to Bretton Woods. This came on 15 August 1971, after months of deep internal debate within the administration, involving both economic and geopolitical reflections. The second half of 1971, as well as the year 1972, marked the beginning of a different phase. The US administration proceeded quite ruthlessly in the dismantling of the Bretton Woods system, sometimes actually using global financial instability to secure its objectives. A new conception of global American power was taking shape, and, for what concerns the Transatlantic relationship, a clearer definition of western hierarchies de facto replaced the idealistic visions of the "partnership" of the 1960 s...|$|E
40|$|It {{is nearly}} {{impossible}} to fully understand the developments and problems of European economic and monetary integration without examining its historical and political background. European monetary integration has at times been propelled, at times been hindered by political motives and developments. Political motivations were already of great importance for the first stage of European economic and monetary integration in the framework of the OEEC and the European Payments Union in the forties and fifties. Even more for the creation of the European Communities (ECSC, EURATOM, EEC) in the fifties. However, considerations of national sovereignty and diverse if not conflicting concepts of economic and monetary policy priorities resulted in the virtual exclusion of economic and monetary policies from any serious attempts of coordination and harmonization. The completion of the EEC customs union and the monetary crises in the late sixties led to a major effort in economic and monetary policy integration culminating in the <b>Werner</b> <b>Plan</b> of 1970. The only result of these efforts was the "snake" which, while in the end shrinking to {{not much more than a}} DM zone, provided some framework for monetary cooperation. and The economic difficulties of the seventies on a European and global scale but also the desire to boost the political momentum behind European integration led to the EMS. Political considerations played an important role not only in reviving the process toward Economic and Monetary Union which led to the Delors Report but also in the specific design of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and in the premature notion of the EMS as a de facto monetary union. Contrary to many expectations, the EMS crises in 1992 and 1993 did not lead to an abandonment of the objectives of the Maastricht Treaty but resulted in efforts - for political as well as economic reasons - to salvage the EMS and to continue with efforts aimed at economic convergence for the core of the EMS countries. Strong adherence to national sovereignty, insufficient economic convergence, and difficulties in agreeing on meaningful elements of political union undermined until now attempts to create EMU. The substitution of national currencies - powerful symbols of national sovereignty and achievements - by an untested European currency requires progress in the mentioned areas...|$|E
