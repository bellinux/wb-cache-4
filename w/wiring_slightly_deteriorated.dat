They also showed that nomadic populations had higher frequencies of 7R alleles than sedentary ones.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. A questionnaire survey of organic sector body inspectors, organic advisors and farm animal veterinarians was conducted to examine the respondents’ perceptions of the ability of the organic standards to deliver positive impacts on welfare of organic livestock. A total of 44 separate standards concerning livestock production were extracted from the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Production livestock production standards. The respondents were asked to consider the potential impact of each standard on animal welfare in comparison to the routine practices used on conventional farms, using a five-point scale (improve significantly, improve <b>slightly,</b> no impact, <b>deteriorate</b> <b>slightly</b> and <b>deteriorate</b> significantly). A simple scoring system was used to rank the different standards in terms of their perceived positive impact on animal welfare. The significance of differences between respondent groups and livestock species were examined. Preliminary findings of the survey are summarised and the usefulness of the approach to evaluate livestock production standards is discussed...|$|R
30|$|As shown, the {{nanoparticles}} are aggregated in {{ion exchangers}} during their treatment with glycerol. In {{order to reach}} stability of incorporated nanoparticles and functional properties of the materials, the modification procedure was performed in glycerol media. Under these conditions, both non-aggregated nanoparticles and their small aggregates (up to 300  nm) are formed. They are evidently located inside voids between gel regions and perform a function of a barrier against adsorption of organic impurities on hydrophobic fragments of hydrocarbonaceous chains. No sufficient influence of ZHP on semi-permittivity of the cation-exchange membrane was found in aqueous NaCl solutions. At the same time, HZD <b>slightly</b> <b>deteriorates</b> charge selectivity of the anion-exchange membranes in neutral media due to amphoteric properties of the modifier.

In this article we present, for the first time, beam test results from recently manufactured CVD diamond strip detectors and their behavior under low doses of electrons from a β-source and the performance before and after intense (> 10 ^ 15 / cm^ 2) proton- and pion-irradiations.

In the present work, we study the dynamical properties of a neural network designed to store sparsely coded sequential patterns rather than static ones.

The results indicate that the nature of the basin of attraction depends on the methods of activity control employed.

40|$|An {{electronically}} controllable, switched parasitic {{planar array}} {{can be used}} for the purpose of direction finding. The method proposed in this paper exploits the electronic beam steering, achieved by simply inserting an appropriate digital word in the antenna feeding circuit, to resolve two signals. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the strengths and the angular positions of the incoming signals in the azimuth plane. The results obtained concentrate on wideband signaling in a multipath environment, with and without the presence of noise. The antenna design and the reliability of the direction-finding method are presented. The proposed method is strongly dependent on the type of the receiving antenna (a switched parasitic planar array is superior to a ""uniform"" antenna with identical radiation patterns). Increasing the number of radiation patterns available improves the reliability of the method. The reliability of the method <b>slightly</b> <b>deteriorates,</b> as the angular discrimination of the incoming signals becomes smaller, but the results remain quite satisfying...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{relationship}} between anticholinergic activity (AA) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we rereview our hypothesis of the endogenous appearance of AA in AD. Briefly, because acetylcholine (ACh) regulates not only cognitive function but also the inflammatory system, when ACh downregulation reaches a critical level, inflammation increases, triggering the appearance of cytokines with AA. Moreover, based on a case report of a patient with mild AD and <b>slightly</b> <b>deteriorated</b> ACh, we also speculate that AA can appear endogenously in Lewy body disease due to the dual action of the downregulation of ACh and hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Based on these hypotheses, we consider AA to be a behavioral pathology of Lewy body disease. We also propose the concept of “anticholinergic spectrum disorders,” which encompass a variety of conditions, including AD, Lewy body disease, and delirium. Finally, we suggest the prescription of cholinesterase inhibitors to patients in this spectrum of disorders to abolish AA by upregulating ACh...|$|R

In this work, activated carbon saturated with toluene was efficiently regenerated by microwave irradiation.
