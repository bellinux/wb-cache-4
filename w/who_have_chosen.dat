40|$|In this research, {{we explore}} how {{experience}} with an "attraction set" of options, designed to elicit an asymmetric-dominance (attraction) effect, affects choice making {{in a second}} "compromise set" designed to elicit a compromise effect. In Experiment 1, when a compromise set was presented, subjects <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> an asymmetrically dominating option from an attraction set {{were less likely to}} surrender to the compromise heuristic than their counterparts <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> the equivalent option from a binary set. Lower susceptibility to the compromise heuristic suggests that asymmetric dominance might have facilitated the learning of attribute preferences. In Experiment 2, subjects were asked to make six choices in the personal computer category. Subjects <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> any number of asymmetrically dominating options from the attraction condition were less susceptible to the compromise heuristic in a subsequent choice task than their counterparts <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> the same number of equivalent options from the binary condition. It was unlikely that the effect was caused by better memory of asymmetrically dominating options subjects <b>had</b> previously <b>chosen.</b> Results from the two experiments corroborated the reasoning that asymmetric dominance affects the learning of attribute weights and this effect persists in a subsequent choice task...|$|R

25|$|From 2000 to 2010, the United States Census Bureau {{reported}} that Mississippi {{had the highest}} rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race, up 70 percent in the decade; it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population. In addition, Mississippi led the nation {{for most of the last}} decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population. The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of racial segregation.

25|$|In the United States, anesthesiologists are {{physicians}} (MD or DO) <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> {{to specialize}} in anesthesiology and are extensively trained medical care providers in the United States. Anesthesiologists in the United States must have completed an undergraduate college program (that includes pre-medical requirements) and four years of medical school training. Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States require successful completion of four years of residency training for board certification eligibility in the specialty of anesthesiology. An anesthesiology residency requires a one-year medicine or surgery internship followed by three years of anesthesiology training. Anesthesiology residents face multiple examinations during their residency, including exams encompassing physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and other medical sciences addressed in medical school, along with multiple anesthesia knowledge tests which assess progress during residency. Successful completion of a board exam after completion of residency is required for board certification. The average salary for a full-time anesthesiologists is roughly $258,100, according to US News. The number of jobs are rounding to about 170,400 according to statistics in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Escaping {{into hiding}} with Sae's help, the protagonist convenes with his friends, Sae, and Sojiro; they {{determine}} that the conspiracy's leader is Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, the protagonist later recognizes Shido as the same man he encountered before his probation. The group infiltrates Shido's Palace, and there they face Akechi, revealed to be Shido's illegitimate son bent on revenge towards Shido for his years of neglect. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to allow the Phantom Thieves to reach Shido. Shido is defeated, and {{in the real world}} confesses to all his actions. The game then skips forward to just before Christmas; the general public has turned on the Phantom Thieves, and Sae's efforts to prosecute Shido are failing. The Phantom Thieves make a final heist to steal the Treasure of the Mementos, the people's Palace at the Metaverse's core. Inside they find the imprisoned Shadows of their targets and other Tokyo residents, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> to give up making their own decisions.
