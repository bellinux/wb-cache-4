25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|Director {{and film}} critic Sudhish Kamath called Enthiran [...] "a superhero film, a sci-fi adventure, a {{triangular}} love {{story with a}} hint of the Ramayana", while remarking that Enthiran similarities to The Terminator (1984) were [...] "more than obvious. Not just visually– <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the Superstar with one human eye and one scarred metallic eye but also intentionally spelt out when the bad robot announces that he has created Terminators." [...] Kamath compared two of the film's robots to C-3PO and R2-D2, droids from the Star Wars film series, which was referenced in Enthiran when Vaseegaran refers to one of his creations as [...] "R2".|$|E

500|$|Sanjith Sidhardhan of The Times of India {{rated the}} film 3.5 out of 5: [...] "Maheshinte Prathikaaram {{is a movie}} that has many feel-good moments and {{something}} everybody can relate to. This tale of sweet revenge is a rare genial comedy". He appreciated its casting and screenplay, cinematography, editing and music, praising the performances of Faasil and other cast members and calling the film [...] "visually appealing". Paresh C. Palicha of Rediff.com gave the film three out of five stars, praising Faasil's performance and its narrative style: [...] "The plot is driven by characters and their reactions to a particular situation, {{and there is no}} solid form of story <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> a growth in characters or logical progression in the story".|$|E

The release of the official music video followed on 17 May 2017 on the same platform, but was not made available to watch until 26 May 2017. It was directed by Manuel Escalante of Enjambre Producciones in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona, with production and photography handled by him along with Petter Lettocha and José Casillas. When interviewed, Muñiz expained {{the concept of the}} visual, [...] " [...] We were very moved by {{the idea of having a}} story of a long-distance virtual and sentimental relationship that is carried out through virtual reality: one in Mexico and the other one in Barcelona. Everything begins [...] when I invariably connect with my partner (Alexandra Stan) through a virtual reality system in which we live a super romance and <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> each other in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona." ...|$|E

[...] The mathematics of commerce – Arabic numerals, multiplication, division, fractions, the tools needed to calculate purchases and sales of goods and other commercial transactions – was {{essentially the same as}} the mathematics of navigation.

2500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{shots of the}} library and a book called [...] "The Story of Us". Swift narrates the story while {{standing}} between two bookshelves, sitting on a desk and lying across a table (and occasionally lying on top of [...] "The Story of Us") {{with a stack of}} books next to her, as we see scenes flashing back and forth between her and her ex-boyfriend, students in the library, some library staff, and her band playing the song. The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she is finding a place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across the room from her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other. The video ends with a break out of the other classmates and staff joining in, the classmates throwing away their papers and they and the staff begin dancing to the song while both Swift and her ex are face to face with each other in a very awkward moment, both trying to say how the other feels, but eventually they both shrug at each other and walk away. The last shot is of Swift closing the book of [...] "The Story of Us".|$|E
