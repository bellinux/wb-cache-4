It was made of a thick, prepared floor of sand and clay, which supported a group of buildings. Yellow and red clay were used in different areas for <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> aesthetic purposes. It was swept clean of all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{route from}} Scafell Pike to Scafell (or its reverse) {{is one of}} the most {{frustrating}} in the Lake District. <b>What</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a direct route is in fact very hazardous as it has to negotiate Broad Stand crag, which is a dangerous and exposed scramble that has caused many accidents and injuries. It is usually treated as a rock climb, with appropriate ropes and belay protection. Wainwright warns against its dangers to walkers. Its dangers are more obvious travelling from Scafell Pike, but travelling from Scafell, the route loses a lot of height before the danger is seen.|$|E
500|$|Many {{observers}} expressed {{doubts about}} the sincerity and credibility of Gui's confession. The Washington Post described the narrative as [...] "messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> outright fiction". Chinese state media said in late February 2016 that Gui was being held for [...] "illegal business operations". He {{is alleged to have}} knowingly distributed books not approved by China's press and publication authority since October 2014. Gui remains in detention in China a year after his disappearance.|$|E

500|$|The fifth part of [...] "Trinity War" [...] {{was given}} 4 stars out of 5 by Doug Zawiska at Comic Book Resources. He said, [...] "The pacing of Justice League Dark #23 is smart and gives readers lots to chew on, {{but it also}} leaves <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a lot left to be {{resolved}} in the approaching final chapter of [...] "Trinity War"." [...] He also praised Janin's ability to accurately draw the characters used in the issue. Joshua Yehl of IGN also had similar sentiments, saying [...] "While [...] "Trinity War’s" [...] overall story is wonky, this chapter of Justice League Dark at least makes it a fun time." [...] He also enjoyed Janin's art and gave the issue a 7.6 out of 10. Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "Everything about this issue feels like a climax...even if next week’s final chapter proves {{to be less than}} definitive." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Folie à Deux" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Dass of New Straits Times was positive toward the episode, considering it [...] "highly watchable". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a glowing review and awarded it an [...] "A". He praised {{the way it}} [...] "starts out as <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a Mulder-centric episode, then slowly inverts on itself to become a Scully-centric episode". VanDerWerff also positively critiqued {{the manner in which}} [...] "the monster [...] works on a metaphorical level as well". He concluded that the episode's main theme—that [...] "adness is always better when shared by two"—was a [...] "great idea" [...] that resulted in [...] "one of the greatest episodes the show ever did". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "a pleasant enough diversion" [...] from the then-upcoming series feature film. He wrote that, while the episode fits the mold of [...] "the traditional late-season summary of the evolving character dynamic", the entry manages to frame Scully’s psychology [...] "in the limelight" [...] without actually [...] "emphasiz Scully herself".|$|E
500|$|Gui's {{confession}} {{was received}} with incredulity, {{and many of}} the facts surrounding his disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after his disappearance, were called into question. The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Jasper Tsang, said: [...] "the China Central Television (CCTV) report [...] {{did not seem to be}} able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation". Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying: [...] "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility". The Washington Post said: [...] "The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even". Amnesty International’s China researcher cast doubt on the narrative, asking: [...] "Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case?" [...] The Guardian drew a connection to Operation Fox Hunt, a Chinese government campaign launched by Xi Jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of the regime who had fled abroad, and which may also have been responsible for the abduction of the other missing booksellers. By mid-June 2016, Gui's family had not yet received official confirmation that he was under detention, according to Gui's daughter.|$|E

But that may be the point. Televised confessions don't tend to trade in logic, or truth. They trade in fear." [...] Following China Central Television's release of videotaped confessions from Gui Minhai – and of Swedish NGO staffer Peter Dahlin, Reporters Without Borders condemned China's [...] "dissemination of forced 'confessions' that have no informational value". The organisation urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for [...] "knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress". Hong Kong's chief executive said that he was unable to act as [...] "the Gui Minhai case has not been reported to the Hong Kong police or the government".|$|E
500|$|Responses to Leonard's {{performance}} {{were mostly}} positive. In a recap {{of the pilot}} episode, Tom Shales of The Washington Post quoted [...] "Leonard has been playing upstanding young men for <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> forever, but he's {{still one of the}} most outstanding upstanding young men in the acting racket". However, Sherwin Nurland of Slate stated that Leonard often seems so detached that [...] "he'd be better off in another show". In a recap of the season four episode [...] "Ugly" [...] Nina Smith of TV Guide said that she thinks that the most convincing writing of the show has always been the scenes in which Cuddy and Wilson [...] "spar" [...] with House. In a 2008 press conference, Katie Jacobs, who works as an executive producer for the show, praised Leonard for being equally adept at comedy and drama. TV Gal, of Zap2it, stated that she [...] "truly appreciates" [...] what Leonard brings to the show, being the only character who [...] "truly stands up to House" [...] and [...] "quietly and subtly" [...] giving the show [...] "some of its best moments". In an article about whom to keep if the writers of House decided to minor down the cast, Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune said that Wilson can [...] "never, never, never, never" [...] leave the show. Ryan also listed Wilson on her list of [...] "5 Great Characters", saying that Leonard is the [...] "underrated linchpin of the excellent “House” cast".|$|E

2500|$|Con men and grifters too may use {{techniques}} of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games {{is an obvious}} example, and not a surprising one: {{one of the most}} respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, The Expert at the Card Table by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as [...] "Find the Lady" [...] or [...] "Three-card Monte" [...] is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.|$|E

2500|$|... {{uses the}} device of the {{palimpsest}} {{to present a}} fictional tissue combining elements of both ancient and modern sources {{as well as the}} [...] "dialogue" [...] of its two protagonists. It is composed of a series of fragmented entries in a fictional diary recording the experiences of an unnamed protagonist during a train journey into an unknown land. The man has been released - or escaped - from some time of confinement elliptically described in his journal and reminiscent of a hospital, prison, ghetto or enclave of some sort. His subsequent wanderings among desolate landscapes on the verge of reality are set in a closely detailed, and somehow Kafkaesque, atmosphere, undercutting the point that the most dreamlike occurrences are also the realest. Along the way, the protagonist delves deeper in <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a quasi-religious quest while, at the same time, his growing impression of being stalked introduces an element of suspense and a film noir-like quality. Thus, the text hinges on the metaphysical but is also reminiscent of an L.A. private eye in a 1940s detective novel closing upon an extraordinary discovery. Z213: Exit ends with a description of a sacrifice where the protagonist and a [...] "hungry band feasting" [...] roast a lamb on a spit, cutting and skinning its still bleating body and removing its entrails as if observing a sacred rite.|$|E
2500|$|THEM Anime Reviews' Stig Høgset found Rias' {{personality}} to be [...] "an even mix {{of a lot}} of things", pointing out the relationship between her and Issei to be similar to those of a big sister and little brother, yet, despite this being [...] "endearing", her character is [...] "kind of a badass as well". However, Rias' role as a damsel in distress trope in the last few episodes of the anime was criticized, as well as the [...] "inevitability that Rias ends up falling in love with [...]" [...] Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network, in his preview guide of winter 2012 anime, found High School DxD to be [...] "a fanservice show, one that yet again plays with the master/slave relationship", except unlike most others, the female (Rias) is in the [...] "master" [...] role. Despite this, since Rias is [...] "naked for <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> most of her screen time [...] and is introduced to us by stripping {{in front of the camera}} and showering", Bertschy writes that perhaps [...] "this is the fanservice show that caters to dudes who want to be dominated." [...] Carl Kimlinger, however, found Issei to be a [...] "loathsome little creature" [...] and Rias to be uninteresting, while complaining about what he perceived to be the series' poor storyline.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Debruge of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "From a creative standpoint, {{this is the}} studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Dragon." [...] Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "It's refreshing to see a nonwhite lead, and the husky-voiced pop singer is likable as a brave-hearted kid searching for her mother. But man, is {{there a lot of}} Rihanna in this movie: She also provides <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the entirety of the film's soundtrack, making it feel like a vanity project (is 'vanimation' a thing?)." [...] Barbara VanDenburgh of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "For all its energy, razzle-dazzle and whiz-bang technology, it doesn't know how to tell a simple story or cobble together three-dimensional characters, and that's a problem not even the best of 3-D glasses can fix." [...] Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "I kept thinking about Lilo & Stitch while watching Home, a decidedly disappointing effort based on the popular kid-lit book The True Meaning of Smekday from the already embattled folks at DreamWorks Animation." ...|$|E
