50|$|Barns not {{involved}} in animal husbandry were most commonly the crib barn (corn cribs or other types of granaries), storage barns, or processing barns. Crib barns were typically built of unchinked logs, although they were sometimes covered with vertical <b>wood</b> siding. <b>Storage</b> barns often housed unprocessed crops or those awaiting consumption or transport to market. Processing barns were specialized structures that were necessary for helping to actually process the crop.|$|R

Dried manure contains a lot of energy, produces hardly any smoke and is used all around the globe in areas that lack wood.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{pieces of}} wood {{submerged}} in water were used to simulate leaching from sprinkled <b>wood</b> during <b>storage.</b> Pieces of the three most common Swedish species, Norway spruce, Scots pine, and Downy birch (Betula pubescens), were stored in buckets of water for 6  weeks. Wood pieces with bark, wood pieces gently and carefully debarked, and pure bark were compared. The water was analysed during the storage period for total organic carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, colour, pH, and distillable phenols.|$|R
50|$|Once under Prussian rule in 1772, {{the temple}} fell into disrepair. In 1786, Prussian {{authorities}} removed all furniture, destroyed pews and altars, and burned the wooden fence. The devastated building then {{served as a}} granary, before being converted into 1790 to a powder magazine for the stationed Prussian Rifle Battalion. In 1829 the authorities demolished {{the remains of the}} church and the square: the plot was used as a <b>wood</b> <b>storage</b> for a nearby sawmill.|$|E
50|$|The James S. Thompson House is a {{historical}} home located just outside New Boston, in Mercer County, Illinois. The two story brick Italianate house was completed in 1862, built by James S.

A wooden barn and wooden children's playhouse were also built by 1862.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{built in}} 1880, {{additional}} {{work was done}} in 1934. The structure was built by 19th-century Swedish immigrants to the United States. It reflects church architectural traditions of Sweden. The bell tower is off-center as was common in Sweden. Unlike in Sweden, the bell tower has been enclosed and the lower room that was created is used for tools and <b>wood</b> <b>storage.</b> The structure has been adapted from a traditional architectural form that dates from the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{housing the}} mithraeum, the {{subterranean}} tunnels served {{to heat the}} baths and as sewers for the outflow of water.

40|$|The {{result of}} dip {{diffusion}} treatment of ten wood species from lrian Jaya is {{reported in this}} paper. The wood species comprised among others wafut (Cananga odorata Hook. f. et Th.), starka (Octomeles sumatrana Miq.), senai (Dracontomelon mangiferum Bl.), sutiet (Spondias cytherea Sonn.), bemoe (Canarium indicum L.), raja (Pterygota forbesii F. v. Muell), sehiega (Celtis latifolia Planch.), sehiye (Sterculia macrophylla Vent.), susu (Alstonia scholaris R. Br.), and bimiek (Pterocymbium beccarii K. Schum.). Particular attention is directed to penetration and retention requirement/or wood uses under roof and outdoor without soil contact. Solution concentration of BFCA preservative used was 30 percent. Among ten wood species tested, only one species (sehye) could not be treated by dip diffusion process in 30 percent solution, because retention requirement for use under roof without soil contact (condition A) could not be reached. Two of the remaining nine wood species which could be treated by dip diffusion process and hence fulfilling the requirement for uses under condition B were raja and sehiega <b>woods.</b> <b>Storage</b> phase proposed for bemoe, raja and sehiega wood is 8 weeks, while for six other wood species (wafut, stark a, senai, sutiet, susu and bimiek) is 4 weeks. During storage phase, severe attack of blue-stain on seven wood species were observed, while the remaining three species which were not affected were senai, sehiega and bimiek wood.

30|$|Sprinkling {{wood with}} {{water is a}} common method for {{protecting}} <b>wood</b> during <b>storage,</b> yet the polluted runoff generated by the log yard is a major drawback. To study bark’s ability to leach pollutants from logs, the Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, and Betula pubescens wood species were submerged with and without bark for 6  weeks. The water was analysed during the study for total organic carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, colour, pH, and distillable phenols. The {{results showed that the}} leaching from carefully debarked wood is lower than that of both gently debarked wood and intact wood. Storing carefully debarked logs is a viable method for reducing pollutants in log yard runoff.|$|R

50|$|Treasure No. 66, Seokbinggo, is {{a famous}} icehouse. It is 2.4 meters in width, 1.78 meters in height, and 18.8 meters in length. The {{entrance}} {{is located in}} the south and three ventilation ducts were built in the arched roof. The floor is angled in an incline so that melting ice water flows toward the floor. Originally the ice storehouse was in the west of Wolseong but has been moved to its present location near the northern castle turret. The icehouse was used during the Joseon Dynasty. Records inscribed on stone state that Jo Myeonggyeom replaced the older <b>wood</b> ice <b>storage</b> house with one made of stone during the reign of King Yeongjo and then moved the icehouse to the west of Wolseong. The storage facility is considered important for its architectural technique and the magnitude of the structure.|$|R
