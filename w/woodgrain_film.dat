When Chevrolet proposed a simulated woodgrain option for the Chevy Vega Kammback wagon for the 1973 model year, after a gap of four years of applying <b>woodgrain</b> <b>film</b> on the Caprice, the Vega's production schedule made smooth application of the applique difficult without wrinkles and heavy scrappage [...] - [...] requiring retraining by the film supplier, 3M. [...] Subsequent rebadged variants of the Vega (marketed as [...] "Woody"), including the Pontiac Astre Safari, Chevrolet Monza Estate and Pontiac Sunbird Safari, also offered simulated wood trim.
