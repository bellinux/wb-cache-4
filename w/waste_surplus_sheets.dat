The ability of Y. lipolytica W 29 to produce microbial oils and other compounds (lipase and citric acid) from waste cooking oils (WCO) and animal fat (lard) was evaluated {{and the effect of}} several factors were assessed by an experimental design. OTR and pH was by far the most influential parameters for microbial oils production by Y. lipolytica W 29 from lard and from WCO, respectively. Regardless of hydrophobic substrate used, the yeast oil content obtained (58 % from lard and 53 % from WCO) was one of the higher ever reported for a non-genetically modified Y. lipolytica strain. The unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acids ratio of these microbial oils is higher than in initial substrate, which indicates that they can be interesting as a potential source to food supplements. Besides intracellular lipids accumulation, a simultaneous production of lipase (from WCO) and citric acid and lipase (from lard) was observed, demonstrating that a biorefinery approach may be designed based on fat raw materials, allowing {{at the same time the}} reduction of fatty <b>wastes</b> <b>surplus.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

To reduce operational costs, a key factor is the availability of an inexpensive source of heat, such as that coming from an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant. However, {{how much of the}} digestate can be processed with the heat produced by the cogeneration unit? The aim {{of this study was to}} test vacuum evaporation for the treatment of cattle slurry digestate focusing on heat exploitation. Tests were performed with a pilot plant evaporator fed with the digestate of a full-scale AD plant. The results were used to evaluate if and how the cogeneration heat can support both the AD plant and the subsequent evaporation of the whole daily digestate production in a full-scale plant. The concentrate obtained (12 % total solids) represents 40 – 50 % of the influent. The heat requirement is 0. 44 kWh/kg condensate. Heat power availability exceeding the needs of the digestor ranges from 325 (in winter) to 580 kW (in summer) versus the 382 kW required for processing the whole digestate production. To by-pass fluctuations, we propose to use the heat coming from the cogenerator directly in the evaporator, tempering the digestor with the latent heat of distillation vapor...|$|R

We envision in this paper that future TN (as well as any other ICT application) will interact with the SG, enabling (1) the TN to know the energy source and cost that is currently powering its equipment, (2) to turn the TN into an active client which can request to the SG the quantity and quality (e. g. green) of energy that it needs, and (3) a service orchestration between SG supply system and TN operations. As a consequence, the enabled interoperability between TN and SG would allow TN to take energy-aware management decisions in function of energy-related information provided by the SG. For example, TN can route packets with the objective of optimizing green criteria, while SG can route the energy towards the TN clients with the objective of not <b>wasting</b> <b>surpluses</b> of green energy.

40|$|In Los Angeles (LA), {{food waste}} is at record levels. This has {{negative}} outcomes for food insecurity, land use, and methane production associated with climate change. To overcome these challenges, {{a range of}} government, private, and civil society organizations (CSOs) have developed programs to reduce food waste. With the decentralization, privatization, and devolution of food waste policies to local actors, CSOs have emerged as key institutions in the governance of food waste in many contexts. However, {{it is unclear whether}} CSOs have the capacity to reduce food waste and food insecurity, empower communities, or promote social change. To this end, this paper critically analyzes a local food rescue CSO as a case study {{in order to understand the}} challenges associated with food waste governance in LA and the roles that CSOs play in food waste reduction. Through an analysis of interview and participant observation data in LA’s food system, this paper examines the ways that food waste is produced, regulated, and reused by institutions in LA. Findings illustrate that although local CSOs have expanded their food waste reduction programs, the impact of their operations may be limited. In addition, while CSOs rescue some food, they operate in conjunction with food <b>waste</b> <b>surpluses</b> and the overabundance of food, and do little to reduce the root cause of food waste or food insecurity. Although the structural causes of food waste are arguably beyond the scope of some CSOs to change, data in this paper suggest that some CSOs may contribute indirectly to neoliberal governance when they romanticize the power of local communities, depoliticize food issues, and focus on individual personal responsibility. For these reasons, this research suggests that food waste may only be reduced significantly with more government regulation of the institutions which produce food waste, namely food businesses and households...|$|R

40|$|Book of Abstracts of CEB Annual Meeting 2017 Yarrowia lipolytica, a {{strictly}} aerobic yeast, with GRAS status, has an intense secretory activity and can metabolize {{a wide range}} of substrates that guaranteed a spot as an interesting industrial organism. Recently, food supplements derived from this yeast were approved for commercialization, which is particularly important for broadening the range of possible applications of the compounds produced by Y. lipolytica [1]. Within “Bioprocess Development and Optimization” research team, Y. lipolytica {{has been used as a}} cell model and exploited applying the biorefinery concept for the production of enzymes, microbial lipids, aroma and organic acids, using low-cost renewable substrates. A yeast-based integrated system was developed to valorize agro-industrial wastes, namely waste cooking oils and lard (used as a model of animal fat), by producing microbial lipids and lipase. The yeast oil content accumulated by Y. lipolytica from these inexpensive wastes was one of the higher ever reported for a non-genetically modified Yarrowia strain. Moreover, the simultaneous production of lipase may reduce the production cost of the microbial lipids and demonstrates that a biorefinery approach may be designed based on fat raw materials, allowing at the same time the reduction of fatty <b>wastes</b> <b>surplus.</b> Lipids accumulation on Y. lipolytica may also occur from non-oily substrates such as glucose or glycerol that can also lead to citric acid (CA) production under nitrogen-limitation conditions. Crude glycerol, byproduct from Biodiesel industry, has been used for CA production. Optimization of CA has been carried out by enhancing oxygen transfer rate at different types of bioreactors, such as STR, pressurized and airlift, as well as by mutagenesis strategies for strains improvement. Yarrowia lipolytica is a model microorganism for lipids metabolism. It can produce several compounds from fatty acids catabolism, mainly aromatic compounds, such as lactones. This species is able to transform ricinoleic acid into γ-decalactone, a peach-like aroma compound of great importance for flavoring industry. The production of γ-decalactone has been intensively studied in order to better understand all process and optimize it. The role of lipases in substrate hydrolysis, the effect of substrate concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration and different fermentation strategies - batch and stepwise fed-batch – and bioreactor designs (STR and airlift) in the γ-decalactone production was investigated [2]. The characterization of γ-decalactone production by genetic modified strains at labscale bioreactor was also performed.

I develop an analysis of waste policy as a dimension of capitalist surplus management (after Sweezy, 1962) by reconfiguring Claus Offe’s (1984) essay on the state and social policy and construe waste policy as effecting a ‘lasting transformation’ of non-accumulating capital into accumulating capital.
