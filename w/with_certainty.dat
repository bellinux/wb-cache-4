5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority.

5|$|Although it is {{not known}} <b>with</b> <b>certainty</b> how the spores are {{disperse}}d, they may disperse passively in the water, or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float on the water surface for dispersal. L.incarnatum is homothallic, a mode of reproduction commonly employed by marine fungi that may confer a competitive advantage in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} <b>with</b> <b>certainty,</b> {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, {{but because of the}} nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known <b>with</b> <b>certainty.</b> Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E

Nothing further is known of him <b>with</b> <b>certainty,</b> although he can possibly be identified with the patricius Germanus, a leading senator in the reign of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) whose daughter married Maurice's eldest son Theodosius. Michael Whitby identifies the younger Germanus with Germanus, a son-in-law of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was first}} staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's {{but that of}} Niccolò Bajetti.

5|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, {{additional}} {{arms were}} attributed to {{a large number of}} saints, kings and popes, especially those from the 11th and 12th centuries.

5|$|Teratological (developmentally abnormal) {{forms of}} H.aurantiaca were {{reported}} {{to occur in the}} United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with a wrinkled upper surface of convoluted gill tissue. The overall morphology of these forms somewhat resembles species of Clavariadelphus. Although the cause of this abnormal development is not known <b>with</b> <b>certainty,</b> environmental pollutants or virus infection have been suggested as contributing factors.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper.

5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} <b>with</b> <b>certainty.</b> One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread.

5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification {{in being able}} to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only every genus has something peculiar to itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost <b>with</b> <b>certainty.</b>|$|E
