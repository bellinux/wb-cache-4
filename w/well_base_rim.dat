50|$|Most alloy {{wheels are}} {{manufactured}} using casting, {{but some are}} forged. Forged wheels are usually lighter, stronger, but much more expensive than cast wheels. There {{are two types of}} forged wheels: one piece and modular. Modular forged wheels may feature two- or three-piece design. Typical multi-piece wheels consist of the inner <b>rim</b> <b>base,</b> outer <b>rim</b> lip and wheel center piece with openings for lug nuts. All parts of a modular wheel are held with bolts. BBS RS {{is one of the most}} famous three-piece modular forged wheels.|$|R
50|$|Rimfire is {{a method}} of {{ignition}} for metallic firearm cartridges {{as well as the}} cartridges themselves. It is called rimfire because the firing pin of a gun strikes and crushes the <b>base's</b> <b>rim</b> to ignite the primer. The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap which contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet). Once the rim of the cartridge has been struck and the bullet discharged, the cartridge cannot be reloaded, because the head has been deformed by the firing pin impact. While many other different cartridge priming methods have been tried since the 19th century, only rimfire technology and centerfire technology survive today in significant use.|$|R

40|$|DE 102009030377 A 1 UPAB: 20110117 NOVELTY - The {{absorber}} has a <b>rim</b> <b>base</b> (1), {{on which}} a tire is mounted. An absorption volume i. e. air volume (6), is integrated into the rim, and an external profile is provided for mounting the tire on the <b>rim</b> <b>base,</b> so that bumps are not externally provided in an inner circumferential edge (2) and an outer circumferential edge (3) of the <b>rim</b> <b>base.</b> A micro-perforation is provided in the <b>rim</b> <b>base,</b> and absorption volume is provided on a side that is turned away from a tire cavity. The absorption volume is partitioned along a circumference by bars. USE - Sound absorber i. e. micro-perforated sound absorber, for vehicle wheels. ADVANTAGE - The external profile is provided for mounting the tire on the rim, so that the bumps are not externally provided in the edge areas of the rim, thus ensuring easy mounting of the tire on the rim. The bumps are designed in a manner such that the bumps can stabilize the installed tire on the rim and prevent slipping of the tire. The absorber is designed in a manner such that absorber exhibits better characteristics for sound absorption...|$|R

40|$|The {{versatility}} of cationic cyclopentadienyliron complexes {{is demonstrated}} for {{the generation of}} calix[4]arene-based dendrimers and polymers. Dendrimers were prepared from a branched organoiron calix[4]arene through subsequent reactions of azo dyes and organoiron complexes. The resulting azo dye-containing metallocalix[4]arenes were soluble in polar organic solvents and displayed λ(max) ranging between 430 and 456 [*]nm. Upon addition of various acids, the λ(max) shifted to higher wavelengths (513 - 535 [*]nm). In the solid state and in solution, the azo dye-containing metallocalix[4]arenes reversibly changed colour {{in the presence of}} acid and base, indicating their potential use as acid sensors. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed that the iron centres of the metallocalix[4]arenes were reversibly reduced at E(1 / 2) [*]=[*]- 1. 49 [*]V. When non-branching organoiron-based calix[4]arene were reacted with dithiols, polymers containing calix[4]arenes either in their side chains or main chains were obtained. The polymers possessed weight average molecular weights between 35 000 and 53 000. The polymers were determined to be thermally stable with backbone decomposition occurring above 500 [*]°C.
