Originally, the area <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> became Yamhill County, but was transferred to the current Clackamas County in 1855. The first post office was established in 1876 with the name, Boones Ferry.|$|E

But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one hell of a mistake.|$|E

500|$|With {{the fall}} of the government, Disraeli and the Conservatives {{returned}} to the opposition benches. Disraeli would spend three-quarters of his 44-year parliamentary career in opposition. Derby was reluctant to seek to unseat the government, fearing a repetition of the Who? Who? Ministry and knowing that despite his lieutenant's strengths, shared dislike of Disraeli <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had formed the governing coalition. Disraeli, on the other hand, was anxious to return to office. [...] In the interim, Disraeli, as Conservative leader in the Commons, opposed the government on all major measures.|$|E

It was released as a bonus track for the Japanese version of Grande's sophomore album My Everything, featuring Japanese musician Taro Hakase. The song features new arrangements in the background instrumental, with Hakaro playing violin during the whole song. This version was the second credits theme for the 2014–2015 anime series GO-GO Tamagotchi!, making it the only song in that series not to be sung in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|Some {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked in the movie business. Like Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets, which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink. Ethan explained in 1998: [...] "I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture.... That <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> got us going on the whole Barton Fink thing." [...] Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called Flesh (1932), which starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.|$|E

[...] In MLL, he was traded to the Baltimore Bayhawks, where he earned his first Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game selection in 2005 and a MLL Championship. [...] In 2006, Tierney <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is believed to have been}} the largest trade in professional sports, involving 6 teams and 24 players when he was traded from the Bayhawks to the Denver Outlaws. [...] He earned two more All-Star selections in 2006 and 2007 with the Outlaws, before becoming their defensive coordinator in 2008. Tierney retired from active play due to a series of concussions. The final career-ending concussion occurred during warm-ups on June 16, 2007 against the Rochester Rattlers.|$|E

500|$|Comedy Central {{originally}} ordered {{only six}} episodes of South Park {{for the first}} season's initial run. However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing. That <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we wanted (to say). I think kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E
500|$|In any case, {{the aging}} blind blues player Jimmie Strothers {{recorded}} the song, as [...] "The Blood-Strained Banders", sometimes called [...] "Keep Away from the Bloodstained Banders", for Alan Lomax and Harold Spivacke {{on behalf of}} the Library of Congress in June 1936. [...] (The name was probably a corruption of [...] "Blood Stained Bandits".) [...] Strothers accompanied himself on four-string banjo, an instrument upon which his skill was well regarded. [...] Coming from the Appalachian part of Virginia, Strothers had lost his sight in a mine explosion and had made a living playing on street corners and in medicine shows. [...] Blind, itinerant street singers like Strothers were part of the tradition that kept African-American religious music alive. [...] The recording was made at the Virginia State Prison Farm near Goochland, Virginia, where Strothers was serving time for having murdered his wife. (Although sometimes described as having murdered his wife with an axe, in letters to Governor of Virginia James H. Price requesting pardon Strothers wrote that he shot his wife with a pistol in self-defense. The pardon was granted in 1939.) Lomax thought prisons were a good place to find old songs, and was also interested in illustrating the interaction of white and black music. This haunting recording <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Allmusic describes as a [...] "group of songs that explore the boundaries between the sacred and the profane." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what the answer would be.|$|E
