5|$|Bush {{also wrote}} and made demos {{of close to}} 200 songs, a few of <b>which</b> <b>today</b> {{can be found on}} bootleg {{recordings}} and are known as the Phoenix Recordings. From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses around London – specifically at the Rose of Lee public house (now Dirty South) in Lewisham. The other three band members were Del Palmer (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977, although two tracks had been recorded during the summer of 1975.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Stone and Blackwell {{moved from}} New Jersey to Dorchester, Massachusetts, <b>which</b> <b>today</b> is a {{neighborhood}} of Boston just south of downtown. There they purchased Pope's Hill, a seventeen-room house with extensive grounds and several outbuildings. Many of the town's women had {{been active in the}} Dorchester Female Anti-Slavery Society and, by 1870, a number of local women were suffragists.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale's Cutoff and part of it is {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, <b>which</b> <b>today</b> is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E

5|$|Sigeberht of East Anglia (also {{known as}} Saint Sigebert), (Old English: Sigebryht) was a saint and a king of East Anglia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom <b>which</b> <b>today</b> {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. He {{was the first}} English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession {{and the first to}} abdicate in order to enter the monastic life. The principal source for Sigeberht is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which was completed in the 730s.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Tolkien's books {{has had a}} small but lasting effect {{on the use of}} language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, <b>which</b> <b>today</b> commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings dwarves and dwarvish (alongside dwarfs and dwarfish), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the Old English plural survived, it would have been dwarrows or dwerrows.) He also coined the term eucatastrophe, though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{starting line}} is in Whitehorse on First Avenue, near the former White Pass and Yukon Route train station, <b>which</b> <b>today</b> houses the Canadian offices of Yukon Quest International. Shortly {{after leaving the}} starting line, racers follow the frozen Yukon River north out of town. Crossing onto the Takhini River, mushers follow it north to the Klondike-era Overland Trail. Racers take the trail to Braeburn Lodge, the first checkpoint.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} days of settlement, the land that is now Rutherford was part of New Barbadoes Township, as Berry had lived in Barbados, another English colony, before {{claiming}} his grant in New Jersey. New Barbadoes was part of Essex County from 1693 to 1710, when Bergen County was formed. In 1826, the land became part of Lodi Township (of <b>which</b> <b>today's</b> remaining portion is now South Hackensack). When Hudson County was formed in 1840, the area that is today North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford and East Rutherford became part of Harrison Township (of <b>which</b> <b>today's</b> remaining portion is Harrison town). However, the area reverted to Bergen County in 1852 and became known as Union Township.|$|R
50|$|Founded before 1280 as Schola Duisburgensis, {{the school}} was {{transformed}} into a Latin school in 1559, <b>which</b> <b>today's</b> Landfermann-Gymnasium acknowledges as its official founding year.

5|$|Two London Underground {{stations}} were once named Strand: a Piccadilly line station (which was renamed Aldwych station) that operated between 1907 and 1994 {{and a former}} Northern line station <b>which</b> <b>today</b> forms part of Charing Cross station. 'Strand Bridge' was the name given to Waterloo Bridge during its construction; it was renamed for its official opening on {{the second anniversary of}} the coalition victory in the Battle of Waterloo. London Bus routes 6, 23, 139 and 176 all run along the Strand, as do numerous night bus services.|$|E
5|$|Tytila (died around 616) was a semi-historical pagan king of East Anglia, a small Anglo-Saxon kingdom <b>which</b> <b>today</b> {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Early sources, including Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, identify {{him as an}} early member of the Wuffingas dynasty who succeeded his father Wuffa. A later chronicle dates his reign from 578, {{but he is not}} known to have definitely ruled as king and nothing of his life is known. He is listed in a number of genealogical lists.|$|E
5|$|With {{support of}} the Kiev city authorities, architect-restorer Y. Lositskiy and others {{restored}} {{the western part of}} the stone walls. The belltower was restored next and became an observation platform. Instead of the original chiming clock, a new electronic one with hands and a set of chimes (a total of 40) was installed from <b>which</b> <b>today</b> the melodies of famous Ukrainian composers can be heard. The Cathedral was reconstructed last and decorated with a set of wooden baroque icons, copies of former mosaics and frescoes, and new works of art by Ukrainian artists.|$|E

5|$|Æthelberht (Old English: Æðelbrihte), {{also called}} Saint Ethelbert the King, (died 20 May 794 at Sutton Walls, Herefordshire) was an eighth-century saint and a king of East Anglia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom <b>which</b> <b>today</b> {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Little {{is known of}} his reign, which may have begun in 779, according to later sources, and {{very few of the}} coins issued during his reign have been discovered. It is known from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that he was killed on the orders of Offa of Mercia in 794.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the city}} and the horizon are several rural islands, <b>which</b> <b>today</b> form part of central Stockholm. Behind the church and the castle is Skeppsholmen, which for centuries served as a base for the Swedish Navy {{together}} with Kastellholmen islet, which can be seen above the Blackfriars monastery. To the left of Skeppsholmen are two small islets, which are today merged into the peninsula of Blasieholmen. Behind these islands are Djurgården (right), Östermalm, and Norra Djurgården (left). On the horizon, the Lilla Värtan strait passes in front of Lidingö and, arguably, the interior islands of the Stockholm archipelago.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 7th century, southern England was almost entirely {{under the control of the}} Anglo-Saxons. These peoples, who are known to have included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the conquered territories, including the Kingdom of the East Angles, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom <b>which</b> <b>today</b> includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Almost no documentary sources exist about the history of the kingdom before the reign of Rædwald, who reigned until about 624. Sources of information include the names of a few of the early Wuffing kings, mentioned in a short passage in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in the 730s.|$|E

5|$|From the 13th to 20th century, {{there were}} Swedish-speaking {{communities}} in Estonia, {{particularly on the}} islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) {{along the coast of}} the Baltic, communities <b>which</b> <b>today</b> have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E
5|$|In 1750, now well-known, the {{architect}} received an important commission to remodel Euston Hall in East Anglia, the Suffolk country {{seat of the}} influential 2nd Duke of Grafton. The original house, built circa 1666 in the French style, was built around a central court with large pavilions at each corner. While keeping the original layout, Brettingham formalised the fenestration and imposed a more classically severe order whereby the pavilions were transformed to towers in the Palladian fashion (similar to those of Inigo Jones's at Wilton House). The pavilions' domes were replaced by low pyramid roofs similar to those at Holkham. Brettingham also created the large service courtyard at Euston that now acts as the entrance court to the mansion, <b>which</b> <b>today</b> is {{only a fraction of}} its former size.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{today has}} more than 421 {{municipal}} parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees. Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden, created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace, and redone by André Le Nôtre between 1664 and 1672, and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, <b>which</b> <b>today</b> houses the French Senate. The Jardin des Plantes was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626 by Louis XIII's doctor Guy de La Brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants.|$|E
