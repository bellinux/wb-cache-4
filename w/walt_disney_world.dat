5|$|Disney's {{plans for}} the futuristic city of EPCOT {{did not come to}} fruition. After Disney's death, his brother Roy {{deferred}} his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies.

In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco. Thousands of artifacts from Disney's life and career are on display, including numerous awards that he received.
