Its idyllic music blends mellow soul and glitchy hip hop, featuring a chopped sample of Curtis Mayfield's 1972 song [...] "Freddie's Dead". The song's lyrics envision {{a higher degree of}} African-American identity. Its vocalists ask in refrain, [...] "What if there was no niggas, only master teachers?", and answering [...] "I stay woke", with Badu responding [...] "I'm in the search of something new / Search inside me, searching inside you". Midway through the song, Poyser's keyboards lower the music's tempo, with a fluid, jazzy sound. [...] "That Hump" [...] concerns the topic of drug dependency. The closing track [...] "Telephone" [...] is a tribute to J Dilla, who died in 2006 from complications with blood disorder, and has themes of sorrow and hope. It serves as a departure from the preceding songs' edgier musical direction, featuring soft melodies and an acoustic feel similar to Badu's live sound. The song opens with the sound of ominous sirens, referencing J Dilla's 2006 album Donuts. The song's lyrics are based on a story told to Badu by J Dilla's mother on the day of his death. Poyser explained in an interview, [...] "Dilla's mom told Erykah about one day when he <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> about this dream he had where Ol'Dirty was telling him to get on a different color bus and giving him directions home". According to Poyser, the song's music was inspired by Dilla's passing: ...|$|E
2500|$|Skeptics such as Paul Kurtz and Ray Hyman {{say that}} DuBois {{does not have}} psychic powers. Skeptic James Randi says that people such as DuBois give the {{appearance}} of psychic powers through cold reading techniques. For example, DuBois, when doing her first reading of Schwartz, told him that his deceased friend <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "I don't walk alone," [...] which Schwartz understood to be a reference to his friend's confinement to a wheelchair, which DuBois could not have known about. Randi says that Schwartz leapt to an unsupportable conclusion, since the notion of [...] "not walking alone" [...] can mean any number of things, and [...] "certainly does not describe being in a wheelchair." [...] Randi also asserts that experiments that allegedly yield positive results of psychic powers, such as the ones done with DuBois, are not conducted using proper scientific controls. In light of Schwartz's assertion that [...] "some" [...] of his experiments with DuBois were performed under such conditions, Randi questions why the rest of them were not, and points to a report demonstrating that a few of Schwartz's experiments were not performed according to standard scientific protocol. Schwartz's point-by-point response to Randi's criticisms was published in 2005.|$|E

We can kinda roll that out and drop her new single in late spring. Excited about that." [...] Love {{also said that he}} wanted to continue developing an R sound with Rowland, following the US chart success of her single [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011), which he co-wrote and co-produced. [...] "I believe in R and I believe that if we make new age records and don't make dated records and keep it classic, I think we'll be fine." [...] Rowland also worked with Amber [...] "Se7en" [...] Streeter, Da Internz, Eric Bellinger, Eric Hudson, Kevin Cossom, Lonny Bereal, Nikeshia Briscoe, Redd Stylez, Rock City, [...] T-Minus, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, The Runners and Beau Vallis. On March 23, 2012, Rowland confirmed via Twitter that she was working with rapper T-Pain. Sean Garrett revealed in an interview with Rap-Up on May 9, 2012 that he also contributed to the album. He stated, [...] "Her swag is dope and I'm just so happy to see her get her shot. I'ma do what I can to make sure Kelly right." [...] In August 2012, Grammy-winning songwriter Diane Warren mentioned her involvement, stating that she had been working with Rowland [...] "because Beyoncé <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> to get together with me".|$|E
