5|$|Building on {{the success}} of Lad: A Dog, Terhune went on to pen thirty {{additional}} canine novels, including two featuring Lad. Further Adventures of Lad, which includes the stories of his arrival at the Place and his death, was published in George H. Doran in 1922. Like the first, it {{went on to become a}} best seller, praised by both new readers and existing fans. Critics, however, gave it more mixed reviews. Though some praised the stories and Lad, others felt Lad <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> and harshly denounced Terhune's writing style. Lad of Sunnybank was released in 1929 by HarperCollins, and included another selection of stories about Lad's life. Two of the collies that appear in Lad: A Dog, Lad's son Wolf and another collie named Bruce, both received their own novels. Bruce was published by E. P. Dutton in 1920 and Wolf was published by Doran in 1925.|$|E

Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC praised Longoria for turning what he said could have been a gloomy story into [...] "a gleeful fantasy". Cooper said the character was fun and funny but ultimately heartfelt and caring. Conversely, Cooper said the subplots involving the other housewives were [...] "all pretty standard, and dreary, stuff".|$|E
500|$|For {{several years}} after he had turned 40, Miller {{concentrated}} on composing and playing his own music. He therefore reduced his recording and club appearances, as well as one-day associations. The stimulus for this change had built gradually from Miller's first studio recording in 1981: [...] "my recording activity increased {{and by the time}} that it got into 1986–87 I was on so many records it <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> until eventually it became rather overwhelming and stressful, so I had to cut back."

500|$|Of Easy Jet's stamina {{and busy}} {{training}} regimen, Merrick said, [...] "I guess he ate at night; I don't know when else.

[...] Easy Jet was so easy to train that Merrick decided to oversee the training himself rather than send the horse away to a professional trainer. In a practice race at the ranch, Merrick matched the yearling against Jet Smooth. Although his elder brother had the advantage of previous race experience, Easy Jet won the 350-yard (320m) race. Easy Jet's performance prompted Merrick to enter him in a yearling race at Blue Ribbon Downs, which the colt won by more than a length.|$|E
