Its {{just one of those}} 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody. We wanted to keep it loose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though." [...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to hear?'. That's really all I did. Everything's [...] got so repetitive, everything sounds the same. I had to create something unique otherwise there's no point putting it out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I want no thanks," [...] he answered, almost roughly.

40|$|How can I {{choose the}} best {{electronic}} healthrecord (EHR) system for my practice? Un-til recently, the best response consisted of answering several more focused questions, including the following: <b>What</b> problems <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to solve? <b>What</b> features <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want?</b> <b>What</b> implementation schedule <b>do</b> <b>I</b> wish to follow? Today, the process of EHR selection is very different given new Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) policies {{and other health care}} developments. There are now strong monetary incentives to use EHRs, but there are also potential penalties, in the form of reduced payments, if EHRs are not adopted. 1 For many physicians, the short answer to the question is now: “Whatever CMS mandates. ” ABOUT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD...|$|R
