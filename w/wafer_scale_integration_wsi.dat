This research examines the problem of constructing chips up {{to the size of the}} <b>wafer</b> (<b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration)</b> that operate correctly despite the occurrence of such flaws. We concentrate on a particular family of parallel processors, configurable, highly parallel (CHiP) processors. ^ The key problem in the implementation of <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> is structuring the wafer so that only the functional PEs are connected together. A methodology, the two level hierarchy, that efficiently and economically solves the structuring problem for CHiP processors is presented. The principle elements are the use of column exclusion with high yield building blocks that contain redundant components. This approach limits the performance degradation due to structuring and allows the structuring problem to be solved with tractable computational effort. ^ Since the yield of building blocks must be high for the two level hierarchy to be a practical approach, yield phenomena are investigated in detail. A model of the integrated circuit manufacturing process is developed that predicts circuit yield and the probability distribution of manufacturing defects. These results are applied to the analysis of parallel processors in which several PEs occupy a single chip. In addition, they are used to design the building blocks meeting the requirements of the column exclusion strategy. ^ It was shown that these building blocks can be assembled into a <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> CHiP processor.

To accommodate this need three main possibilities can be explored: <b>Wafer</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>Integration</b> (<b>WSI),</b> Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI), and Three Dimensional Integration (3 DI). A brief review of these techniques along with their comparative advantages and disadvantages is presented. It has been concluded that 3 DI technology is superior to others. Therefore, an attempt is made to develop a viable fabrication process for this technology. This is done by first reviewing the current technologies that are utilized for fabrication of Integrated Circuits (ICs) and their compatibility with 3 DI stringent requirements.;Based on this review, a set of fabrication procedure for realization of 3 DI technology, are presented in chapter 3. In Chapter 1 the compatibility of the currently used devices, such as BJTs and FETS, with 3 DI technology is examined. Moreover, a new active device is developed for 3 DI technology to replace BJTs and FETs in circuits. This new device is more compatible to the constrains of 3 DI technology. Chapter 2 is devoted to solving the overall problems of 3 DI circuits. The problem of heat and power dispassion and signal coupling (Cross-Talk) between the layers are reviewed, and an inter-layer shield is proposed to overcome these problems. The effectiveness of such a thin shield is considered theoretically. In Chapter 3 a fabrication process for 3 DI technology is proposed.

Four issues in the VAR system are studied: (1) {{the development of a}} CAD framework for reconfigurable architectures, (2) the development of an array model, and its VHDL description and simulation, (3) the development of efficient fault diagnosis techniques, and (4) the development of a systematic method for evaluating architectures and yield. The first issue describes the modules in the CAD framework and their functionalities. The second issue addresses the hierarchical VHDL description and simulation of the array model, and the detailed designs of its components. The third issue proposes two fault diagnosis algorithms based on the parallel partition approach and the self-comparison approach respectively, and an optimal group diagnosis procedure. These fault diagnosis techniques all have the contribution of reducing testing time significantly under different application scenarios. The fourth issue depicts a complete set of figures of merits for quantitative architecture and yield evaluation. Although an easily diagnosable and reconfigurable two-dimensional defect tolerant array is used as an example to illustrate the methodology of VAR, the VAR environment can be equally applied to other parallel architectures. VAR allows the designers to study and evaluate fault diagnosis and reconfiguration algorithms by inserting faults, which are generated according to actual manufacturing yield data, into the array and then locating the faulty elements as well as simulating the reconfiguration process. Thus, VAR can assist the designers in evaluating different combinations of fault patterns, fault diagnosis and reconfiguration techniques, and reconfigurable architectures through the figures of merit with aim at architectural improvements. Extensive simulation and evaluation have been performed to demonstrate and support the effectiveness of VAR. The results from this research can drive the applications of large area VLSI or WSI closer to reality and result in producing low cost and high yield parallel architectures...|$|R
40|$|Regular arrays, {{particularly}} systolic arrays, {{have been}} the subject of continuous interest for the past 15 years. One reason is that they present an excellent example of the unity between hardware and software, especially for application-specific computations. This results in a cost effective implementation of systolic algorithms in hardware, in VLSI chips or on FPGAs. To the present time, systolic/regular arrays have primarily been considered as 2 -D structures. The chief purposes of this work are: (i) to develop methods to transform an algorithm into a form that fits the 3 -D physical construction of the processor and is easy to fabricate; (ii) to find ways of increasing the available degree of parallelism and thus improve scalability and latency. For this purpose, we propose multidimensional piecewise regular arrays: arrays of loosely connected subarrays of lower dimensionality where two different clock rates are used. One, a high clock rate, is used inside subarrays, e. g. inside VLSI chips, and the other, a low clock rate, is used in the interconnection part of subarrays. These properties permit easy physical realization of n-D large arrays, as the n-D array is formed from (n- 1) -D subarrays that are connected to each other only by edges using a low clock rate. Thus, 3 -D arrays that consist of 2 -D arrays are easily fabricated, e. g. using multichip modules, <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> etc. While several of the approaches that we use to achieve our aims have been considered in the literature, they have unfortunately been studied separately and without a unified approach. We combine our approach with commonly used synthesizing methods for regular arrays: with space-time transformations on polytopes. The approach we propose can be used for all associative and commutative problems. The thesis presents the synthesis of large variety of new, higher-dimensional arrays. The two main issues involved in addition to the existing methods in the polytope model are: (1) In order to achieve a higher degree of parallelism, and to decrease latency, we increase the dimensionality of the source representation of the program by partitioning the range of indices. (2) We introduce a method for developing pipestructures (an extension of pipelines) for spreading the shared data between distinct computations and for gathering partial results in the case of a reduction operator. As an example, we consider template matching on systolic arrays. A 2 -D mesh of linear arrays [...] - conventional systolic arrays for 1 -D convolution [...] - that exploits two different clock rates is presented...|$|R
40|$|Magnetoresistive {{memory has}} been {{identified}} as a viable candidate for water <b>scale</b> <b>integration.</b> Water <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> requires an architecture which tolerates defects with redundant elements. A <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> architecture with multiple levels of redundancy is designed for magnetoresistive memory. Yield models which consider multiple types of defects and defect clustering are used to calculate module and wafer level yields. The yields of various redundancy combinations are simulated to optimize the architecture for current semiconductor manufacturing processes. The optimized redundancy has six spares at the 16 Kbit module level and two spares at the 1 Mbit module level. This architecture yields a capacity of over 250 megabytes for all the statistical processing distributions considered in the simulation. The areal cost of the redundancy is less than 10 percent...|$|R
