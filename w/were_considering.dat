5|$|By 2008 many Democrats <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> this {{approach}} {{as the basis}} for healthcare reform. Experts said that the legislation that eventually emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 bore similarities to the 2007 bill and that it was deliberately patterned after Romney's state healthcare plan.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{appointed}} to captain an Australian XI in a warm-up match against the touring Englishmen, indicating that the selectors <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> him for the Test captaincy. Harvey scored a duck and 38 and the Australians lost heavily by 345 runs on a wicket with a crater. Therefore, Benaud was made Australian captain ahead of Harvey.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{announced}} in February1993 that they <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> taking over ownership and {{operations of the}} airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Widerøe articulated that Båtsfjord Airport {{did not meet the}} demands for future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash8, which would be phased in between 1993 and 1995, they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. The CAA stated, instead, that the new airport should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main reason was that the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April1994 the ministry stated that they <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> closing many of the smallest regional airports, including Båtsfjord.|$|E
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{airlines}} <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> upgrading their aging Douglas DC-8 aircraft as {{an alternative}} to buying new quieter and more efficient aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by United Airlines to upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and SNECMA were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and Delta Air Lines and Flying Tiger Line soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm footing in both the military and commercial realms.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{broadcasting}} {{the series}} in Victoria, Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution. The first episode was made available on torrent sites within 20minutes of it concluding in New South Wales. The Nine Network reportedly obtained the IP address of {{the first person to}} upload the show, and network lawyers <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> legal action. The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) was investigating the matter, and was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police. Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance screener versions of the first eight episodes were posted online.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich was {{assigned}} to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime.

For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).|$|E
5|$|Irene cycled between {{apparent}} reintensification {{and significant}} weakening, becoming so disorganized {{in the early}} morning of August 10 that forecasters <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> declaring the storm dissipated. However, the depression continued to move westward into more favorable conditions and again attained tropical storm status, rapidly strengthening to a Category1 hurricane on August 14. Later, it strengthened even further in low shear conditions under an upper level anticyclone. On August 16 it briefly strengthened to a Category2 hurricane, but began to weaken in cooler waters shortly thereafter. It became extratropical southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland on August 18, having never posed a threat to land.|$|E

5|$|Lord Clive, George's {{brother-in-law}} and heir, {{attempted to}} acquire the lease after 1803, citing the efforts that the family had put into restoring the castle.

In 1906, Wilkes-Barre planned to re-sign Neuer, praising his hitting ability {{to the point that they}} <b>were</b> <b>considering</b> trying him out as an outfielder or first baseman.

The President-elect subsequently invited Reverend and Mrs. Cole and their family to attend the inauguration; the family was brought to Washington by the Inaugural Committee.
