50|$|Flame contact welding is a {{very common}} form of welding. The most popular kind of flame contact welding is oxyfuel gas <b>welding.</b> <b>Flame</b> contact welding uses a flame exposed {{to the surface of}} the metals being welded to melt and then join them together. Oxyfuel uses oxygen as a primary {{ignition}} source in tandem with another gas such as acetylene to produce a flame which is 2500oC at the tip and 2800-3500oC at the tip of the inner cone. Other gasses such as propane and methanol can be used for oxyfuel welding. Acetylene is the most common gas used in oxyfuel welding.|$|E
50|$|A {{neutral flame}} is used. A {{reducing}} flame (fuel rich) gives trouble with soot deposits in the <b>weld.</b> An oxidising <b>flame</b> burns {{the lead and}} creates lead oxide dross, leading to poor welds with low malleability.|$|R

By dawn 18 planes were ready. The pilots ate their usual unsatisfactory breakfast of Spam, dried eggs, and coffee. Mitchell, inwardly doubtful of the mission's chances for success, exuded quiet confidence as he chatted with the fliers and ground crew. His last instructions before the 0700 take-off were to maintain radio silence. The Lightnings roared into life and, before getting airborne, trundled to the end of the runway, being so heavily laden. At take-off McLanahan blew a tire and shortly afterwards Moore's new tanks wouldn't feed. These two 'shooters' dropped out of the mission, Raymond Hine and Besby Holmes replaced them.|$|R

40|$|During {{the coal}} pulverizing, the working {{parts of the}} {{ventilation}} mill are being worn by the sand particles. For this reason, the working parts are usually protected with materials resistant to wear (hardfaced/thermal sprayed coatings). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the tribological performance of four different types of coatings as candidates for wear protection of the mill’s working parts. The coatings were produced by using the filler materials with the following nominal chemical composition: NiFeBSi-WC, NiCrBSiC, FeCrCTiSi, and FeCrNiCSiBMn, and by using the plasma arc <b>welding</b> and <b>flame</b> and electric arc spraying processes. The results showed that Ni-based coatings exhibited higher wear resistance than Fe-based coatings. The highest wear resistance showed coating produced by using the NiFeBSi-WC filler material and plasma transferred arc welding deposition process. The hardness was not the only characteristic that affected the wear resistance. In this context, the wear rate of NiFeBSi-WC coating was not in correlation with its hardness, in contrast to other coatings. The different wear performance of NiFeBSi-WC coating was attributed to the different type and morphological features of the reinforcing particles (WC) ...|$|R

Experiments were performed using an oven that allows the analysis of all gases resulted in the welding process, but also enables their monitoring using a video camera, and the resulting film was processed in that the frames for each second of experimentation were extracted. The materials used in the experiments were S 235 JR steel as the base material, and as filler materials, E 70 S. In order {{to assess the impact}} on the work environment of this welding process, the pollution coefficient C P was defined based on the equation of the material balance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the wear {{resistance}} of drill tools, stellite 190 welding coatings were prepared by oxygen-acetylene <b>flame</b> <b>welding</b> technology. The abrasive wear behavior and wear mechanisms of the coatings were investigated in both dry and water friction conditions. The research {{results show that the}} wear losses of the coatings increase with the increase of loads and sliding speeds. The effects of sliding speeds on wear losses of the coatings become intense with the increase of loads. The wear losses of the coatings in water friction condition are bigger than those in dry friction condition. The main wear mechanisms of the coatings are micro-cutting and multi-plastic deformation wear in dry friction condition, and accompanied by stress corrosive wear in water friction condition...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} some {{options for}} weld repairs {{to the outer}} shell of the dome on the U. S. Capitol. During the past 140 years, corrosion products have built up within many of the joints, leading to cracking {{of some of the}} iron castings that form the shell. Since the dome is a national landmark, the goal is to restore the structural integrity of the original castings, replacing as few of the components as is absolutely necessary. While mechanical joining of the fractures or filling of the gaps with epoxy are alternative procedures, a fused (leak-tight) and ductile joint is preferred. A major challenge is that the castings were produced with 1850 's technology, so the composition is far different from current castings that are designed for weld repair. Therefore, we chose to develop some alternative approaches, designed specifically for the dome castings. Of the various options, oxyacetylene braze <b>welding</b> (a <b>flame</b> repair process where the filler metal melts at a temperature below that of the casting) with low-fuming bronze (about 60 Cu- 40 Zn) worked best. The bronze forms joints that are very similar in strength to the castings. A joining trial in July 2002 demonstrated the utility of this technique in the flat and vertical positions at four corner cracks on the dome. More information on the dome material itself is included in a related report...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of the formyl radical (HCO) {{is of great}} interest {{in the field of}} combustion research since it can provide information about the local heat release (HR) rate which is a key parameter in the understanding of combustion processes. Unfortunately, due to the low signal level, HCO planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLTF) has so far not been applicable for single-shot imaging, which is necessary in particular for studying turbulent flames. In the present paper for the first time, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, single-shot PLIF imaging of HCO in flames is demonstrated by employing-a multimode frequency-tripled alexandrite laser. Oil the basis of long pulse duration along with a spectrally broad bandwidth enabling multi-line excitation a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio is achieved. In detail, excitation in the B-X system around 258. 69 nm is applied and subsequent fluorescence detection in the spectral range 300 - 400 nm is performed. A series of experiments concerning spectral interferences, saturation behavior and the influence of flame stoichiometry (in the range phi = 0. 6 - 2) have been conducted. Two typical fuels have been employed: methane (CH 4) as conventional hydrocarbon as well as dimethyl ether (DME) as modern bio fuel. Single-shot HCO imaging is finally demonstrated in a laminar DME/air Bunsen flame and in a slightly turbulent methane/oxygen <b>welding</b> torch <b>flame.</b> The results indicate that the developed HCO PLIF technique offers a strong potential for improved flame Studies particularly in turbulent flames, In general, the approach to employ laser sources with reasonably broader bandwidth and longer pulse duration compared to conventional Nd:YAG pumped systems for PLIF will open up new possibilities in the field of Combustion diagnostics.
