5000|$|<b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>poliomyelitis</b> (WNP), {{an acute}} flaccid {{paralysis}} syndrome associated with WNV infection, is less common than WNM or WNE. This syndrome is generally characterized by the acute onset of asymmetric limb weakness or paralysis {{in the absence of}} sensory loss. Pain sometimes precedes the paralysis. The paralysis can occur in the absence of fever, headache, or other common symptoms associated with WNV infection. Involvement of respiratory muscles, leading to acute respiratory failure, can sometimes occur.|$|E
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} to North America in 1999, human infection with West Nile virus (WNV) {{has resulted in}} considerable acute morbidity and mortality. Although the ongoing epidemic {{has resulted in a}} great increase in our understanding of the acute clinical features of human illness and helped to define associated clinical syndromes, far less is known about potential long-term clinical and functional sequelae. Several recent assessments, however, suggest that patients—even those with apparently mild cases of acute disease—frequently have subjective, somatic complaints following WNV infection. Persistent movement disorders, cognitive complaints, and functional disability may occur after West Nile neuroinvasive disease. <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>poliomyelitis</b> may result in limb weakness and ongoing morbidity that is likely to be long term. Although further assessment is needed, the long-term neurological and functional sequelae of WNV infection are likely to represent a con-siderable source of morbidity in patients long after their recovery from acute illness. The ongoing epidemic of North American West Nile virus (WNV) infection serves as a reminder of the ability of novel viruses to emerge and thrive in unexpected settings. Since its appearance in New York City in 1999, WNV infection has caused considerable acute morbidity and mortality. The num-ber of cases has decreased in recent years; however, the futur...|$|E

50|$|A lethal ovitrap is {{a device}} which attracts gravid female container-breeding {{mosquitoes}} and kills them. The traps halt the insect's life cycle by killing adult insects and stopping reproduction. The original use of ovitraps was {{to monitor the}} spread and density of Aedes and other container-breeding mosquito populations by collecting eggs which could be counted, or hatched to identify the types of insects. Since its conception, researchers found that adding lethal substances to the ovitraps could control the populations of these targeted species. These traps are called lethal ovitraps. They primarily target Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are the main vectors of dengue fever, Zika virus, <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> virus, yellow fever, and chikungunya.|$|R

40|$|The {{mosquito}} Culex quinquefasciatus is a ubiquitous {{species that}} serves as a major vector for <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> virus and lymphatic filariasis. Ingestion of bloodmeal by females triggers a series of physiological processes in the midgut and also exposes them to infection by these pathogens. The bacteria normally harbored in the midgut are known to influence physiology and can also alter the response to various pathogens. The midgut bacteria in female Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected over a large geographical area from India was studied. Examination of 16 S ribosomal DNA amplicons from culturable microflora revealed the presence of 83 bacterial species belonging to 31 bacterial genera. All of these species belong to three phyla i. e. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum (37 species), followed by Firmicutes (33 species) and Actinobacteria (13 species). Phylum Proteobacteria, was dominated by members of γ-proteobacteria class. The genus Staphylococcus was the largest genus represented by 11 species whereas Enterobacter was the most prevalent genus and recovered from all the field stations except Leh. Highest bacterial prevalence was observed from Bhuj (22 species) followed by Nagrota (18 species), Masimpur (18 species) and Hathigarh (16 species). Whereas, least species were observed from Leh (8 species). It has been observed that individual mosquito harbor extremely diverse gut bacteria and have very small overlap bacterial taxa in their gut. This variation in midgut microbiota {{may be one of the}} factors responsible for variation in disease transmission rates or vector competence within mosquito population. The present data strongly encourage further investigations to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria in mosquito for the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> virus. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on midgut microbiota of wild Cx. quinquefasciatus from over a large geographical area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Several {{populations of}} Culex pipiens sensu latu mosquitoes, a vector of mosquito-born flaviviruses such as <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> virus, have {{developed}} resistance to pyrethroids in the United States. To design and then institute resistance monitoring, mitigation, and management strategies, {{knowledge of the}} mechanisms of resistance will be required. Preliminary investigations conducted on Culex pipiens s. l. populations in California and Southern Africa strongly suggest that this resistance is mediated by enzymatic detoxification and/or target-site sensitivity. The aims are to determine permethrin resistance levels in first generation progeny of colonies-collected Culex spp. from various regions of California and evaluate the levels of detoxification enzyme [esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) ] and improve diagnostic Knockdown resistance (kdr) in F 1 progeny of Culex spp. mosquitoes with confirmed permethrin resistance. In this study, mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex were collected at various sites throughout California and tested for esterase, GST, and kdr activities. The esterase, GST, and kdr activities were compared to the corresponding activities found in a pyrethroid-sensitive laboratory strain Culex quinquefasciatus (CQ 1). A correlation was found between elevated esterases activities and kdr assay indicating that further investigation {{should be done to}} figure out the potential role of enzyme detoxification and kdr assay in conceding resistance to pyrethroids class.
