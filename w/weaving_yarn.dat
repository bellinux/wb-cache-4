Sit thee down there and wait until such time as we may have come into the city, and reached the house of my father. But when thou deemest that we are got to the palace, then go up to the city of the Phaeacians, and ask for the house of my father, Alcinous, high of heart. It is easily known, and a young child could be thy guide, for nowise like it are builded the houses of the Phaeacians, so goodly is the palace of the hero Alcinous. But when thou art within the shadow of the halls and the court, pass quickly through the great chamber till thou comest to my mother, who sits at the hearth {{in the light of the}} fire, <b>weaving</b> <b>yarn</b> of sea-purple stain, a wonder to behold. Her chair is leaned against a pillar, and her maidens sit behind her. And there my father's throne leans close to hers, wherein he sits and drinks his wine, like an immortal. Pass thou by him, and cast thy hands about my mother's knees that thou mayest see quickly and with joy the day of thy returning, even if thou art from a very far country. If but her heart be kindly disposed towards thee, then is there hope that thou shalt see thy friends, and come to thy well-builded house, and to thine own country.' ...|$|E

50|$|Gowdie and {{her husband}} lived {{in the area around}} Loch Loy, some two miles to the north of Auldearn. During the 17th-century the sea loch was larger than it is now and was {{surrounded}} by woodland, hills and sand dunes. Gowdie's husband was a farm labourer, possibly a cottar, hired by one of the tenants of the Laird of Park; in return for his labour he would have been provided with a cottage and the use of a small parcel of land. According to Wilby, their lifestyle and social status could be compared with present day developing countries. Unable to read or write, Gowdie possessed a good imagination and the ability to express herself eloquently. Her daily life was spent undertaking basic household chores and tasks such as milking, making bread, <b>weaving</b> <b>yarn</b> or weeding.|$|E

40|$|Unconventional {{textiles}} are goods {{obtained by}} methods {{other than the}} classic spinning, weaving and knitting. They are manufactured by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a fabric consisting of fiber layers {{or a combination of}} fiber, <b>weaving,</b> <b>yarn</b> or textile layers. Also, unconventional textiles can be obtained by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a yarn pattern or multiple yarn patterns. The tendency of the industry to increase production of synthetic fibers în comparison to natural fibers is also visible în the field of unconventional textiles. Additionally, there is more and more emphasis on using fibers recovered from recycled materials and products which resulted from a classic textile manufacturing process. A TUFTING product is made from a backing fabric, usually cloth, reinforced with yarn introduced through the fabric in loops spaced equally relative to the stitches, and raised at the ends. The fur substitutes can also be obtained with unconventional TUFTING technologies, by reinforcing a backing cloth and then undergoing a final reinforcement by raising and felting on one side. The TUFTING product obtained by reinforcing and weaving can be used în the manufacturing process because it is predisposed to unraveling and has an inadequate aspect. For an optimal uniformity în Tufting fur substitutes, it is recommended that the backing cloth has a mean apparent density of 300 Kg/m 3 with a 5...|$|E

40|$|<b>Weave,</b> <b>yarn</b> density, yarn count, fiber {{material}} {{and so on}} of woven fabrics greatly affect their surface characteristics. Surface characteristics of a fabric are important factor for consumers and textile producers in order to evaluate its fabric hand. However, there is no simple system to easily measure its surface characteristics. This study uses a simple tactile sensor that can measure the friction coefficients of fabric surfaces and tries to evaluate their surface characteristics from obtained values. We traced surfaces of plural fabrics that differ in <b>yarn,</b> <b>weave</b> and <b>yarn</b> density with the tactile sensor, and measured variation of the friction coefficients {{with respect to the}} trace distance. This study introduces some evaluation values from the measured variation of the friction coefficients and compares them with results by KES, which is the ordinary system to evaluate surface characteristics of a fabric. As a result, the study confirmed that proposed method easily evaluates the geometrical and frictional properties of woven fabrics as their fabric hand, and also can estimate the <b>yarn</b> density of <b>woven</b> fabric by analyzing the oscillation period of variation of friction coefficient...|$|R

5000|$|Weaving in, or [...] "inlay", is {{a related}} but {{different}} technique {{that is used}} to thread an extra yarn(s) into the fabric without knitting it. The <b>woven</b> <b>yarn(s)</b> need not be the same thickness or color as the knitted yarn, and almost always (but not necessarily) follow the horizontal rows (courses) of knitting. Because the extra yarn simply passes {{back and forth between the}} knitted stitches, it can be pulled out unless it is secured in some way at the sides. The resulting fabric is more like a woven texture than a knit because the extra strand reduces its elasticity.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{various kinds}} of woven composites, its {{applications}} and fabricating methods have been reviewed. Few investigations have only been performed on anti-plane loaded woven composites. In most of them the solutions have been limited to finite element analysis, so, less pure theoretical works have been done until now. In final part of this study, an analytical model has been presented to investigate the behavior of woven fabric composites under anti-plane loading (bending), so {{that each of the}} <b>woven</b> <b>yarns</b> has been simulated to an elastic straight beam which has a concentrated load on one of the intersections of the yarns. In the analysis consider that the resin has bonded each of the yarn pairs rigidly and so the deflection of the resin is almost zero. The supports are also rigid and simply supported. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory has been considered here and slipping and shear effects haven’t been regarded here...|$|R

The paper also assesses {{the influence of}} weaving damage to load-bearing glass yarns on the tensile properties of 3 D orthogonal woven composites. It is found that damage occurs to yarns at most stages of the 3 D weaving process due to abrasion and breakage caused when sliding against the loom machinery, The abrasion damage causes a large reduction (similar to 30 %) to the tensile strength of the dry <b>woven</b> <b>yarns,</b> although the tensile stiffness remains unaffected. The damage and reduction to the tensile properties of the dry <b>yarns</b> at different <b>weaving</b> stages are described.

40|$|Woven cloth can {{commonly}} be seen {{in daily}} life and also in animation. Unless prevented in some way, woven cloth usually frays at the edges. However, in computer graphics, woven cloth is typically modeled as a continuum sheet, which is not suitable for representing frays. This paper proposes a model that allows yarn movement and slippage during cloth tearing. Drawing upon techniques from textile and mechanical engineering fields, we model cloth as <b>woven</b> <b>yarn</b> crossings where each yarn can be independently torn when the strain limit is reached. To make the model practical for graphics applications, we simulate only tearing part of cloth with a yarn-level model using a simple constrained mass-spring system for computational efficiency. We designed conditions for switching from a standard continuum sheet model to our yarn-level model, so that frays can be initiated and propagated along the torn lines. Results show that our method can achieve plausible tearing cloth animation with frayed edges.
