5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories. This is <b>why</b> <b>most</b> prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain <b>why</b> <b>most</b> plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is <b>why</b> <b>most</b> famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E

5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains <b>why</b> <b>most</b> of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} helminths in the sanitation field are the human parasites, which is <b>why</b> <b>most</b> people relate the term helminth to them, {{where they are}} classified as nemathelminthes (nematodes) and platyhelminthes, depending on whether they possess a round or flat-shaped body respectively.

25|$|Copper {{building}} wire {{is compatible}} with brass and quality plated screws. The wire provides connections that will not corrode or creep. It is not, however, compatible with aluminium wire or connectors. If the two metals are joined, a galvanic reaction can occur. Anodic corrosion during the reaction can disintegrate the aluminium. This is <b>why</b> <b>most</b> appliance and electrical equipment manufacturers use copper lead wires for connections to building wiring systems.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} reliability {{problem is}} caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it.

25|$|Two seam bowlers {{are usually}} {{expected}} to bowl in tandem {{for the first}} 10 or so overs, after which time the ball may begin to swing and {{one or both of}} them is substituted for a swing bowler or a spin bowler. This is <b>why</b> <b>most</b> sides opt to include at least two seam bowlers who are known as opening bowlers. Seam bowling usually becomes very ineffective with older balls and is virtually useless after 60 overs or so and as a result the bowling places in the side are filled with swing or spin bowlers.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of these aromas is very {{dependent on the}} amount of anthocyanins and other phenolics that protect these compounds from oxidation. One of the reasons why rosés have such a very limited shelf-life is because of their low phenolic levels due to the very limited skin contact and extraction time. Usually within a year of production the levels of 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol in the wine have dropped to half its fermentation levels with the presence of 3-mercaptohenyl acetate undetectable in most wines. This is <b>why</b> <b>most</b> wine experts recommend that rosés are consumed as soon after release as possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of sexual reproduction {{as well as}} its maintenance, is another mystery in biology. The purpose of sexual reproduction is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (ﬁtness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction. Mating types (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of anisogamy (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy. It is also unknown <b>why</b> <b>most</b> sexual organisms use a binary mating system, and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. Charles Darwin was the first to suggest that sexual selection drives speciation (the formation of species); without sexual reproduction it is unlikely that complex life would have evolved.|$|E

25|$|Balarama is {{an ancient}} deity, a {{prominent}} one by the epics era of Indian history as evidenced by archeological and numismatic evidence. His iconography appears with Nāga (many-headed serpent), a plough and other farm artifacts such as watering pot, possibly indicating his origins in a bucolic, agricultural culture. Balarama's legend appears in many Parva (books) of the Mahabharata. The Book Three (Vana Parva) states Krishna and him to be brothers born to separate mothers, but one father. Book One (Adi Parva) states the circumstances that lead to light skinned Balarama, and dark skinned Krishna. Book Thirteen (Anushasana Parva) presents the mythology of Sesha's incarnation into Balarama, as Vishnu incarnated as Krishna, likely reflecting the basis <b>why</b> <b>most</b> of ancient and early medieval artworks of Balarama show a snake hood {{on top of his}} head.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{also showed}} that the unique {{characteristics}} of the Yogo sapphires are related to their geological history. Most sapphires are formed under low pressure and temperature over geologically short periods of time, and this is <b>why</b> <b>most</b> non-Yogo sapphires have imperfections and inconsistent coloring. Yogos show crystalline formation under very high temperatures and pressures corresponding to a great depth, over geologically long periods of time. [...] Brown {{also showed that}} distribution of gem rough through the dike was not consistent, so using an average [...] "ounces per ton" [...] was misleading.

[...] In his 2013 movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a four-star rating, calling it a [...] "staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-seller," [...] saying [...] "this looks and feels like nothing Hollywood has ever made before". He also described it as [...] "Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date". James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a [...] "major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust." [...] In his review for the New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized [...] "were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement." [...] Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the [...] "visual brilliance" [...] of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. He describes the sequence as [...] "realistic" [...] and [...] "stunning". He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.
