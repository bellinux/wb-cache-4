30|$|<b>MPI,</b> which <b>is</b> the {{standard}} software communication paradigm {{used in this}} network, has been in use {{for several years and}} is well-established and thoroughly debugged. One of the main features of MPI includes the state preserving process i.e., processes can live as long as the system runs and {{there is no need to}} read the same data again and again as in the case of other frameworks such as MapReduce (explained in section “Apache hadoop”). All the parameters can be preserved locally. Hence, unlike MapReduce, <b>MPI</b> <b>is</b> well suited for iterative processing [5]. Another feature of <b>MPI</b> <b>is</b> the hierarchical master/slave paradigm. When <b>MPI</b> <b>is</b> deployed in the master–slave model, the slave machine can become the master for other processes. This can be extremely useful for dynamic resource allocation where the slaves have large amounts of data to process.|$|R

40|$|SummaryDiffuse systemic-pulmonary anastomoses {{and chronic}} {{hypoxemia}} {{may result in}} increase in ventricular work in bronchiectasis. We aimed to assess right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) functions in patients with bronchiectasis by using tissue Doppler-derived myocardial performance index (<b>MPI),</b> which <b>is</b> a novel and more sensitive parameter than conventional ventricular function parameters. To assess the possibility of RV and LV dysfunctions occurring in bronchiectasis, we studied 25 patients with bronchiectasis, and compared them with 22 age- and gender-matched control subjects. <b>MPI,</b> which <b>is</b> a combined index of both systolic and diastolic ventricular function, was calculated for both ventricles. RV and LV <b>MPIs</b> <b>were</b> also significantly different in patients and the controls. RV <b>MPI</b> <b>was</b> associated {{with the number of}} involved lobe, arterial blood oxygen pressure, and acceleration time/ejection time of pulmonary flow. LV <b>MPI</b> <b>was</b> not related to any clinical parameter, but it was correlated only with RV <b>MPI.</b> Ventricular functions <b>are</b> impaired in bronchiectasis.
