"Roland" [...] {{contains}} the series' first mention of Fox Mulder's father Bill, although the character would not actually {{make an appearance}} until the second season episode [...] "Colony". In the original draft of the script for [...] "Roland", however, Mulder's mention of his father was instead meant to be his sister, Samantha. The scene depicting {{the aftermath of the}} Dr. Keats' murder—with the scattered pieces of his shattered frozen body marked off with multiple chalk outlines—has been described as [...] "truly inspired". Chris Carter noted that [...] "any shock and horror was eliminated by the laugh you got <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> those little pieces on the floor", also commenting that the actual murder takes place off-screen, and is only heard.|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.' I always thought that was a nice way to say, 'Once more.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the style of hanging-back defensive play common in the later 1950s and 1960s, Orr {{was known for his}} fluid skating and end-to-end rushing. Orr's rushing enabled him to be where the puck was, allowing him not only to score effectively but also to defend when necessary. According to the Bruins' Phil Esposito, [...] "No matter how fast an opponent was, Bobby could skate faster than him if he needed {{to do it in the}} framework of a play. If he was caught up-ice and the other team had an odd-man rush, that's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> his truly great speed. Very seldom did he not get back to have a hand in breaking up the play." [...] Orr also benefited from playing most of his career in Boston Garden, which was [...] shorter than the standard NHL rink. This suited his rushing style very well, as he was able to get from one end of the ice to the other faster than in a standard rink.|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{continued}} throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater {{demands on}} Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless {{he does so}} himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would {{find out about the}} affair; [...] "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?" [...] In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, [...] "an act of betrayal on a massive scale." [...] Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this [...] "iconic" [...] scene: [...] "It {{was one of the few}} times <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> Pauline really, really let rip... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did." [...] This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in [...] and is described by Wendy Richard as [...] "Pauline's crowning moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, DC Comics {{acquired}} {{a line of}} characters from Charlton Comics. During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, {{as he had done}} in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbour. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them [...] "so it would have the shock and surprise value <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> what the reality of these characters was". Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker, and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. Moore said, [...] "DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional." [...] Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers, but later changed his mind. He said, [...] "Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elvis Presley saw Harris {{perform in}} Memphis {{in the early}} 1950s.

Harris remarked in a 1956 interview that Elvis's hip movements were stirring controversy in a way his own never did: [...] "Many people have been giving him trouble for swinging his hips. I swing mine and have no trouble. He's got publicity I could not buy".|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, Hay was {{described}} as being a very serious and private man, some thought he may have a dark side due to his demeanour. Peter Ustinov, who made his film debut in The Goose Steps Out as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him [...] "Well, Will Hay wasn't very funny but I found that very few comics are." [...] as well as [...] "And Will Hay was always {{wrapped in a blanket}} at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, and then we went on shooting. I don't remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange." ...|$|E
