(Hornblower was {{an inspiration to}} Roddenberry and Shatner when making the show, although Meyer was unaware of this.) Sallin was impressed with Meyer's vision for the film: [...] "His ideas brought dimension that broadened {{the scope of the}} material as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> it."

Reviews were strong, and the film {{is considered one of}} the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was [...] "the most professional actor I've ever known. He was always 'real'. I simply forgot we were making a picture. His eyes would actually fill up when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a tender scene. And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Grimes regains {{consciousness}} and investigates his situation {{is reminiscent of the}} British horror films The Day of the Triffids (1962) and 28 Days Later (2002). Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. So <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> our second issue by the time I saw it. It {{was going to be a}} matter of somehow trying to restage the entire first issue, because it was a very similar coma opening.

Series {{background}} designer Kenny Pittenger said that [...] "the only real difference between the way we draw now {{and the way we}} drew then is that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season." [...] The crew began the shift while they were working on the episode. Pittenger said that [...] "it was while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> 'Pest of the West', one of the half-hour specials, that we made the switch… did you notice?" [...] The shift to Wacom Cintiqs let the designers and animators draw on the computer screen and make immediate changes or undo mistakes. Pittenger said [...] "Many neo-Luddites—er… I mean, many of my cohorts—don't like working on them, but I find them useful. There's no substitute for the immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital nautical nonsense is still pretty fun." ...|$|E

I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have {{felt the need to}} slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their more}} visible Discovery years, Daft Punk {{appeared}} wearing robotic headgear and metallic gloves for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. The helmets were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors Alex and Martin, the duo who also designed them. With engineering by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., {{they are capable}} of various LED effects. Wigs were originally attached to both helmets, but the duo removed them just before the outfits were publicly unveiled in 2001. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers in an advertisement during a special presentation of the music videos from the Discovery album during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Bangalter once stated, [...] "We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> our sampler, and at exactly 9:09am on September 9, 1999, it exploded.

500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on,</b> The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy thing out there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E

500|$|The {{animation}} of {{the eagle}} (the [...] "Eagle King") that transports Kuros to the Wind Elemental {{was one of}} Ste Pickford's first graphics which he drew for the NES. It was done in Deluxe Paint for the Amiga with sketching done by mouse - without assistance from graphics tablets or other scanners. He took eagle drawings from a book on animals in motion by Eadweard Muybridge. Pickford wanted {{to show off the}} possible graphical capabilities of the NES; he said, [...] "I wanted to do something 'flashy' early in the game, trying to show off my amazing graphic art skills on the rather primitive NES. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> Amiga and ST games at the same time, so were always trying to push the NES with bigger and better graphics, right from the start of our work on the machine." [...] The eagle consisted of only three colors and between 11 and 17 sprites per frame of animation. There was a smaller version of the same eagle, which was used as a regular enemy in that level.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{follow-up}} single, [...] "Get Me to the World on Time", {{which put}} distorted sound effects to a psychedelic-tinged Bo Diddley beat, {{was released in}} May 1967. The song managed to chart at number 27 in the US and number 42 in the UK, and was the most electronically experimental composition by the group thus far. When {{it came time for}} The Electric Prunes to record songs for their first album, they were limited musically due to the predominate presence of Tucker and Mantz's (also Jill Jones) songwriting partnership, which composed the majority of the album's material. The group's debut album, The Electric Prunes possessed exotically-combined effects, and violin-like guitar riffs, mixed with a diverse, and somewhat uneven, selection of pop songs, with only [...] "Train For Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Luvin'" [...] being penned by the band. Tracks such as the soft rock tune, [...] "Onie" [...] and [...] "Toonerville Trolley" [...] suggest inconsistency in an attempt to produce a commercially viable sound. Reflecting on the album, Tulin said, [...] "Consequently there are definitely songs that I believe do not belong on the album and were, in fact, a waste of our time and energy. There were several other ideas <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on,</b> but [...] realized there was no use pursuing them because they too would have been 'too weird.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States.

[...] "And when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> the America project I {{spent a lot of}} time on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future."

[...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him.

500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. While most episodes consisted of two shorts that were about eleven minutes long or specials that lasted the whole episode, certain episodes were made of one full eleven-minute episode, and two shorts, one of which was seven minutes long and the other only four minutes long. The animation was handled overseas in South Korea at Rough Draft Studios. Throughout the series run, from 1999 to 2008, SpongeBob SquarePants was drawn and animated using pencils.

It was wide open. To close it and to have the pump started that would empty it were the work of but a minute; but we had had a close call.|$|E
