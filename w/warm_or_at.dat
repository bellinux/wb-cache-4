60|$|Perhaps {{it would}} be better to come to York {{somewhat}} earlier in the year than the 2d of September. By that time the English summer has suffered often if not severe discouragements. It has really only two months out of the year to itself, and even July and August are not always constant to it. To be sure, their defection cannot spoil it, but they dispose it to the slights of September in a dejection from which there is no rise to those coquetries with October known to our own summer. Yet, having said so much, I feel bound to add that our nine days in York, from the 2d to the 12th of September, were more summer than autumn days, some wholly, some partly, with hours of sunshine keeping the flowers bright which the rain kept fresh. If you walked fast in this sunshine you were quite hot, and sometimes in the rain you were uncomfortably <b>warm,</b> <b>or</b> <b>at</b> least you were wet. If the mornings demanded a fire in the grate, the evenings were so clement that the lamp was sufficient, and the noons were very well with neither.|$|E

The serving method and containers are similar to those used for sake and soju, though baijiu differs significantly. Baijiu is generally sold in glass or ceramic bottles and consumed in shot glasses, much like vodka. It is traditional to drink baijiu with food rather than on its own, though the latter is not uncommon.|$|E
50|$|The {{artichokes}} are cleaned {{with a sharp}} knife, eliminating all {{the hard}} leaves and the thorns with an upward spiral movement. Only a couple of cm of the stem are left: the rest is cleaned, cut in pieces and cooked with the artichokes. The artichokes are plunged for some minutes in water with lemon juice, so that they won't turn brown. Then they are opened {{in the center and}} the choke (present only towards season's end) is removed. In the resulting cavity of each artichoke, is stuffed a mixture of parsley, lesser calamint (in Rome named mentuccia), garlic, salt and pepper. At the end, all the artichokes are put in a deep pan, standing on the stem, enough in number so that they support each other and don't fall. Water and white wine are added, and oil, pepper and salt are sprinkled on them. Then are braised in the covered pan until the liquid has evaporated. One can eat them <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> <b>at</b> room temperature.|$|E
50|$|Clearly, the {{temperature}} gradient may change substantially in time, {{as a result}} of diurnal or seasonal heating and cooling for instance. This most likely happens during an inversion. For instance, during the day {{the temperature}} at ground level may be cold while it's warmer up in the atmosphere. As the day shifts over to night the temperature might drop rapidly while at other places on the land stay <b>warmer</b> <b>or</b> cooler <b>at</b> the same elevation. This happens on the West Coast of the United States sometimes due to geography.|$|R

In some regions, instead of bánh chưng, people make bánh tét which is a cylindrical cake with almost the same ingredients as bánh chưng. A similar cake as bánh tét is made in some regions in the North but with the name bánh tày or bánh chưng dài (long bánh chưng). Bánh tày is often made with small quantity of mung bean and little or no pork {{so that it can}} be preserved for a longer period, bánh tày can be cut in slices and fried like bánh chưng rán.

5000|$|Another {{agent is}} the buoyant {{convective}} upward motion caused by significant daytime solar heating <b>at</b> surface level, <b>or</b> by relatively high absolute humidity. [...] Incoming short-wave radiation {{generated by the}} sun is re-emitted as long-wave radiation when it reaches Earth's surface. This process warms the air closest to ground and increases air mass instability by creating a steeper temperature gradient from <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> hot <b>at</b> surface level to cold aloft. This causes it to rise and cool until temperature equilibrium is achieved with the surrounding air aloft. Moderate instability allows {{for the formation of}} cumuliform clouds of moderate size that can produce light showers if the airmass is sufficiently moist. Typical convection upcurrents may allow the droplets to grow to a radius of about 0.015 mm before precipitating as showers. The equivalent diameter of these droplets is about 0.03 mm.|$|R

60|$|But here it {{was that}} a bitter quarrel began between the {{brothers}} that might have ended in {{not one of them}} ever seeing Tishnar's Valleys alive. It was like this: Not knowing in which direction to be going in order to seek for a path or pass whereby to scale Arakkaboa, they were at a loss what to be doing. Even the Munza-mulgars detest being more than the height of the loftiest forest-tree above their shadows on the ground; more especially, therefore, did these Mulla-mulgars, who never, or very rarely, as I have said many times already, climb trees at all. So they determined to stay awhile here and rest and eat until some Mulgar should come along of whom they could ask the way. It was a valley rich with the sweet ground-fruit I have already mentioned, whose spikes of a faint and thorny blue mount just above the snow, and whose berries, owing to their sugary coats or pods, resist all coldness. So that, without mention of Ukka-nuts, of which a grove grew not far beyond the bend of the valley, the travellers had plenty to eat. They had also an abundance of water, because of a little torrent that came roaring through its ice near by the trees they had chosen for their lodging. The wind that softly blew along this low land was <b>warmer,</b> <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> least, not so keen and fitful as the forest wind, and they were by now growing accustomed to the cold. For the night, however, they raised up for themselves a kind of leaning shelter, or huddle, of branches to be moved against the wind according as it blew up or down the valley.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm for disaggregating daily rainfall into sub-daily rainfall ‘fragments’ (continuous fine-resolution rainfall sequences whose total depth sums {{to the daily}} rainfall amount) under a future, warmer climate. The basis of the algorithm is to re-sample sub-daily fragments from the historical record conditional on the total daily rainfall amount {{and a range of}} temperature-based atmospheric predictors representative of the future climate. The logic is that as the atmosphere warms, future rainfall patterns will be more reflective of historical rainfall patterns which occurred on warmer days at the same location, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> locations which have an atmospheric temperature profile more reflective of expected future conditions. It was found that the daily to sub-daily scaling relationship varied significantly by season and by location, with rainfall patterns on <b>warmer</b> seasons <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>warmer</b> locations typically showing more intense rainfall occurring over shorter periods within a day compared with cooler seasons and locations. Importantly, by regressing against temperature-based atmospheric covariates, this effect was substantially reduced, suggesting that the approach may also be valid when extrapolating to a future climate. An adjusted method of fragments algorithm was then applied to nine stations around Australia, with the results showing that when holding total daily rainfall constant, th...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} {{that the rate of}} warming is amplified with elevation, such that high-mountain environments experience more rapid changes in temperature than environments at lower elevations. Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) can accelerate the rate of change in mountain ecosystems, cryospheric systems, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Here we review important mechanisms that contribute towards EDW: snow albedo and surface-based feedbacks; water vapour changes and latent heat release; surface water vapour and radiative flux changes; surface heat loss and temperature change; and aerosols. All lead to enhanced <b>warming</b> with elevation (<b>or</b> <b>at</b> a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW. We discuss future needs to increase knowledge of mountain temperature trends and their controlling mechanisms through improved observations, satellite-based remote sensing and model simulations...|$|R

40|$|Squamates often {{follow an}} inverse Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 s rule, with larger-bodied animals {{occurring}} in <b>warmer</b> areas <b>or</b> <b>at</b> lower latitudes. The size of dorsal scales in lizards {{has also been}} proposed to vary along climatic gradients, with species in warmer areas exhibiting larger scales, putatively to reduce heat load. We tested for these patterns in the diverse and widespread lizard genus Sceloporus. Among 106 species or populations, body size was associated positively with maximum temperature (consistent with the inverse of Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 s rule) and aridity, but did not covary with latitude. Scale size (inferred from the inverse relation with numbers of scales) {{was positively related to}} body size. Controlling for body size via multiple regression, scale size was associated negatively with latitude (best predictor), positively with minimum temperature, and negatively with aridity (similar results were obtained using scores from a principal components analysis of latitude and climatic indicators). Thus, lizards with larger scales are not necessarily found in areas with higher temperatures. Univariate analyses indicated phylogenetic signal for body size, scale counts, latitude, and all climate indicators. In all cases, phylogenetic regression models fit the data significantly better than nonphylogenetic models; thus, residuals for log 10 number of dorsal scale rows exhibited phylogenetic signal...|$|R
