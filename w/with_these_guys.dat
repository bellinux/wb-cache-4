I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

Stateman {{recorded}} on-location sound during filming, placing microphones on the actors' backpacks and clothing [...] "so [...] would hear explosions and bullets going by as though [...] were <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> as they were being attacked." [...] In creating sound effects for the environment of each scene, Stateman relied on foley design, rather than traditional sound effects.|$|E
500|$|Bostaph {{eventually}} {{left the}} band before Christmas {{due to a}} chronic elbow injury, saying it would hinder his ability to play. After his departure, Bostaph joined the band Systematic. On December 21, 2001, {{it was announced that}} the original drummer, Dave Lombardo, would [...] "temporarily reclaim his place behind the drums on the next leg" [...] of Slayer's God Hates Us All tour. Bostaph described his time with the band as [...] "an unbelievable ride with Slayer, playing <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> has been an incredible high point in my career", and that he is [...] "really grateful for the experience".|$|E

500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2012, Hart {{embarked}} on a short tour of Ireland with a new lineup, Colm O' Herlihy on guitar, Dan Walsh on drums and Simon Dargan on bass In a recent Facebook Q, Hart commented [...] "I love playing <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> They let me make music rather than getting bogged down administrating a band's business. They make it a joy with their self-starting ways" [...] He confirmed this lineup for his upcoming European and USA dates. Most recently, Hart released the double album The Argument (based on John Milton's Paradise Lost) {{in the summer of}} 2013.|$|E

5000|$|Of the {{creative}} process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained [...] "We {{were interested in the}} psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don’t quite understand what’s up, but you start to get signs. For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, maybe a little bit too much love here and there. But, for me, there’s something wrong <b>with</b> both of <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> Deeply. This concept of, 'who is the creep in this scenario?'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Lanegan told Christina Fuoco of Live Daily [...] "My {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} satisfying that I've had". [...] "It's great to play with, essentially, my best friends." [...] When he was asked about the difference between Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age he said [...] "It's all rock 'n' roll to me. A band is a band. They're really not that radically different. It's all rock music." [...] Lanegan has continued to work with Queens of the Stone Age even after leaving the band. In 2007, he appeared on their album, Era Vulgaris, contributing background vocals to the track [...] "River in the Road".|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, {{post-traumatic}} growth, positive psychological change {{experienced as}} a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances could also result. The triumph of the miners in a highly challenging environment could also increase their self-confidence and strengthen bonds with each other and with their families. [...] "When people are deprived ... it can be really adverse, it can really mess up a person. <b>With</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> they were together", said Charles Nelson, a psychologist with the operational stress injury clinic at Parkwood Hospital in London, Ontario. Peter Suedfeld, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia, said the men are less likely to have trouble returning to their jobs. [...] "Sailors who have been shipwrecked, for example ... many of them go back to sea", he said. [...] "They'll feel that they can cope with anything that comes up." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Tracii Guns {{owning the}} rights to the name (along with Steve Riley), he changed the name of The Tracii Guns Band to L.A. Guns in the summer of 2006, {{creating}} a conflict, as there were now two groups touring under the [...] "L.A. Guns" [...] moniker. In October of the same year, during the 20-year anniversary party for Cathouse Club, in Hollywood, Phil Lewis joined Tracii Guns' L.A. Guns onstage, after being invited by singer Paul Black, for a duet of [...] "Rip and Tear." [...] Despite Black's hopes that this would [...] "relieve the tension between the two line-ups", Lewis would later state that [...] "Tracii [...] as good as he is, has had to pretty much lower himself to playing <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> that {{if they were going to}} do anything they would have done it in the past twenty years, but they have done nothing." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{amalgamation}} of {{the unions}} {{was not without}} some difficulty. Horace Tapscott, who was a 15-year-old member of the union {{at the time and}} remembered Douglass as among the [...] "vanguard of the movement," [...] indicated in his 2001 autobiography that after the amalgamation, the union was separated by cliques, where a [...] "particular, small, black group of guys would work all the time, because they were in that particular clique <b>with</b> <b>these</b> particular <b>guys</b> who ran the studios." [...] Though he said that the work seemed to get better [...] "for certain people", he also said that many of the older musicians [...] "didn't have anyplace to go" [...] after the closing of the black union.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s he pioneered {{the concept of}} the in-room {{swimming}} pool. Wilkins later {{came up with the idea}} of a champagne glass bathtub, which debuted in 1983. It was a 7-foot-high Plexiglas whirlpool bath shaped like a long-stemmed champagne glass, large enough to accommodate two adults. [...] Wilkins said, [...] "I went to a Caesars board meeting and there I was, sitting around the table <b>with</b> <b>these</b> high-powered <b>guys</b> from Las Vegas. I pulled out a picture of a champagne glass and they looked at me like I was nuts." [...] He said that it cost about $150,000 to design and make the molds for the champagne glass tubs. Speck Plastics in Wind Gap, Pennsylvania, manufactured the tubs for about $15,000 each.|$|R
5000|$|Rendella tharuvatha [...] is {{the story}} of three young men who follow their hearts. They always believe in the {{ideology}} that life could be adventurous in creating new paths rather than walking in the good old beaten path. These three choose the creative field as it could fill their creative thirst. In certain situation, they meet Malathi. Malathi falls in love with Kittu in the process. Looking at the creative dimension in <b>these</b> three <b>guys,</b> she introduces them to Gandam, who runs creative agency. Gandam is quite ebullient person and likes the creative approach in these three boys. Gandam already gathered many rivalries in the market because of the tough competition he gives to others. <b>With</b> <b>these</b> three <b>guys</b> joining the company it becomes highly impossible for others to sustain in the market. With company's rapid growth and success they all decide to party in an abandoned place far from city. All of them get fully drunk and slowly move into a nearby cemetery. Vamshi who is also a photographer plans a prank to fool Gandam. They all go into sleep only to find that Gandam is missing. The practical joke played by three guys misfires and they become the prime suspects behind the Gandam's missing case. How <b>these</b> three <b>guys</b> prove their innocence makes the rest of the story.|$|R

The band later performed in Japan with Between the Buried and Me. Drummer Michael Justian rejoined the band in February 2010, shortly after Fickeisen departed. Fickeisen commented his departure: [...] "There is no easy way to go about leaving a busy band with plans in constant motion, but a little abruptly, I chose to depart from manning the kit for The Red Chord. I have had a great time {{for the past five years}} <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> and wouldn't exchange it for anything. Touring is tough; everyone who's done it knows that. (...)

[...] Rosenqvist believed in the short-term he would look back at the whole race weekend positively for himself and Mahindra but was [...] "disappointed" [...] about his second-place result: [...] "Today, we were under pressure from Sébastien, we knew that we would be close as they looked very strong compared to yesterday. I knew that I had to drive a perfect race, every corner we had to drive perfect. I think we did a great job." [...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which meant we could keep up a little bit <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> but we need to improve.

5000|$|Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had {{approached}} SpongeBob SquarePants creator Stephen Hillenburg {{for a film}} based on the show as early as 2001, but he refused {{for more than a}} year. He was concerned, after watching The Iron Giant and Toy Story with his sons, about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically-consequential and inspiring without losing what he calls the SpongeBob [...] "cadence." [...] He said, on a break from season four post-production, [...] "To do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, I think ... This had to be SpongeBob in a great adventure. That's where the comedy's coming from, having these two naïve characters, SpongeBob and Patrick, a doofus and an idiot, on this incredibly dangerous heroic odyssey with all the odds against them." [...] The writers decided to write a mythical hero's quest for the 2004 film: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. Of the plot, Bill Fagerbakke (the voice of Patrick) said, [...] "It's just nuts. I'm continually dazzled and delighted <b>with</b> what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> came up with." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to release, {{the track}} was played during Mobys Area:One summer festival in 2001. It was {{announced}} as Morning Views lead single in June that year. Guitarist Mike Einziger noted that [...] "Wish You Were Here" [...] {{was one of}} the last songs written for Morning View and that [...] "the content is about being happy living for the moment and not looking forward to the future as some event." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd also elaborated on its meaning: [...] "The song wasnt specifically about a person. It was about me acknowledging a very brief moment in my life and in my experience <b>with</b> all of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> in making this record. In that moment, I wish that I had somebody to go, I love you, man. I was wishing that there was someone there to share that moment with." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg and the show's staff {{stopped making}} episodes {{to work on}} the film after the show's third season. The film's plot {{originally}} had SpongeBob rescue Patrick from a fisherman in Florida; an obvious reference to the 2003 film, Finding Nemo, this was later said by Tom Kenny (the voice of SpongeBob) to be a [...] "joke" [...] plot to keep fans busy. Hillenburg wrote the film with five other writer-animators from the show (Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne and Tim Hill) over a three-month period in a room of a former Glendale, California bank. Osborne said, [...] "It was hugely fun although it did get kind of gamy in there." [...] At the beginning of the series, Hillenburg screened a number of silent shorts (from Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton) and work by two modern comic actors: Jerry Lewis and Pee-wee Herman, both obvious inspirations for SpongeBob. For the film, the writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface.

5000|$|The song mixes various genres together. These include {{classical}} music, progressive rock, and dubstep. This mixture {{gained a}} mixed reaction from fans. However, despite the strong dubstep influences, the supposed electronic sound is produced through [...] "real instruments". According to the band: [...] "We {{went to see}} Skrillex in Camden around October. We went 'Fuck, it's so heavy', loved it. It was like a full metal gig, they had the circles of death, people were moshing, I hadn't seen a reaction like that to electronic music before. We took inspiration {{and came up with}} 'Unsustainable'. Some of that hard dubstep or brostep coming from America is capturing the imagination. The moshpit has moved from guitars and gone towards the laptop, so with that song we're trying {{to see if we can}} challenge the laptop. We created something that was dubsteppy but we wanted to see if we could do it with real instruments. We wanted to ask, 'Can rock bands compete <b>with</b> what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are doing?'" [...] It should also be noted that the song has four distinct parts: a classical music section (with a female speaking voice in the background), a dubstep breakdown, a progressive rock bridge (also containing the female voice), and another dubstep breakdown to finish the song.|$|R

5000|$|According to Winfrey, her {{emotional}} turmoil gradually {{led to a}} weight problem: [...] "The reason I gained so much weight {{in the first place}} and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much.
