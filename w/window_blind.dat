2500|$|On March 14, 2008, Oakland Cemetery {{sustained}} {{significant damage}} when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta. [...] The City Sexton, Sam Reed, estimated that 50 to 60 trees were toppled {{and many more}} significantly damaged. [...] Dozens of headstones and obelisks were also destroyed. [...] Additionally, debris from other damaged buildings was blown into the cemetery; a shredded <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> was “draped like a necklace” around one marker. [...] It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{series is}} similar to the third series opening sequence. [...] Only {{difference}} is that the photo of each character is changed, each block does not show different parts of each character when it transitions; instead it transitions in various styles, for example in an opening in a <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> style. Series five titles still remain similar; the photos are changed again and there are eleven rectangles instead of four. Nick is almost completely absent from the opening titles in series five except in episode six of series five titled [...] "My Will Be Done"; he was missing in some episodes from series four and a few from series three.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, BS1363 did {{not require}} the [...] and neutral pins to have {{insulating}} sleeves. Plugs made to the recent revisions of the standard have insulated sleeves to prevent finger contact with pins, and also to stop metal objects (for example, fallen <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> slats) from becoming live if lodged between the wall and a partly pulled out plug. [...] The length of the sleeves prevents any live contacts from being exposed while the plug is being inserted or removed. [...] An early method of sleeving the pins involving spring-loaded sleeves is described in the 1967 British Patent GB1067870. [...] The method actually adopted is described in the 1972 British Patent GB1292991. Plugs with such pins were available in the 1970s, a Southern Electricity/RoSPA safety pamphlet from 1978 encourages their use. [...] Sleeved pins became required by the standard in 1984.|$|E

50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the Seagram Building is the <b>window</b> <b>blinds.</b> As was common with International style architects, Mies wanted the building to have a uniform appearance. One aspect of a façade which Mies disliked was the disordered irregularity when <b>window</b> <b>blinds</b> are drawn. Inevitably, people using different <b>windows</b> will draw <b>blinds</b> to different heights, making the building appear disorganized. To reduce this disproportionate appearance, Mies specified <b>window</b> <b>blinds</b> which only operated in three positions - fully open, halfway open/closed, or fully closed.|$|R

He had been alarmed by the green flashes, he said, so much so that after watching for a time from behind his bedroom <b>window</b> <b>blind,</b> he had got up and hastily dressed and made his family get up also, so that they might be ready for the end. He made them put on their Sunday clothes. They all went out into the garden together, their minds divided between admiration at the gloriousness of the spectacle and a great and growing awe. They were Dissenters, and very religious people out of business hours, and it seemed to them in those last magnificent moments that, after all, science must be wrong and the fanatics right. With the green vapors came conviction, and they prepared to meet their God. [...] .|$|E

60|$|Mr. Kernan was a {{commercial}} traveller {{of the old}} school which believed in the dignity of its calling. He had never {{been seen in the}} city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of these two articles of clothing, he said, a man could always pass muster. He carried on the tradition of his Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose memory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry. Modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in Crowe Street, on the <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> of which was written the name of his firm with the address--London, E. C. On the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid. From these bowls Mr. Kernan tasted tea. He took a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate. Then he paused to judge.|$|E
60|$|It was in Paris, {{many years}} ago, that I fell by chance into this habit of early rising. My night--by reasons that I need not enter into--had been a troubled one. Tired {{of the hot}} bed that gave no sleep, I rose and dressed myself, crept down the {{creaking}} stairs, experiencing the sensations of a burglar new to his profession, unbolted the great door of the hotel, and passed out into an unknown, silent city, bathed in a mysterious soft light. Since then, this strange sweet city of the dawn has never ceased to call to me. It may be in London, in Paris again, in Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, that I have gone to sleep, but if perchance I wake before the returning tide of human life has dimmed its glories with the mists and vapours of the noisy day, I know that beyond my <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> the fairy city, as I saw it first so many years ago--this city that knows no tears, no sorrow, through which there creeps no evil thing; this city of quiet vistas, fading into hope; this city of far-off voices whispering peace; this city of the dawn that still is young--invites me to talk with it awhile before the waking hours drive it before them, and with a sigh it passes whence it came.|$|E
60|$|In such {{a village}} as my colored brother drove me {{through on the}} way to the beach it was of an {{absolute}} fitness; and I wish I could convey a due sense of the exquisite keeping of the place. Each white house was more or less closely belted in with a white fence, of panels or pickets; the grassy door-yards glowed with flowers, and often a climbing rose embowered the door-way with its bloom. Away backward or sidewise stretched the woodshed from the dwelling to the barn, and shut the whole under one cover; the turf grew to the wheel-tracks of the road-way, over which the elms rose and drooped; and from one end of the village to the other you could not, as the saying is, find a stone to throw at a dog. I know Holland; I have seen the wives of Scheveningen scrubbing up for Sunday to the very middle of their brick streets, but I doubt if Dutch cleanliness goes so far without, or comes from so deep a scruple within, as the cleanliness of New England. I felt so keenly the feminine quality of its motive as I passed through that village, that I think if I had dropped so much as a piece of paper in the street I must have knocked at the first door and begged the lady of the house (who would have opened it in person after wiping her hands from her work, taking off her apron, and giving a glance at herself in the mirror and at me through the <b>window</b> <b>blind)</b> to report me to the selectmen in the interest of good morals.|$|E

6000|$|These {{fleeting}} sketches are all republished by kind {{permission of}} the Editor of the DAILY NEWS, in which paper they appeared. They amount {{to no more than}} a sort of sporadic diary--a diary recording one day in twenty which happened to stick in the fancy--the only kind of diary the author has ever been able to keep. Even that diary he could only keep by keeping it in public, for bread and cheese. But trivial as are the topics they are not utterly without a connecting thread of motive. As the reader's eye strays, with hearty relief, from these pages, it probably alights on something, a bed-post or a lamp-post, a <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> or a wall. It is a thousand to one that the reader is looking at something that he has never seen: that is, never realised. He could not write an essay on such a post or wall: he does not know what the post or wall mean. He could not even write the synopsis of an essay; as [...] "The Bed-Post; Its Significance--Security Essential to Idea of Sleep--Night Felt as Infinite--Need of Monumental Architecture," [...] and so on. He could not sketch in outline his theoretic attitude towards window-blinds, even {{in the form of a}} summary. [...] "The Window-Blind--Its Analogy to the Curtain and Veil--Is Modesty Natural?--Worship of and Avoidance of the Sun, etc., etc." [...] None of us think enough of these things on which the eye rests. But don't let us let the eye rest. Why should the eye be so lazy? Let us exercise the eye until it learns to see startling facts that run across the landscape as plain as a painted fence. Let us be ocular athletes. Let us learn to write essays on a stray cat or a coloured cloud. I have attempted some such thing in what follows; but anyone else may do it better, if anyone else will only try.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remained}} awhile {{at the top}} of the stair, {{but with}} the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora's little bed was empty; and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: I perceived an agitation of the <b>window</b> <b>blind,</b> and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it. She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink bare feet and the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave, and I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach. [...] "You naughty: where HAVE you been?"--instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair--feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep. I remember closing my eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. [...] "You were looking for me out of the window?" [...] I said. [...] "You thought I might be walking in the grounds?" ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> {{is a type}} {{of window}} covering. There are many {{different}} kinds of window blinds which use a variety of control systems. A typical <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> is made up of several long horizontal or vertical slats of various types of hard material, including wood, plastic or metal which are held together by cords that run through the blind slats. Window blinds can be maneuvered with either a manual or remote control by rotating them from an open position, with slats spaced out, to a closed position where slats overlap and block out most of the light. There are also several types of window coverings, called shades, that use a single piece of soft material instead of slats.|$|E
50|$|Roman shades are {{a type of}} <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> used {{to block}} out the sun. They are often {{referred}} to as Romans or Roman blinds in the UK. When opened, the Romans stack up evenly; when covering the full window height, they are smooth without overlapping.|$|E
