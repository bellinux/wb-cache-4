5000|$|Veratrum californicum (California corn lily, <b>white</b> or California <b>false</b> <b>hellebore)</b> is a {{poisonous}} plant native to mountain meadows at 3500 to 11,000 ft elevation in southwestern North America, the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains, {{and as far}} north as Alaska and as far south as Durango. [...] It grows 1 to 2 meters tall, with an erect, unbranched, heavily leafy stem resembling a cornstalk. It prefers quite moist soil, and can cover large areas in dense stands near streams or in wet meadows. Many inch-wide flowers cluster along the often-branched top of the stout stem; they have 6 white tepals, a green center, 6 stamens, and a 3-branched pistil (see image below). The buds are tight green spheres. The heavily veined, bright green leaves can be more than a foot long.|$|R

40|$|Veratrum californicum, {{commonly}} referred to as corn lily or Californian <b>false</b> <b>hellebore,</b> grows in high mountain meadows and produces the steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine, a potent inhibitor of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. The Hh pathway is a crucial regulator of many fundamental processes during vertebrate embryonic development. However, constitutive activation of the Hh pathway contributes to the progression of various cancers. In the present study, a direct correlation was made between the extraction efficiency for cyclopamine from root and rhizome by eight methods, and the associated biological activity in Shh-Light II cells using the Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System. Alkaloid recovery ranged from 0. 39 to 8. 03 mg/g, with ethanol soak being determined to be the superior method for obtaining biologically active cyclopamine. Acidic ethanol and supercritical extractions yielded degraded or contaminated cyclopamine with lower antagonistic activity towards Hh signaling...|$|R
5000|$|Genetic defects or toxins can misdirect the {{embryonic}} forebrain-dividing process. One highly teratogenic alkaloid toxin {{that can}} cause cyclopia is cyclopamine or 2-deoxyjervine, found in the plant Veratrum californicum (also known as corn lily or <b>false</b> <b>hellebore).</b> Grazing animals {{are most likely to}} ingest this plant and induce cyclopia in offspring.

Cyclopia occurs when certain proteins are inappropriately expressed, causing the brain to stay whole, rather than developing two distinct hemispheres. This leads to the fetus having one optic lobe and one olfactory lobe, resulting in the eye and nose malformations of cyclopia.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Hedgehog {{signaling}} pathway is essential for embryogenesis and for tissue homeostasis in the adult. However, it may induce malignancies {{in a number of}} tissues when constitutively activated, and it may also have a role in other forms of normal and maladaptive growth. Cyclopamine, a naturally occurring steroidal alkaloid, specifically inhibits the Hedgehog pathway by binding directly to Smoothened, an important Hedgehog response element. To use cyclopamine as a tool to explore and/or inhibit the Hedgehog pathway in vivo, a substantial quantity is required, and as a practical matter cyclopamine has been effectively unavailable for usage in animals larger than mice. Results In this paper, we report a rapid and efficient isolation and purification of large quantities of cyclopamine from the roots and rhizomes of Veratrum californicum Dur. (the Corn Lily or Western <b>false</b> <b>hellebore).</b> We also provide unambiguous assignments of the carbon and proton resonances by using the multinuclear spectra and the spin coupling networks.

40|$|Considerable {{livestock}} losses occur annually as {{the result}} of toxic plants that cause embryonic death, abortion, and fetal abnormalities [1 - 3]. Plant toxins also interfere with reproduction through their effects on male fertility, especially by affecting spermatogenesis. The plant species that have been historically associated with abortion and infertility in livestock are listed in Table 8 - 1. Those plant toxins capable of causing fetal death or deformity are referred to as teratogens. To be a teratogen, a plant toxin must readily cross the placenta at a high enough dose and be present at a specific time in gestation to exert its effect on the developing fetus [3, 4]. In addition, susceptibility to a plant teratogen depends on the animal species, because not all species are equally susceptible to teratogens. In general, the fetus is most susceptible to teratogens during the first trimester of pregnancy. The western <b>false</b> <b>hellebore</b> (Veratrum californicum) is a classical example of a teratogen because it only induces the cyclops deformity in lambs if the pregnant ewe eats sufficient quantity of the plant during the 13 - 14 th days of gestation [5]. Other than plant teratogens, viruses, nutritional imbalances and deficiencies, chemicals (nitrates), and radiation may also be teratogenic and must be considered when determining the cause of congenital deformities. The plants that have been confirmed or suspected of being teratogens in animals are listed in Table 8 - 2.
