25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the hope that people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Red Dragon, like the novel. Michael Mann, who called the new title [...] "inferior", said that producer Dino De Laurentiis made the change after Michael Cimino's film Year of the Dragon, produced by De Laurentiis, bombed at the box office in 1985. William Petersen has commented that another reason for the change was to avoid any suggestion that it might be a karate movie. [...] "At the time, Bruce Lee was knocking out Dragon movies, and Dino, in his wisdom, decided people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a kung-fu movie", he later recalled. Brian Cox, who played jailed killer Hannibal Lecktor, has also expressed disdain for the film's title, calling it [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "cheesy".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market-based philosophies. Alan Grant commented on the philosophical pattern the character's transformation took for a 1997 interview: [...] "Although I haven’t read them in chronological order I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be quite easy to see the parallel between Anarky’s thought processes and my own thought processes." [...] By 1997 he had settled on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. At approximately the same time he was when given the opportunity to write an Anarky mini-series, and so decided to revamp the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was later carried on in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E

500|$|Drawing on André Maurois' Les Silences du colonel Bramble, Hergé {{presents}} Tintin as a big-game hunter, accidentally killing fifteen antelope {{as opposed}} to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals led Tintins Scandinavian publishers to request changes. A page of Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive; Hergé replaced the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle while he sleeps under a tree. In 2007, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint, stating, [...] "It beggars belief that {{in this day and age}} that any shop <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> acceptable to sell and display Tintin in the Congo." [...] In August 2007, a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people. Public prosecutors investigated, and a criminal case was initiated, although the matter was transferred to a civil court. Belgium's Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against [...] "over-reaction and hyper political correctness".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News, who did {{not like}} [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] proved the series could be funny. He {{specifically}} complimented the episode's commentary on American consumerism. Simon wrote, [...] "It's all very bitter social satire, and if it weren't on Comedy Central, believe me, no one in networkland <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> ready for prime time. And you know what else? It's funny." [...] Likewise, The Washington Post critic Tom Shales strongly criticized [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", but said the second episode was funny and included [...] "cleverly intertwined" [...] plot-lines. Shales said, [...] " [...] suggests the show may be an attempt at satire and not just poopy humor ... Yes, it's still sick and still twisted, but somehow this episode at least appears to have some comic ingenuity behind it, whereas the first was just a smutfest." [...] In 2006, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was identified by Winnipeg Free Press {{as one of the}} ten most memorable South Park episodes, and ranked twelfth in a list of the top 25 greatest Cartman moments, as determined by voters on the Comedy Central website.

500|$|Sinatra started 1967 with {{a series}} of {{recording}} sessions with Antônio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim, {{which was one of the}} best-selling albums of the year, behind the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. According to Santopietro the album [...] "consists of an extraordinarily effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret". Writer Stan Cornyn noted that Sinatra sang so softly on the album that it was comparable to the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950. Sinatra also released the album The World We Knew, which features a chart-topping duet of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] with daughter Nancy. In December, Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album Francis A. & Edward K.. According to Granata, the recording of [...] "Indian Summer" [...] on the album was a favorite of Riddle's, noting the [...] "contemplative mood [...] is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that will bring a tear to your eye". With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote the song [...] "My Way", using the melody of the French [...] "Comme d'habitude" [...] ("As Usual"), composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Sinatra recorded it just after Christmas 1968. [...] "My Way", Sinatra's best-known song on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at #27 in the US and #5 in the UK, but it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and September 1971, which was still a record in 2015. Sinatra told songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he [...] "detested" [...] singing the song, because he believed audiences <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a [...] "self-aggrandizing tribute", professing that he [...] "hated boastfulness in others".|$|E

So, I grew up modifying the piano, shall we say, which made my mother gasp in horror, and my father <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was fantastic when I would attach chainsaws and stuff like that to the piano because he thought it was an evolution in technology."

[...] For when Ibn Battuta visited Balkh around 1333 during {{the rule of the}} Kartids, who were Tadjik vassals of the Persia-based Mongol Ilkhanate until 1335, he described it as a city still in ruins: [...] "It is completely dilapidated and uninhabited, but anyone seeing it <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> to be inhabited because of the solidity of its construction (for it was a vast and important city), and its mosques and colleges preserve their outward appearance even now, with the inscriptions on their buildings incised with lapis-blue paints." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 16th century, Lê Anh Tông of the Lê Dynasty {{encouraged}} traders {{to visit}} Vietnam by opening up Thăng Long (Hanoi), Huế and Hội An. Chinese {{presence in the}} Huế/Hội An area dated back as early as 1444, when a monk from Fujian built the Buddhist temple, Chua Chuc Thanh. Hội An quickly developed into a trading port from the 16th century onwards, when Chinese and Japanese traders began to arrive in the city in greater numbers. When an Italian Jesuit priest, Father Christofo Borri, visited the city in 1618, he aptly described the city as: [...] "The city of Faifo is so vast that one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is two juxtaposed cities; a Chinese city and a Japanese city." [...] The Japanese traders quickly disappeared by {{the first half of}} the 17th century as Tokugawa shogunate imposed a policy of self-isolation, and when Dutch traders such as Francisco Groemon [...] visited Hội An in 1642, the Japanese population was no more than 50 people, while the Chinese numbered some 5,000 individuals.|$|E

2500|$|Boam, who {{was raised}} Catholic, used many {{religious}} themes and metaphors in his script for the film. In preparing the story, he studied grail literature, but ultimately invented new mythology. He made the grail a symbol for faith. He said, [...] "I guess the major given of faith is that it can't be proved otherwise you don't need faith. So that is why I created {{the idea that the}} grail can't be removed (from its hiding place). You can find the grail, but you can't really prove that you found it." [...] When Indiana Jones finally discovers the grail hidden among decoys, its knight guardian tells him that he will die if he drinks from the wrong cup. Boam said that this scene is a metaphor for [...] "the one true God vs. false gods". He worried that the film's religious themes would face criticism from the general audience, as well as religious scholars. He was relieved when the criticism didn't appear, saying, [...] "Nobody working on this movie was a religious scholar...

On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic."
