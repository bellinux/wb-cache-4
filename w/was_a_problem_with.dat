These machines, which are in use in 35 municipalities, including Amsterdam, have to be improved or replaced with an alternative before the elections. Many municipalities, including Amsterdam, decided to switch to the traditional pen and red pencil method of voting instead of the SDU machines. Machines made by Nedap are still in use.|$|E
25|$|Because Yarkoni was not Jewish, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> burying {{him in the}} Military Cemetery at Kiryat Shaul.

There was an outcry over the unseemliness of the {{impediment}} to burying a hero of the stature of Amos Yarkoni in a Military Cemetery. The matter was resolved quickly when Rehavam Zeevi, Yarkoni's lifelong friend and comrade, purchased a grave in the cemetery for himself, allowing Yarkoni to be buried {{at the end of}} the row, and therefore technically not in the Jewish part of the cemetery.|$|E

25|$|In May 2014 the NHTSA fined {{the company}} $35 million {{for failing to}} recall cars with faulty {{ignition}} switches for a decade, despite knowing there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the switches.

General Motors has announced that they are also facing 79 customer lawsuits asking {{for as much as}} $10 billion for economic losses attributed to the recall. As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice.

Fincke and Magnus tested latches on the Exposed Facility Berthing Mechanism for the Japanese Kibo laboratory. Magnus {{continued}} with the installation of the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA), while engineers on the ground worked through troubleshooting of the Urine Processor Assembly. The component ran initially on Thursday evening, but shut itself down during that initial test, and shut down again the following morning after two hours of operations. Engineers were considering if the issue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the sensors, or with the centrifuge motor. At 17:10, Ferguson and Boe used the shuttle's engines to reboost the station's altitude, raising it by about one nautical mile to prepare for the next Progress arrival.|$|E
25|$|NBC used Don Sutton as a pre- and post-game {{analyst for}} their 1987 LCS coverage. Sutton also made an {{appearance}} in the booth during Game 3 of the ALCS. Sutton talked with Bob Costas and Tony Kubek about Twins pitcher Les Straker's borderline balk in that game. Sutton later interviewed Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson following their loss in Game 5. Meanwhile, Marv Albert went back-and-forth during both 1987 LCS. He hosted the pregame for Game 1 of the NLCS with Joe Morgan, and in fact had to read the lineups to the viewing audience. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the P.A. feed at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, so he ended up reading the script from the Cardinal dugout while the players {{were introduced to the}} crowd. He then went to Minneapolis the next night to host the ALCS pregame with Don Sutton at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Jimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame coverage for Game 5 of the NLCS, as Marv Albert was away on a boxing assignment for NBC.|$|E
25|$|On {{day four}} of the enquiry, {{evidence}} was given by Imperial Airways Inspector of Engines that no example of the petrol pipe used on the aircraft had been rejected due to internal obstruction leading to reduced flow of fuel. He stated that he was satisfied that the engine was serviceable {{at the time of}} departure. Captain Barnard, who flew G-EBBY to Paris shortly after the accident had occurred, disagreed with a suggestion put to him that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the engine, saying that he did not think anyone could give a cause for the crash, other than the aircraft having stalled. Further evidence was heard as to the loading of the aircraft. The maintenance regime at Imperial Airways and the reliability of the de Havilland DH.34 were called into question by Mr Beyfus, a legal representative of one of the victims. Two witnesses from the aircraft's insurers gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was to the company's satisfaction. The Imperial Airways manager at Amsterdam corroborated Hinchcliffe's earlier evidence. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.|$|E

25|$|The second non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 14 January 1969. It involved a BUA mainline BAC One-Eleven 201AC (registration: G-ASJJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Milan's Linate Airport to London Gatwick. This {{was the same}} aircraft BUA had used to operate the One-Eleven's inaugural revenue service. On {{the day of the}} accident, the aircraft had been diverted to Linate on the outbound flight because of fog at Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo Airport. A normal take-off run was followed by a bang immediately after the aircraft had become airborne. The captain in the jumpseat who was supervising the co-pilot at the time thought that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the no. 1 engine. He advised the pilot in command to close the throttle a short while later. The pilot in command followed this advice and lowered the nose pitch from 12 to six degrees. The engine shutdown was accompanied by an decrease in airspeed from 140 knots (161mph/ 259km/h to 115 kn (132mph / 212km/h). Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing on snow-covered sand about two miles from the end of runway 18, there were no fatalities among the 33 occupants (seven crew and 26 passengers) though there were two serious injuries. The accident investigators concluded that this crash was caused by the crew failing to recognise their mistake, which had resulted in shutting down the wrong engine (no. 1) in error following a compressor bang/surge in the no. 2 engine. In addition, the crew did not notice that an inadvertent movement of the relevant throttle lever had partially reduced the no. 2 engine's thrust.|$|E

[...] This change solved the problem; quarters from 1925 and after are more common and cheaper in lower grades as they have survived with their dates intact. [...] This action was among the last acts of the Engraver's Department under Morgan, who died on January 4, 1925 and was succeeded by John R. Sinnock. [...] The modification meant that the 1927-S, with a mintage of 396,000 is much cheaper in circulated grades than the 1923-S, with a mintage of 1,360,000, though the 1927-S is more expensive in uncirculated grades.|$|E

500|$|The year 1933 was a busy one for Barrymore, and his decline {{began to}} be evident. He {{appeared}} in five films during the year, including as a meek schoolteacher-turned-businessman in Topaze, opposite Myrna Loy, and Dinner at Eight, with Lionel. Peters opines that Barrymore's portrayal of a washed-up alcoholic actor [...] "could well have fixed... in the public's and MGM's mind that John Barrymore was a drunken has-been." [...] After the run of films with MGM, the company ended its contact with Barrymore amid its financial woes caused by the Great Depression. He then signed with Universal Studios to portray a troubled Jewish lawyer in Counsellor at Law. During filming he struggled to remember his lines for even small scenes. Filming was stopped on one occasion after more than 25 takes when he struggled to recall the right lines; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> which he began to suffer regularly. Despite the problems, Norden believes that this was [...] "one of his best film performances".|$|E
500|$|Bird {{combined}} {{his knowledge}} from {{his years in}} television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team-building, and his tenure on The Simpsons {{as an example of}} working under strict deadlines. He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly. One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes—something Bird thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> modern filmmaking. [...] "There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It's almost as if the audience has the remote and they're going to change channels," [...] he commented at the time. Storyboard artist Teddy Newton {{played an important role in}} shaping the film's story. Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the [...] "hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening." [...] Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the [...] "Duck and Cover sequence" [...] came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film.
