5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century Scottish {{scientists}} James Clerk Maxwell and David Brewster played a major part {{in the development of the}} techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist Robert Adamson (1821–48) and artist David Octavius Hill (1821–48), who as Hill & Adamson formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 calotype images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included Thomas Annan (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to use the medium as a social record. His son James Craig Annan (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill & Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable photogravure process. Other important figures included Thomas Keith (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers, George Washington Wilson (1823–93), who pioneered instant photography and Clementina Hawarden (1822–65), whose posed portraits <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> in a tradition of female photography.|$|E

Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|People {{from small}} {{villages in the}} hills near Genova, Italy <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to settle {{permanently}} in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters.

The data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded {{for the first time}} in history. In addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces, E-3 controllers assisted in 38 of the 41 air-to-air kills recorded during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Tang founded The Artists Village. The first art colony to be {{established}} in Singapore, it aimed to encourage artists to create experimental art.

There, Tang mentored younger artists and informed them about artistic developments {{in other parts of the}} world.

Blyton concluded several of her long-running series in 1963, publishing the last books of The Famous Five (Five Are Together Again) and The Secret Seven (Fun for the Secret Seven); she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge: Brer Rabbit Again, Brer Rabbit Book, and Brer Rabbit's a Rascal. In 1962 many of her books <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to be published by Armada Books in paperback, making them more affordable to children.|$|E
5|$|Misperceptions of the Dixie Mission {{contributed to}} the {{nationwide}} Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s. Thawing relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in the 1970s opened a new chapter for the mission. For the first time, the mission and its participants {{became the subject of}} serious scholarship, and many of the mission participants <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Americans invited to visit China in twenty years. In China, the Dixie Mission is remembered as a positive time between the two nations, and a symbol of Sino-American cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near {{their homes or}} by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped {{with a variety of}} adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire {{plays a major role in}} the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, the {{investigations}} into the disappearance of De Mauro by the Carabinieri and the police followed widely divergent leads. Colonel Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and Captain Giuseppe Russo of the Carabinieri <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{to work on his}} case. Years later, and in different circumstances, both were murdered by the Mafia. They focused on the lead of drug trafficking. According to them, the journalist would have been a victim of lupara bianca after discovering leads on drug trafficking by the Mafia between Sicily and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E
5|$|Sheep <b>were</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{animals to}} be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs {{may be over}} 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) {{and not on the}} scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E
