5|$|Keate was {{followed}} by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby's view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>the</b> only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham's Ingoldsby Legends (1847) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun {{in one of the}} vaults and ensuring God’s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, {{while at the same time}} showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins.|$|E

Ebony magazine termed Rangel's ascent to the chairmanship [...] "a watershed moment for African-Americans, who historically have been shut out when it comes to deciding how to divvy up the trillions of dollars in the federal government's budget."

The {{popular and}} acclaimed All the President's Men (1976), directed by Alan J. Pakula and scripted once again by Goldman, was a landmark film for Redford.

2500|$|Stravinsky {{displayed}} a taste in literature that was wide and reflected his constant desire for new discoveries. The texts and literary sources {{for his work}} began with a period of interest in Russian folklore, which progressed to classical authors and the Latin liturgy {{and moved on to}} contemporary France (André Gide, in Persephone) and eventually English literature, including Auden, T. S. Eliot and medieval English verse. He also had an inexhaustible desire to explore and learn about art, which manifested itself in several of his Paris collaborations. Not only <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>the</b> principal composer for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but he also collaborated with Picasso (Pulcinella, 1920), Jean Cocteau ( [...] , 1927), and George Balanchine ( [...] , 1928). His interest in art propelled him to develop a strong relationship with Picasso, whom he met in 1917, announcing that in [...] "a whirlpool of artistic enthusiasm and excitement I at last met Picasso." [...] From 1917 to 1920, the two engaged in an artistic dialogue in which they exchanged small-scale works of art to each other as a sign of intimacy, which included the famous portrait of Stravinsky by Picasso, and Stravinsky's [...] "Sketch of Music for the Clarinet". This exchange was essential to establish how the artists would approach their collaborative space in Pulcinella.|$|E
2500|$|Sullivan next {{joined the}} company of Selina Dolaro at the Royalty Theatre, opening on 30 January 1875 {{in the role of}} Don Andres, the British Viceroy, in Offenbach's La Périchole. [...] Richard D'Oyly Carte was manager of the theatre for Dolaro, and when one of La Péricholes {{companion}} pieces proved weak, Carte asked Gilbert to collaborate with Arthur Sullivan to write a one-act piece, Trial by Jury, for the theatre. [...] Gilbert and Sullivan wrote the role of the Learned Judge for Fred Sullivan, and Trial by Jury opened at the Royalty 25 March 1875. [...] Fred also continued to play Don Andres. [...] Sullivan was made up for the role of the Learned Judge to look like the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Alexander Cockburn. [...] The first-night critics reserved especial praise for his performance: [...] "The greatest 'hit' was made by Mr. F. Sullivan, whose blending of official dignity, condescension, and, at the right moment, extravagant humour, made the character of the Judge stand out with all requisite prominence, and added much to the interest of the piece." [...] The Times concurred: [...] "Mr. F. Sullivan's impersonation of the learned and impressionable Judge deserves a special word of praise for its quiet and natural humour." [...] Sullivan's performance was the hit of the show. [...] F. C. Burnand wrote of him: [...] "Fred Sullivan, Arthur's brother, {{was one of the most}} naturally comic little men I ever came across. [...] He, too, was a first-rate practical musician. ... As he was the most absurd person, so <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>the</b> very kindliest. [...] The brothers were devoted to each other".|$|E
