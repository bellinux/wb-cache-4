Each class consequently uses a different fighting style: the Kanbus focuses on dual <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> one-hit attacks, the Koas focuses {{on a combination of}} attack and healing abilities, the Dark sacrifices health to deal heavier damage, Gunners specialize in long-range attacks, Battlers focuses on melee attacks, and the Somas use long-range magic over close-range physical attacks. Weapons are equipped based on a character's class, and can be upgraded using special items called Orbs. <b>Weapons</b> <b>and</b> items collected through exploration and from enemy drops can be sold to other players through wireless connection.|$|E
