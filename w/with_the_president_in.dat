Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.)

Because FDR could not be awakened after he went to bed at night without LeHand's permission, she was the first person to learn by telephone that Hitler had invaded Poland in September 1939, setting off World War II.

500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? How are things in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that, in her final meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> 1986, Reagan {{did not seem to}} know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E

After Crawford declined to remain Secretary of the Treasury, Adams appointed former ambassador Richard Rush to the position. Adams chose Henry Clay, who had backed Adams in the 1825 contingent election, as Secretary of State, leading to accusations of a [...] "Corrupt Bargain" [...] from followers of Jackson. To fill the position of Secretary of War, which Calhoun had vacated upon his election as vice president, Adams chose Senator James Barbour of Virginia. Opposing Adams's expansive vision for the federal government, Vice President Calhoun quickly broke <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> <b>In</b> 1826, he informed Jackson that he would support him for president, and Calhoun became a key opponent of Adams in the Senate.

2500|$|Returning from Europe, Roosevelt urged {{progressives}} to {{take control}} of the Republican Party at the state and local level, and to avoid splitting the party in a way that would hand the presidency to the Democrats in 1912. Additionally, Roosevelt expressed optimism about the Taft Administration after meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> the White House in June 1910. In August 1910, Roosevelt gave notable speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, which was the most radical of his career and initiated his public break with the Taft administration and the conservative Republicans. Advocating a program of [...] "New Nationalism", Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests, a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions. Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle {{to take control}} of the state Republican party from William Barnes, Jr., Tom Platt's successor as the state party boss. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention. Roosevelt nonetheless campaigned for the Republicans in the 1910 elections, which saw the Democrats gain control of the House for the first time since the 1890s. Among the newly elected Democrats was New York state senator Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who argued that he represented his cousin's policies better than his Republican opponent.|$|E

The President advises the interior line between Washington and the enemy, but does not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as soon as possible. You will immediately report what line you adopt, and when you intend to cross the river; also to what point the reinforcements are to be sent. It is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively determined on, before orders are given for building bridges and repairing railroads.

6000|$|Hamilton, in his reply, {{while he}} {{considered}} it a primary object for the public good that {{the dignity of the}} presidential office should be supported, advised that care should be taken to avoid so high a tone in the demeanor of the occupant, as to shock the prevalent notions of equality. The President, he thought, should hold a levee at a fixed time once a week, remain half an hour, converse cursorily on indifferent subjects with such persons as invited his attention, and then retire. He should accept no invitations, give formal entertainments twice, or at most, four times in the year; on levee days to give informal invitations to family dinners; not more than six or eight to be asked at a time, and the civility to be confined essentially to members of the legislature, and other official characters--the President never to remain long at table. The heads of departments should, of course, have access to the President on business. Foreign ministers of some descriptions should also be entitled to it. Members of the Senate should also have a right of individual access on matters relative to the public administration. The reason alleged by Hamilton for giving the Senate this privilege, and not the Representatives, was, that in the constitution [...] "the Senate are coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> certain executive functions, treaties, and appointments. This makes them in a degree his constitutional counsellors, and give them a peculiar claim to the right of access." ...|$|E
