5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was born}} {{an only child}} on 17 November 1876 in Jhansi, {{in the state of}} Uttar Pradesh, India. His father Hesketh Brodrick Prichard, an officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, died from typhoid six <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was born, leading him to be raised alone by his mother, Kate O'Brien Ryall Prichard. She herself had come from a {{military}} family, her father being Major-General Browne William Ryall.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Linden was {{selected}} {{as a member of}} Team Canada in the 1998 Nagano Olympics. Though he injured his knee only <b>weeks</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> played in all six games, scoring one goal, a game-tying marker with 67 seconds left against the Czech Republic that sent the semi-final game to overtime. Canada finished fourth in the tournament. Later that summer, he participated in the 1998 World Championships. He scored one goal and four assists as Canada finished fifth.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, La Fleche {{was already}} in foal when racing in 1894 and {{produced}} her first foal, a filly called La Veine in 1895. In 1896 Maurice de Hirsch died and all his bloodstock, including La Fleche and La Veine were put up for auction. She was sold for £12,600 to Marcus Beresford, acting on this occasion on behalf the Sykes family and was sent to their Sledmere Stud in Yorkshire. Sir Tatton Sykes, who was reportedly horrified by the price, initially refused to acknowledge the mare’s arrival, and left her in a railway box for two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was persuaded to accept the deal.|$|E

60|$|The {{following}} morning {{he set out}} and journeyed to the spot, where, on leaving his retainers more than a <b>week</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> had ordered them to await his coming. It was another <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> obtained such news as enabled him again to join the king, who was staying at a woodcutter's hut in Selkirk Forest. Hector {{came out with a}} deep bark of welcome.|$|R

5|$|Fingleton then scored his maiden {{first-class}} {{century of}} 117 {{in less than}} four hours in the following match, against the touring South Africa, helping his team to 3/430 in their runchase. The hosts were 18 runs short of victory when time ran out. Although Fingleton made only five in New South Wales' second match against the South Africans, Fingleton was selected for the Test series against the same team. This came after only ten matches for his state. Starting with the Second Test, he was twelfth man for three consecutive Tests, and as a result, did not play any cricket for six <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> added a pair of 40s in a win over arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Prior to filming, Peirce {{researched}} the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case. She immersed {{herself in the}} information available about the murder, including trial transcripts. She met Lana Tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at Tisdel's home. Tisdel, who began dating Brandon just two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was murdered, was 19 {{years old at the}} time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother. Peirce also interviewed Tisdel's mother and Brandon's friends. However, she was unable to interview Brandon's mother or any of his biological family. Much factual information, including Nissen being a convicted arsonist, was incorporated into Boys Don't Cry.|$|E
5|$|She {{was briefly}} married again in 2002 {{to a life}} coach, whom she met when her mother {{convinced}} her to hire him. They dated for two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> proposed; they were married six months later, and the marriage ended two months after that. At the wedding, Ray Traylor (also known as Big Boss Man), her friend and traveling partner, gave her away. In 2003, she began a relationship with Tyree Clowe, a US soldier 15 years her junior. The couple remained together for over five years.|$|E
50|$|Williams's date {{of death}} was {{estimated}} {{to have been in}} the early hours of 16 August, one <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was found.|$|R
25|$|Harold {{only later}} learned that Wilfred {{had been killed in}} action on 4 November 1918, a <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had {{apparently}} appeared to him on Astraea.|$|R
50|$|On 22 October 2014, Nabor died at Punta Gorda Hospital, {{following}} a stroke the <b>week</b> <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Punta Gorda.|$|R
5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E
25|$|Humehume was pursued {{for several}} <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was {{captured}} and brought before Kalanimoku, who spared his life.|$|E
25|$|His death came {{less than}} three <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> hoped to win an eighth term in office. Lee had {{qualified}} {{to run in the}} October 20 primary against Harahan Police Chief Peter Dale and contractor Julio Castillo. State law requires qualifying to reopen if a candidate dies before the election is held.|$|E
50|$|Park died in March 1956, {{at the age}} of 29. He {{died from}} heart failure after he drank in Myeongdong and came back home. One <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, he wrote a poem titled 'If times flow,' which became popular all over Korea.|$|R
50|$|Taft {{was active}} {{until the end}} of his life. The <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, he {{attended}} the Quincy, Illinois, dedication ceremonies for his sculpture celebrating the Lincoln-Douglas debates.|$|R

25|$|In Morocco she met {{her future}} husband a young French officer, Count André Benzoni di Conza born in Corsica, they married a few <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was {{assigned}} to leave for Indochina to join his regiment. Because of the unstable situation in Morocco at that time, her husband wished that she return to France.|$|E
25|$|Haarmann avoided {{serving his}} {{sentence}} throughout 1919. That October, he met an 18-year-old youth named Hans Grans, {{who had run}} away {{from his home in}} Berlin following an argument with his father on 1 October. Grans had slept rough in and around Hanover station for approximately two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> encountered Haarmann as he (Grans) sold old clothes at Hanover station.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{had other}} {{interests}} outside cricket, though he {{appears not to}} have had a career or profession. He was a captain in the Robin Hood Rifles, a volunteer army unit raised in Nottinghamshire and he also played football for Worksop Town F. C.. He was also engaged in field sports and a fall from his horse while hunting two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died was thought to have accelerated his death, which was unexpected.|$|E
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 27 October 1726. One <b>week</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> had also concluded a solo cantata by a chorale, the cantata for alto Gott soll allein mein Herze haben, BWV 169.|$|R

50|$|Sandy {{kept working}} happily in his chosen field until a <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died—at {{the age of}} 88—on his last book. At last count, over 33 species of insects have been named after him by other entomologists.|$|R
25|$|Asquith {{planned the}} 1908 budget, {{but by the}} time he {{presented}} it to the Commons he was no longer Chancellor. Campbell-Bannerman's health had been failing for nearly a year. After a series of heart attacks he resigned on 3 April 1908, less than three <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died. Asquith was universally accepted as the natural successor. King Edward, who was on holiday in Biarritz, sent for Asquith, who took the boat train to France and kissed hands as prime minister in the Hôtel du Palais, Biarritz on 7 April.|$|E
25|$|In late 2003, Toto headlined Night of the Proms for {{two months}} straight. Paich {{returned}} but was only able {{to play for a}} few <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had to leave again, so Phillinganes once again filled in {{for the remainder of the}} shows. In early 2004, the band embarked on a world tour that went throughout 2004 and 2005. Paich only occasionally appeared, with Phillinganes playing at most of the shows. In 2005, Phillinganes was asked to become a regular member of the band and Paich retired from touring. Paich was still a member of Toto, however, as he continued to record and produce on all of Toto's releases.|$|E
25|$|His murder {{garnered}} {{national attention}} and reactions {{from the highest}} levels of the Mexican government, including from President Enrique Peña Nieto and the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. Attacks against federal judges like Bermúdez Zacarías were a rare occurrence in the ongoing Mexican Drug War since organized crime groups rarely targeted high-ranking judicial officials. The President ordered to have the investigation under federal jurisdiction. Investigators discovered that two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was killed, Bermúdez Zacarías suspected that two men were following him. He called the police one day on his way home, but did not request to have security measures in place for his daily activities.|$|E
60|$|Cuthbert saw {{the justice}} of the reasoning, and it was another <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> {{announced}} himself as feeling absolutely restored to strength again, and capable of bearing as much exertion as {{he could have done}} before his attack.|$|R
60|$|He put {{his plans}} in hand at once, and a <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> sailed again had {{disposed}} of the house. Some {{of the furniture}} he kept for himself; {{but the bulk of}} it went to his sister as conscience-money.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 2011 season, Clark {{ranked as}} the second leading rusher in Air Force Academy history. He was removed from the Air Force Academy in May 2012, less than one <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was due to graduate.|$|R
25|$|Two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> {{planned to}} {{complete}} the symphony-requiem, Shostakovich played what he had finished to date for Sollertinsky, who was being evacuated with the Leningrad Philharmonic. While playing the music, Shostakovich realized that what he had written was not a complete work in itself but actually the beginning of something much larger, since the tensions {{brought up in the}} symphony-requiem had not been resolved. The question now became whether to stay in the city to continue working or to evacuate and resume the work after a long hiatus. By the time he decided to evacuate, it was too late—the Germans had cut off the rail link to the city. He and his family were trapped.|$|E
25|$|Filming {{began on}} January 14, 1991 at Pinewood Studios without a {{finished}} script and with $7 million already having been spent. While {{a majority of}} the film was shot at Pinewood, some scenes were shot at Blyth Power Station in Northumberland, UK. The purpose of these shots were to show the exterior of the planet. Cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth worked only for two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> started suffering from Parkinson's disease, and was forced out of the film by a line producer who had lost his father to the disease several years previously, and knew that if anything, the demanding schedule would likely take a fatal toll on Cronenweth's health. He was replaced by Alex Thomson.|$|E
25|$|Bain {{returned}} to command of Harpy a few <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> received promotion to post captain on 6 April 1813. Commander Thomas Griffith Allen replaced Bain that month. However, {{he died on}} 26 (or 28) September 1814, at Port Louis. Command devolved on Lieutenant William Lambert, Harpys first lieutenant. Earlier, in July, Lambert had led her boats in the rescue, at great risk, of {{the crew of the}} schooner Eugenie, which had wrecked on Sandy Island (near Mauritius) on 19 April. During the rescue the master and a seaman from Harpy drowned when their boat overturned. After Allen's death, Robert Townsend Farquhar, governor of Mauritius, wrote to Lambert, pressing on him the importance of maintaining Harpys highly successful anti-slavery mission.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Andrews was engaged to Alice B. Paterakis of Athens, Greece, whom he had met at the American Academy in Rome, where both had been fellows. They were to be married the <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died.|$|R
