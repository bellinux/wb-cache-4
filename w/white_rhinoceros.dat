5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fari√±a (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceros,</b> which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceros)</b> participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals.|$|E

40|$|Breeding {{performance}} in captive southern <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> is disappointing. The same {{applies to the}} two female southern <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. Since these females have never produced offspring, the reproductive status is examined in this study. With the use of non-invasive monitoring, by measuring fecal progesterone and by observing behavior related to the estrous, one could make some assumptions about their reproductive cyclicity. The peaks and nadirs in the progesterone profiles, indicate that both females are cyclic, with cycle lengths of respectively 30, 5 days and 36 days. Furthermore, both females showed mating behavior, which occurred on the day progesterone concentrations were at a nadir (taking in account the gastrointestinal transit time), underlining {{that they were in}} estrous. However, the timespan of this study and the regularity of sample collection were not sufficient to draw firm conclusions. A long-term study with a more regular sample collection would give more comprehensive hormone profiles. Simultaneously performing ultrasonographic examination would provide valuable data to gain more knowledge about the failure in reproducing of the two female southern <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Gaining {{knowledge}} of the reproductive status of wild animals can provide invaluable information that may assist in making appropriate conservation management programs. This study {{was a part of}} a long term non-invasive reproductive study in wild southern <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> (Ceratotherium simum simum) females in the Lapalala Wilderness in South Africa. Six females were monitored non-invasively using fecal progestagen analysis during a 4 months period. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the oestrus cycle of wild female <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> and to non-invasively determine pregnancy. Fresh fecal samples were attempted to be collected on a regular basis (ideally twice per week) from each of the six females. The samples were freeze-dried and extracted and an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed. The fecal progestagen profiles were highly variable between the different females. Because of the difficulty of finding the rhinoceroses on a regular basis it proved to be difficult to determine the oestrus cycles of these females. However, the progestagen profiles showed a significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant periods. Non-invasive measurement of progestagen levels could therefore be implicated in wildlife management for determining pregnancy in wild female <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceroses...</b>|$|R

In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went to Los Angeles, he bought a DEC Rainbow. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an Apricot, then a BBC Micro and a Tandy 1000. In Last Chance to See Adams mentions his Cambridge Z88, which he had taken to Zaire on a quest to find the northern <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceros.</b>|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to link the wear on Elasmotherium teeth to grazing. In 1938, H.E. Wood, a Rhinocerotid tooth specialist, pointed out that {{interproximal}} wear, or loss of tooth surface between teeth, due to abrasion during mastication, of Elasmotherium {{is similar to that of}} the <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceros,</b> the only remaining Rhinocerotid grazer, which has hypsodont teeth. Data such as this led to an intuitive concept of some sort of correlation between grass-eating and hypsodonty, but it has been difficult to isolate mathematically.|$|E
50|$|While {{the black}} {{rhinoceros}} has 84 chromosomes (diploid number, 2N, per cell), all other rhinoceros species have 82 chromosomes.

500|$|Zoologist Robert M. Alexander has {{suggested}} that overheating {{may have been a}} serious problem in Paraceratherium due to its size. According to Prothero, the best living analogues for Paraceratherium may be large mammals such as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. To aid in thermoregulation, these animals cool down during the day by resting in the shade or by wallowing in water and mud. They also forage and move mainly at night. Because of its large size, Paraceratherium {{would not have been able}} to run and move quickly, but they would have been able to cross large distances, which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food. They may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory. Prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least [...] and that, because of a scarcity of resources, there would have been little room in Asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera. This principle is called competitive exclusion; it is used to explain how the black rhinoceros (a browser) and <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> (a grazer) exploit different niches in the same areas of Africa.|$|E
500|$|The {{pre-eminent}} {{position of}} D√ºrer's image and its derivatives declined from the mid-to-late-18th century, when more live rhinoceroses were transported to Europe, {{shown to the}} curious public, and depicted in more accurate representations. Jean-Baptiste Oudry painted a life-size portrait of Clara the rhinoceros in 1749, and George Stubbs painted a large portrait of a rhinoceros in London around 1790. Both of these paintings were more accurate than D√ºrer's woodcut, and a more realistic conception of the rhinoceros gradually started to displace D√ºrer's image in the public imagination. In particular, Oudry's painting was the inspiration for a plate in Buffon's encyclopedic Histoire naturelle, which was widely copied. In 1790, James Bruce's travelogue Travels to discover {{the source of the}} Nile dismissed D√ºrer's work as [...] "wonderfully ill-executed in all its parts" [...] and [...] "the origin of all the monstrous forms under which that animal has been painted, ever since". Even so, Bruce's own illustration of the African <b>white</b> <b>rhinoceros,</b> which is noticeably different in appearance to the Indian rhinoceros, still shares conspicuous inaccuracies with D√ºrer's work. Semiotician Umberto Eco argues (fetching the idea from E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, 1961) that D√ºrer's [...] "scales and imbricated plates" [...] became a necessary element of depicting the animal, even to those who might know better, because [...] "they knew that only these conventionalized graphic signs could denote ¬´rhinoceros¬ª to the person interpreting the iconic sign." [...] He also notes that the skin of a rhinoceros is rougher than it visually appears and that such plates and scales portray this non-visual information to a degree.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, the zoo's current rhino, Mandala, {{was joined}} by ten-year-old male, Kruger; 13-year-old female, Mzithi; and 18-month-old female, Mbili.
