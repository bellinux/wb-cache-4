Now today <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E
500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and what would make life wonderful for them...

Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's {{alive in the}}m... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset.

[...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E

500|$|According to {{academic}} Rikky Rooksby, [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] {{is an example}} of Brian Wilson's growing interest in musical development within a composition, something antithetical to popular music of the time. Suppressing tonic strength and cadential drive, the song makes use of descending harmonic motions through scale degrees controlled by a single tonic and [...] "radical disjunctions" [...] in key, texture, instrumentation, and mood while refusing to develop into a predictable formal pattern. It instead develops [...] "under its own power" [...] and [...] "luxuriates in harmonic variety" [...] exemplified by beginning and ending not only in different keys but also in different modes. Comparing [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] to Wilson's previous work Pet Sounds, biographer Andrew Hickey has said: [...] "he best way of thinking about [...] is that it's taking the lowest common denominator of 'Here Today' and 'God Only Knows' and turned the result into an R track. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> minor-key change between verse and chorus we've seen throughout Pet Sounds, the same descending scalar chord sequences, the same mobile bass parts, but here, rather than to express melancholy, these things are used in a way that's as close as Brian Wilson ever got to funky." [...] Author Jon Stebbins adds that [...] "unlike Pet Sounds the chorus of 'Good Vibrations' projects a definite 'rock and roll' energy and feel." ...|$|E

Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar.

2500|$|Both the Doctor and the Master {{have been}} shown to be skilled hypnotists, {{although}} the Master's capacity to dominate – even by stare and voice alone – has been shown to be far more pronounced. In Logopolis the Doctor said of the Master, [...] "He's a Time Lord. In many ways, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mind." [...] The Master is often able to anticipate the Doctor's moves, as seen in stories such as Castrovalva, The Keeper of Traken, Time-Flight, and The King's Demons, where he plans elaborate traps for the Doctor, only revealing his presence at the key moment. In The Deadly Assassin, the Master was able to send a false premonition as a telepathic message to the Doctor, but it is unclear whether he performed this through innate psychic ability, or was aided technologically.|$|E

2500|$|He {{continued}} {{being an}} outspoken observer of Serbian politics and Serb society in general. In a May 2008 interview, following the Serbian parliamentary election, {{he used the}} fact that the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Šešelj, Tomislav Nikolić, and Aleksandar Vučić received 1.2 million votes {{as a starting point for}} a wider comment on Serbian society: [...] "Political parties aren't the problem in Serbia. The problem here is the society that votes for those parties. I can't even begin to image what those million people that voted for SRS are like. We need to face the fact we live in a country where 50% of the population is semiliterate, uninformed, and poisoned by the media outlets with nontransparent ownership structure so that we don't know who's financing them. When a person like that gets out to vote, I'm convinced they don't have the slightest clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without really knowing what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
2500|$|Among the Nazi leadership, the {{greatest}} {{interest in the}} idea of creating Muslim units under German command was shown by Heinrich Himmler, who viewed the Islamic world as a potential ally against the British Empire and regarded the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia as a 'ridiculous state'. Himmler had a romantic vision of Islam as a faith ‘fostering fearless soldiers’, and this probably {{played a significant role in}} his decision to raise three Muslim divisions under German leadership in the Balkans from Bosnian Muslims and Albanians: the 13th Handschar, the 21st Skanderbeg, and the [...] 23rd Kama (Shepherd's dagger). Riven by interethnic conflict, the region's Jewish, Croat, Roma, Serb and Muslim communities suffered huge losses of life, Bosnian Muslims losing around 85,000 from a genocidal Chetnik ethnic cleansing operations alone. The Muslims had three options: to join the Croatian Ustaše, [...] or the Yugoslav partisans, or to create local defense units. Following a tradition of service in the old Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian army, they chose an alliance with Germany, which promised them autonomy. Husseini, having been petitioned by the Bosnian Muslim leaders, was well informed of their plight. Dissatisfied with low enlistenment, Himmler [...] asked the mufti to intervene. Husseini negotiated, made several requests, mostly ignored by the SS, and conducted several visits to the area. His speeches and charismatic authority proved instrumental in improving enlistment notably. In one speech he declared that:Those lands suffering under the British and Bolshevist yoke impatiently await the moment when the Axis (powers) will emerge victorious. We must dedicate ourselves to unceasing struggle against Britain - that dungeon of peoples - and to the complete destruction of the British Empire. We must dedicate ourselves to unceasing struggle against Bolshevist Russia because communism is incompatible with Islam.' One SS officer reporting on impressions from the mufti's Sarajevo speech said Husseini was reserved about fighting Bolshevism, his main enemies being Jewish settlers in Palestine and the English. During a visit in July 1943 the Mufti said: [...] "The active cooperation of the world's 400 million Muslims with their loyal friends, the German, can be of decisive influence upon the outcome of the war. [...] You, my Bosnian Muslims, are the first Islamic division [...] serve as an example of the active collaboration....My enemy's enemy is my friend." [...] Himmler in addressing the unit on another occasion declared [...] "Germany [...] the Reich have been friends of Islam for the past two centuries, owing not to expediency but to friendly conviction. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> goals." ...|$|E
