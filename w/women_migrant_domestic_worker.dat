Case studies and themes were developed about the women's experiences of work life and how it connected to their programme participation. The findings revealed that the women had health problems that were related to their work, and they participated in programmes {{in order to better}} understand them. The women also experienced considerable isolation at work, and attended their programmes in order to socialise and meet other women like themselves. Additionally, the women wanted to learn how to better negotiate workplace texts, and, eventually, use their new-found knowledge and education to move into other occupations. The article ends with implications for practice and policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{figure of}} the <b>migrant</b> <b>woman</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>worker</b> has {{characterized}} the Filipino immigrant population in France {{for the last three}} decades. Empirical studies of Filipinos in France have also focused on this figure and consequently tend to overlook the other components of the Filipino population in this country. Here I attempt to shed light on the heterogeneity of this population by examining the case of Filipino women in ethnically “mixed” unions, i. e. those living in conjugal relationship with a non-Filipino partner. Semi-structured interviews and informal conversations were conducted with eleven migrant Filipinas to bring to light the factors that diversify the transnational practices of <b>migrant</b> <b>women.</b> Hence I explored not only their migration trajectories, but also their maintenance of varied ties with their country of origin. These women’s union with a non-Filipino partner provides them opportunities to realize their personal projects as well as their caregiving role to their family left behind. However, the intensity and character of their transnational activities appear to be influenced and differentiated by their social class belonging and by their family situation (notably whether or not they have children who remained in the Philippines) ...|$|R
40|$|For {{over four}} centuries {{indigenous}} populations in Latin America have experienced rural-to-urban labor migration {{to secure their}} personal and collective survival. Such {{has been the case}} of the Mapuche women of Chile, who as a poor marginalized minority residing in southern 2 ̆ 2 refuge zones, 2 ̆ 2 have found in urban, well-to-do households their means of survival. 2 ̆ 2 Mapuche <b>Migrant</b> <b>Women</b> in <b>Domestic</b> Work: A Portrait of Personal and Collective Survival 2 ̆ 2 is an historical and ethnographic account of the living and working experiences of thirteen women who escaped different levels of poverty in native Puerto Saavedra, Western bank of the Araucanian Region, by enrolling in the invisible and disregarded domestic service sector of Santiago, Chile 2 ̆ 7 s capital city. Through the use of audio-taped interviews, focus groups and participant observation conducted between 1994 and 1996 in the sending and the receiving communities among people directly or indirectly linked to the reality of Mapuche domestic labor migration, the study analyses the idiosyncratic motives and/or causes that led these <b>women</b> to become <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers,</b> the transitional adaptation processes/patterns they engaged in, the power relations and/or forms of control or discipline they faced and the various patterns of resistance and/or accommodation through which they navigated oppression in and outside the working environment. Through this analysis, and contrary to what is commonly believed, I contend that the institution of domestic service in Chile continues to be anchored in a colonial ideology that forces the migrants to secure their jobs by submitting themselves to coercive, uninterrupted and controlling disciplining targeted at their labor as well as their physical and mental make-up. I also contend that regardless of how docile the workers may appear in order to secure these jobs, they are not completely mute or passive, since {{at the same time that}} they show support for, and/or accommodation of domination, they also demonstrate, whether actively or passively, subconsciously or consciously, resistance to those in power. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon ethnographic {{research}} conducted in Singapore between September 2008 and October 2009 and over a decade of observation and experience as an expatriate woman. It explores the relationship between two <b>migrant</b> <b>women,</b> an expatriate <b>woman</b> and a <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>worker</b> (MDW), focusing on interrelated processes shaping migrant subjectivities. The relationship between between 'upper circuit' transnational elites and 'lower circuit' migrants {{is an area of}} transnationalism that has received little attention. Yet, expatriates and MDWs routinely live together. I consider how overlapping transnational fields impact how both groups of women deal with class, racial and cultural differences and how they negotiate versions of femininity in their domestic interactions. I argue that the women‘s dual migrant status renders visible coexisting and competing forms of power that are often overlooked in studies of domestic work. A crucial aspect of my research design is that I include the perspectives of both expatriate women and MDWs {{as well as those of}} expatriate men. Most studies of domestic work focus on either the employer‘s (usually female) or the employee‘s (usually female) viewpoint and overlook male influence on household dynamics and the shaping of domestic femininities. My approach allows for a richer analysis of how class, racial/ethnic and sexual positionings (among others) both motivate and constrain how individuals identify themselves vis-à-vis 'others' across national, racial, class and cultural divides. My findings are organised along four dimensions. First, I examine how shared migrant status is utilised by expatriate women and MDWs in their respective distance-making processes. Second, I explain how through performing domestic labour both groups of women are 'doing' different versions of femininity that are simultaneously accomplishments of class and racial identities. Third, I focus on how sexualised and racialised discourses about migrant women‘s bodies permeate expatriate women‘s and MDWs‘ relationships. Finally, I link my study of the micro-politics of migrant women‘s relationships with the larger context of increasing transnational migration and globalisation...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] This {{report is}} based on the {{findings}} of research conducted in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain, as part of project on “integration of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> in Europe”, implemented by the ILO and its partners with the financial support of the European Union. Data suggest that <b>women</b> <b>migrants</b> are often facing the greatest integration challenges, but the specific situation of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> in Europe remains often under- researched and little understood. Evidence-based, action-oriented research is key to producing policies that will address the needs of European labour markets, and critical to expanding the opportunities for successful integration of this important and growing segment of the population. In light of this, the current research aims: (a) to explore social, economic, and institutional factors affecting life and working conditions of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> in Europe; and (b) to identify challenges and practical ways public services, trade unions, employers and other social actors can support their improvement. The ambition is to better understand integration dynamics by analysing the experiences and activities of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> themselves in countries of destination, taking into account their voices and experiences as a main source of information...|$|R

40|$|The plights of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> from {{historical}} and legal perspective {{appear to be}} internationally recognised. However, the setback lies {{with the lack of}} agreement on how best to deal with the problem. This paper examines the human rights protection for <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> from international and national perspectives and finds that <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> are barely protected. This group of workers continues to experience a series of human rights violation such as discrimination, criminalisation, and exploitation; with little or no means of redress. The ‘’international bill of rights’’ appear to provide some support for <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> but its enforcement, as well as the enforcement of all other human rights instruments is problematic due to inadequate support at the national level. The adoption of the 189 th Labour Convention in June 2011 has been praised as a landmark victory for <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> even though its effect is too soon to be called. However, considering that the United Kingdom did not support this Convention, its benefit for <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> in the country is currently doubtful. Further, the current changes to the United Kingdom immigration rules puts the future of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> (especially the new migrants) into a complete state of disarray. In addition, <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> in diplomatic households remain at the mercy of their employers’ immunity.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{contribution}} a trade union can make to organizing the informal sector in Malaysia, focusing more specifically on the <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>worker</b> industry. Based on a three month fieldwork, an analysis {{has been made of}} the self-organization by <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> as well as labour organizations and affiliated NGOs. Data shows that there are numerous challenges and constraints ahead for establishing a trade union for this group of female <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Domestic</b> work in Malaysia has been taken up by <b>migrant</b> <b>women</b> from neighbouring countries who have stepped into the void in the households of Malaysian women, who have increasingly joined the public workforce. However, domestic work is not included as work in Malaysian labour laws and <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> are therefore described as servants rather than workers. Together with their migrant status, these <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> enjoy no social security and protection. Negative perceptions on domestic work and its workers have rooted in Malaysian society that have been shaped by colonial history, ethnic diversity, the media and the Malaysian government’s favouritism of Malaysian citizens. These elements pose challenges that a trade union is able to overcome with the help of innovative strategies. However, organizing <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> is constrained by the limited time, mobility and knowledge that the workers have. The slow reform and the restrictions on the trade union movement by the authoritarian state are obstructing the formation of a trade union for <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers,</b> leaving current state of affairs of maltreatment and poor working conditions unrecognized and unanswered. Despite these obstructions, a trade union can contribute. It requires innovative strategies in creating awareness in Malaysian society, involvement of the workers in union activities, trade unions close national and transnational partnerships with other unions, employers and recruitment agencies in the industry...|$|R
5000|$|Beyond {{these public}} mobilizations and {{lobbying}} efforts for change, awareness raising {{has also been}} used as a strategy, serving in some cases to transform the public view on <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> with the hope of stigmatizing abuse against [...] and encouraging respect toward <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> at the national level. Educational efforts have also been used to inform women of their rights in countries where laws outlining employers’ obligations do exist. Due to the difficulties in mobilizing <b>domestic</b> <b>workers,</b> initiatives to raise awareness and inform migrant workers of their rights has not always been undertaken in institutionalized manners, but rather through informal means, such as planned encounters in public spaces that <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> are known to frequent.|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{work has}} become {{increasingly}} commoditized in the global economy. <b>Migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 remittances constitute {{a rich source of}} revenues for their countries of origin, while their labor ameliorates the “care deficit” experienced in wealthier countries of destination. Despite the importance of their work, <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> {{are some of the most}} exploited workers in the world. They are often discriminated against based on their gender, class, race, nationality, and immigration status, and they are excluded from labor law protections in most countries of destination. This essay examines some of the underlying reasons for this mistreatment and neglect.

50|$|In the Western world, the {{employment}} of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> differs from the predominant hiring and recruiting trends in the East. In Europe, migration has followed a pattern from East to West, that is from Eastern Europe to Western, Southern and Northern Europe and from South to North, from Latin America, Asia and Africa to the EU countries. The demand for <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> has been credited to the welfare system of these countries. In order to enable female nationals to ‘reconcile’ care work and a working life, some European states have installed a quota system for the recruitment of <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> (Spain, Italy, Greece), which allows employers to recruit workers from abroad under specific criteria, or they have opened their borders to these workers (Britain and Ireland with the <b>domestic</b> <b>worker</b> visa). Others, such as Germany, the Nordic States, and the Netherlands, have hardly acknowledged the need for <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers,</b> let alone included this need in their managed migration policies. United States and Canada have adopted migrant programs such as Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 IRCA and Live-In Caregiver program, respectively, {{in order to facilitate}} {{the employment}} of <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regardless {{of their}} country of employment, <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> {{experience}} social isolation from the local community, {{as well as from}} their home community, resulting from the move to a different country. Since they typically leave their families behind, <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> are separated physically from their social network, including their children and close relatives, which contributes to their social isolation. The language and cultural barriers further complicate this transition and make it difficult for these workers to connect with the local population. Due to the language barrier, <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> know little to nothing about the local laws to protect themselves from abuse in the work place. This prevents them from raising awareness about their working conditions and from forming collective action.|$|R
5000|$|Due to poor - in {{many cases}} none - regulation, <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> face “excessive hours, {{physical}} and sexual abuse, forced labor and confinement.” [...] In many countries, this also includes foregoing wages and paying debt bondage. [...] Bonded labor occurs when the <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>worker</b> is required to pay off transportation and recruitment costs, as well as agent commission fees. [...] According to the ILO, 20.9 million persons work as forced labor in the world, of which domestic work represents the biggest proportion, affecting <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> around the world.

5000|$|<b>Migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers,</b> due to {{the nature}} of their work and to their status as migrants, or {{irregular}} migrants, are subject to a number of challenges that prevent collective action and claims for rights. The same factors that make <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> vulnerable to abuse [...] also prevent them from developing social networks [...] and coordinating action. Moreover, <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> more generally cannot employ tactics used by other workers in organizations, such as strike action, if they live in their employer’s home.|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} for <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> in Lebanon is grim, as the circumstances for {{them are not}} improving; the <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> {{have been subjected to}} violations of their freedom of movement and their right to residency. In early 2014, the general security began deporting children of migrant workers with one or both of their parents. The justification for this move was that the migrants were in Lebanon to work and not create families, it is worthy to note that the implementation of these deportations had been put on hold after pressure from civil society organisations like Insan. By the summer of 2015, the decision to expel <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> and their children had been overturned. However, things did not get better for the <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> workers; they now had to deal with tighter control over residency permits. The general security which is the body legally mandated to deal with foreign workers has refused to re-grant some workers their permits on the grounds of refusing to reside with their employees. Despite the fact that the general security exercises force on <b>migrant</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> and their presence in the country, this is in fact in violation with the Lebanese legal international commitment, constitution and national laws.|$|R
50|$|In the Arab countries, recruiters match <b>domestic</b> <b>workers</b> {{with their}} {{employers}} through the kafala system or sponsorship system.
