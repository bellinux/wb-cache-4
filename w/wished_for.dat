Two studies of a vaccine found it was 60% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases. This is less than <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> by some.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} a musical number in which the members of Quahog sing about what they want <b>for</b> Christmas. Peter <b>wishes</b> to have actress and models Jessica Biel and Megan Fox. He also wishes {{to have lunch with}} Michael Landon's ghost and wants twelve kegs of beer. Lois wishes to visit the Spanish coasts, and [...] "Mexico, [...] with two black guys and some blow". Chris <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> Jennifer Garner and Meg <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> a Lexus. The neighbors of Quahog also <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> gifts: Herbert <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> a drummer boy (there is a picture of singer Nick Jonas on the wall while he <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> this), Mayor Adam West <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> a tinkertoy, Carl <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> a Blu-ray version of The Wiz and Consuela <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> more Lemon Pledge. Continuing with the song, Jillian Russell <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> Easter eggs, Joe <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> one day when kids don't stare at him, Bonnie wants platinum-plated silverware, Quagmire wants [...] "Japanese girls of no restraint" [...] to choke him and then whip him and Mort (who is Jewish) says he will sue if they put a Christmas tree in the airport.

5|$|Born in Nordhausen, Germany to John Wolfgang Horn and Sophia Dorothea Shenaman, Charles Frederick Horn was {{the third}} of their four children. According to the memoirs of Charles Frederick's son, Charles Edward Horn, John Wolfgang <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> his son to become a surveyor. Horn would often furtively {{practice}} music instead; when his father found out, he destroyed the family's clavichord {{in the hopes of}} preventing his son from becoming distracted from his studies. This, though, did not dissuade Horn from taking music lessons from Nordhausen organist Christoph Gottlieb Schröter.|$|E
5|$|Day <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> {{the girls}} to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Dubček's reforms {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} the press, and political commentary was allowed {{for the first time}} in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E

30|$|Of {{the three}} factors, only factor 1 shows {{significant}} differences between the groups which varyingly strong <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS (N =  410): Patients with increasing <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS more often react internal.|$|R
30|$|No {{difference}} was shown {{between gender and}} <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS in this survey. Family status on the contrary was important: widowed, divorced and separate as well as single patients mentioned a stronger <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS than those bound to families. Older patients resigned more often than younger ones. Already discussed in literature patients with strong <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> CRS stated a loss of income more often than those without <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS [7, 36, 37]. The importance of this aspect is emphasized {{by the fact that}} loss of income got incorporated in the questionnaire by Rogers [38].|$|R
5|$|European club {{football}} competitions {{began in}} the mid-1950s. Though Manchester City were moderately successful domestically in this period, the club did not play in Europe. City were not invited {{to play in the}} Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup did not begin until 1960. When eight players from neighbours Manchester United lost their lives in the Munich air disaster when returning from a European Cup match in February 1958, UEFA <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> City to take United's place in the competition. City rejected the idea out of hand.|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian {{army had}} {{proceeded}} to burn and sack the Boeotian cities {{which had not}} surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee {{the security of the}} Peloponnese. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking {{a turning point in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{elections}} for the Chamber of Deputies returned unfavourable results for Talleyrand. The ministry <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> moderate deputies, but the electorate voted almost exclusively for ultra-royalists, resulting in the so-called Chambre introuvable. The Duchess of Angoulême and the Count of Artois pressured King Louis for the dismissal of his obsolete ministry. Talleyrand tendered his resignation on 20 September. Louis XVIII chose the Duke of Richelieu to be his new Prime Minister. Richelieu was chosen because he was accepted by Louis's family and the reactionary Chamber of Deputies.|$|E

30|$|It {{was asked}} for normal oral diet as countercheck which {{reflects}} {{the satisfaction of}} patients not <b>wishing</b> <b>for</b> CRS. Scarring of the face and neck is the main trigger (F =  33, 779; p <  0.001) of <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> further CRS. Therefrom, impairments of the facial muscles lead to dropped mouth corners, and hence, dripping of saliva or drinks is the most important. If facial muscles are unaffected (F =  48, 026 in control group), the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS is much more seldom. Hypaesthesia of the lower lip is also meaningful emphasized by the control group with significantly lower numbers of <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS (p <  0.001). Same is valid for patients without facial or cervical pain (F =  12, 378).|$|R
5|$|Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934. Its {{principal}} purposes were coordination of joint {{foreign policy and}} mutual international diplomatic support; {{it was not a}} military alliance. In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius was outside the scope of the Entente, but they <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region. Latvia attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E
5|$|Smith asked Walls {{for details}} of his plan ("Operation Quartz") for using force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl {{believed}} that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that {{it was already too}} late, and while the others <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> some move, they were forced to concede to this view.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{support of}} the Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (who was also Prime Minister of the United Kingdom then), for an Anglican King's College London and the Roman Catholic Relief Act, which was {{to lead to the}} granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics, was challenged by George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea, in early 1829. Winchilsea and his supporters <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> King's to be subject to the Test Acts, like the universities of Oxford, where only members of the Church of England could matriculate, and Cambridge, where non-Anglicans could matriculate but not graduate, but this was not Wellington's intent.|$|E
30|$|Here too, minor <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS {{is related}} to minor hedonism. Hence, if the value for hedonism increases, so does the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS. Patient numbers in higher factor values are quiet small. In severe illnesses, {{thoughts}} of life enjoyment are seldom.|$|R

5|$|A Norman medieval chronicler {{claimed that}} Robert {{travelled}} to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> {{him to become}} his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, and whether he actually made it, {{have been the subject}} of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{sought the}} {{abolition}} of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians, which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. Chamberlain's first step in the direction of abolition was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates, as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment. Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill, who showed him the manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis. Churchill confided that he would have <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> two more years to revise the manuscript; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours—with a pair of scissors.|$|E
5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been excluded, and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish to be the ones to do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E

Gilkeson tendered an offer to C.H. Hill, then an instructor at the Maryland School for the Deaf, and upon Gilkeson's return to Romney he recommended Hill and resigned from his post as principal. Hill was subsequently appointed by the Board to fill the position. While the Board of Regents was pleased with Gilkeson's performance as principal and <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> him to stay on in the position, but he preferred {{to return to his}} professional law and political career in the end.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) is {{recruiting}} {{for the new}} all-girl show choir {{directed by}} Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), and asks Santana (Naya Rivera)—a member of the school's existing glee club, New Directions—to join. Santana balks at leaving Brittany behind, and when she and Brittany {{go out on a}} dinner date, Santana tries to recruit her, but Brittany is unwilling to leave her New Directions friends. She tells Santana of Rory's supposed magical powers, and Santana later coerces Rory into telling Brittany that Santana has <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> her to join Shelby's glee club. Brittany believes she must obey that wish, but her third wish is that doing so does not hurt anybody's feelings. New Directions co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) tries to persuade Brittany not to leave: he tells her that leprechauns are not real and that she is being stupid. Brittany, insulted, quits anyway.|$|E

Returning to San Francisco in 1919, Pflueger once again focused on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who now <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> a further doubling in size, extending their Stockton Street frontage 140 feet to California Street, and adding a seventh floor. A massive new entrance incorporating 17 Ionic columns was erected, topped by a pediment displaying a tableau carved by Armenian sculptor Haig Patigian. The Neoclassic-style project was completed in 1920. In 1984, the building was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 167.|$|E
