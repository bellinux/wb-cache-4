25|$|INTERVIEWER: Suppose {{someone called}} {{you and said}} there was a kid, {{nineteen}} or twenty years old, who has been a very good boy, {{but all of a sudden}} this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would you do something about it. How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E
500|$|On July1, 1936, premier Mitch Hepburn {{attended}} a ceremony {{in front of}} the Rainy Lake Hotel in Fort Frances. On a rainy afternoon, at 5:30p.m., Peter Heenan handed Hepburn a pair of scissors with which to cut the ribbon crossing the road and declare the highway open. Hepburn, addressing the crowd that was gathered, asked [...] "What would you say if we call it the Heenan Highway, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that?". The crowd cheered and Hepburn cut the ribbon.|$|E
500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, {{so it would be}} child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo and on your support for organising the start? ...|$|E
6000|$|F.--If you did {{not wish}} to think of the pocopo, and {{speaking}} of man <b>would</b> make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not speak of man, <b>would</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|R

500|$|Kurtzman {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Hefner and Playboy executive editor Ray Russell, who was interested in Kurtzman's idea of a comic strip suitable for the magazine's audience and suggested [...] "satire... as an excuse or rationale for a slick magazine to be publishing a comic strip." [...] Although single-panel cartoons were an established part of the magazine, a comic strip was unprecedented {{and had to be}} justified. Kurtzman submitted some Goodman Beaver strips and was surprised to receive a favorable response from Hefner, who liked the [...] "fresh and eager" [...] character. He especially enjoyed [...] "Goodman Goes Playboy", which featured a boisterous romp in Hefner's mansion. Hefner nevertheless insisted that the material was not right for his magazine, but requested an explanation of the character with a suggestion: [...] "Maybe there is a way of launching a similar series... that can somehow be related to Playboy". Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver [...] "could be foolish {{and at the same time}} wise," [...] and that he [...] "innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good." [...] He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a girl character... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?" [...] Six weeks later Hefner replied, [...] "I think your notion of doing a Goodman Beaver strip of two, three, or four pages, but using a sexy girl... is a bull's eye. We can run it every issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 9, 1948, Paige {{became the}} oldest man ever to {{debut in the}} major leagues, {{at the age of}} 42 years and two days. When asked about his age, he would reply [...] "If someone asked you how old you were and you didn't know your age, how old <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you were?" [...] With the St. Louis Browns beating the Indians 4–1 {{in the bottom of the}} fourth inning, Boudreau pulled his {{starting}} pitcher, Bob Lemon, and sent Paige in. Paige, not knowing the signs and not wanting to confuse his catcher, pitched cautiously. Chuck Stevens lined a ball left field for a single. Jerry Priddy bunted Stevens over to second. Up next was Whitey Platt, and Paige decided to take command. He threw an overhand pitch for a strike and one sidearm for another strike. Paige then threw his [...] "Hesitation Pitch" [...] (see [...] "pitching style" [...] section below), which surprised Platt so much that he threw his bat 40 feet up the third base line. Browns manager Zack Taylor bolted from the dugout to talk to umpire Bill McGowan about the pitch, claiming it was a balk, but McGowan let it stand as a strike. Paige then got Al Zarilla to fly out to end the inning. The next inning, he gave up a leadoff single, but with his catcher having simplified his signals, Paige got the next batter to hit into a double play, followed by a pop fly. Larry Doby pinch-hit for Paige the following inning.|$|E

6000|$|The {{other day}} the {{children}} were projecting a purchase, Livy and I to furnish the money--a dollar and a half. Jean discouraged the idea. She said: [...] "We haven't got any money.

What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a man who looked at some decayed, blind, toothless, pock-marked Cleopatra, and said: [...] "What matchless beauty! What soul! What expression!" [...] What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a man who gazed upon a dingy, foggy sunset, and said: [...] "What sublimity! What feeling! What richness of coloring!"

60|$|Every evening these countrymen of Luther and Melancthon {{gathered}} on the forecastle to sing and pray.
