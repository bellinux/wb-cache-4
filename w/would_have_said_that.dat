500|$|Moreau and Jourdan faced similar difficulties. Jourdan {{continued}} in his single-minded pursuit of Wartensleben, and Moreau continued his single-minded pursuit of Charles, and Moreau in particular penetrated deep into Bavaria. The French armies drew {{further and further}} away from the Rhine, and from each other. Napoleon later wrote of Moreau's actions, [...] "One <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was ignorant that a French army existed on his left". Historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge asserted that the combined army [...] "could have crushed the Austrians".|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, some members of Sonic Team visited Hong Kong shortly before the {{transfer}} of British sovereignty, in hopes of finding inspiration for the game's stages. Some staff also travelled to Universal Studios in California to experience the Backdraft attraction to learn how to generate a similar sensation in the game. The team also visited a special firefighting event in Tokyo where they witnessed robots putting out fires, and were surprised to see how it compared to their image of the game's futuristic setting. Naka recalled that the robot had special infrared sensors and a camera which could see through fires, and was impressed by their techniques. According to Naka, the team did not ask for advice from professional firefighters during development, partly due to the concern that their game would not be well received, as Naka thought they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> real firefighting [...] "wasn't that simple". At the Tokyo Games Show, a real firefighter, however, did comment that the character's costumes were too thin. Naka reflected that if they had made any of game elements highly realistic, the contrast between those elements and the clearly fictional elements would have been exaggerated.|$|E
500|$|Critics mostly {{reacted with}} acclaim for the mash-up of [...] "I Feel Pretty / Unpretty". Gonzalez gave the {{performance}} an [...] "A" [...] and commented: [...] "While {{part of me}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> pairing Rachel and Quinn for a duet would vocally be like putting a pit bull in a cage match with a Maltipoo, it actually worked! There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone." [...] All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said it was beautiful, and noted that [...] "the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon {{felt that it was}} [...] "unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting", and noted that it was [...] "yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups." [...] Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an [...] "A", and said that it was a [...] "vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners." [...] Flandez commented that the song [...] "floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up that reminds us of what Glee is at its heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the battle, Saigō {{was badly}} {{injured in the}} hip. [...] However, the exact manner of his death is unknown. The {{accounts}} of his subordinates claim either that {{he stood up and}} committed seppuku after his injury or that he requested that the comrade Beppu Shinsuke assist his suicide. In debate, some scholars have suggested that neither is the case and that Saigō may have gone into shock following his wound, losing his ability to speak. Several comrades, upon seeing him in this state, would have severed his head, assisting him in the warrior's suicide they knew he would have wished. Later, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he committed seppuku to preserve his status as a true samurai.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the lead}} authors, Dennis L. Hartmann, {{subsequently}} said; [...] "Going into the IPCC this time, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> well, the trend over a 15-year record is not really very meaningful, because of the natural interannual variability of the climate system. But as the IPCC evolved, it {{became more and more}} of a public issue, so we felt we had to say something about it, even though from an observational perspective, it's not a very reliable measure of long-term warming." [...] He said [...] "the apparent reduction in the observed warming rate" [...] was [...] "interesting on purely scientific grounds, but it does not have a huge impact on the scientific assessment and does not alter the basic facts." [...] Research cited in the report had to be published by 15 March, excluding work such as a paper by NCAR scientists including Kevin E. Trenberth indicating that increased heat was going into ocean depths.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{discussed}} why, in {{the words}} of [...] God spoke to Moses [...] "in wilderness." [...] Rava taught that when people open themselves to everyone like a wilderness, God gives them the Torah. Similarly, a Midrash taught that those who do not throw themselves open to all like a wilderness cannot acquire wisdom and Torah. The Sages inferred from [...] that the Torah was given to the accompaniment of fire, water, and wilderness. And the giving of the Torah was marked by these three features to show that as these are free to all people, so are the words of the Torah; as [...] states, [...] "everyone who thirsts, come for water." [...] Another Midrash taught that if the Torah had been given to the Israelites in the land of Israel, the tribe in whose territory it was given <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it had a prior claim to the Torah, so God gave it in the wilderness, so that all should have an equal claim to it. Another Midrash taught that as people neither sow nor till the wilderness, so those who accept the yoke of the Torah are relieved of the yoke of earning a living; and as the wilderness does not yield any taxes from crops, so scholars are free in this world. And another Midrash taught that the Torah was given in the wilderness because they preserve the Torah who keep themselves separate like a wilderness.|$|E

2500|$|Moreau {{deserved}} {{criticism for}} spreading his forces too widely {{but he can}} be credited for keeping his composure despite the defeat of Duhesme. But Moreau now fell into a fatal strategic error. Charles entertained a desire to combine forces with Wartensleben {{at the earliest opportunity}} in order to defeat Jourdan's army. When Charles withdrew to the south bank of the Danube, he left Moreau free to stay on the north bank and join with Jourdan. Charles hoped to lure his opponent onto the south bank which would take Moreau farther away from Jourdan. In fact, Moreau did not begin to advance until 14 August and then he headed for the Danube crossings. Meanwhile, Charles retreated rapidly, increasing the distance between his army and Moreau, but also giving himself more room to maneuver. On 18 and 19 August Moreau's army finally crossed to the south bank of the Danube. But on the 17th the archduke made a crucial strategic move. Leaving Latour with 30,288 troops plus Condé's 5,000-6,000 men, Charles and 28,000 troops recrossed to the north bank, heading for a rendezvous with Wartensleben. Ignoring this move, Moreau moved steadily to the east on the south bank of the Danube. Napoleon later wrote of Moreau, [...] "One <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was ignorant that a French army existed on his left". The next actions were the Battle of Amberg and the Battle of Friedberg, both on 24 August 1796.|$|E
