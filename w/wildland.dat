5|$|A {{wildfire}} or <b>wildland</b> fire is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation {{that occurs}} in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the <b>wildland</b> fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as <b>wildland</b> fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has <b>wildland</b> fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Wildlands</b> Project {{seeks to}} create a {{connected}} system of protected areas across North America that will ensure the survival of all native species, including top predators and wideranging species, {{in the context of}} fully functioning ecosystems. Core protected areas are designated based on the biological needs of key species and the requirements of critical ecological processes. To work they must have, or will be restored to have, those attributes traditionally ascribed to wilderness. Some critics argue that The <b>Wildlands</b> Project model is inapplicable {{to other parts of the}} world, especially the developing world. The inapplicability is based on nonbiological considerations. The applicability of <b>Wildlands</b> type conservation outside of North America is examined in light of largescale conservation work in Latin America and Asia. In both regions, conservation efforts similar to those of The <b>Wildlands</b> Project are underway and show promise. There are important differences, but the similarities are significant enough to suggest the approach can be applied. The similarities between conservation work in North America, Latin America, and Asia is attributable in some cases to <b>Wildlands</b> Project influence. In other cases, similarities are due to similar strategies emerging from similar conditions leading to species loss...|$|R
