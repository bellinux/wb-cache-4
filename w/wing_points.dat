2500|$|Both types were corrugated-aluminium-skinned in the Junkers style. [...] The high wings were semi-cantilevers, {{unsupported}} {{apart from}} pairs of parallel struts from the fuselage bottom {{edge to the}} wing close to the fuselage. The main legs of the fixed, tailwheel undercarriage were attached at the same <b>wing</b> <b>points</b> as the struts and joined laterally by inverted V bracing. [...] The fuselage was flat-sided, with wide windows to the passenger cabin under the wing. [...] This was accessed via a portside door, aft {{of which was a}} smaller door into a baggage compartment. The two crew members sat in a cabin in front of the wings, accessed by a rooftop hatch. [...] The tail was conventional, with a braced tailplane.|$|E
2500|$|The Philippine Airlines logo {{has gone}} under four incarnations {{in the entire}} length of its operations.

50|$|The {{ground plan}} of Het Strijkijzer has an L-shape, with the {{slightly}} longer <b>wing</b> <b>pointing</b> north, and the shorter <b>wing</b> <b>pointing</b> east, the corner between them pointing south-west, {{in the direction}} of the Hollands Spoor railway station. The corners of the triangle are rounded, and each has its own lobby, pair of lifts, and staircase. The southern entrance, at the end of the longer wing, is for the residents of the studio flats. The western entrance, at the end of the shorter wing, is for the residents of the luxury flats, and the third entrance is for visitors of the panoramic terrace; the lifts go straight from the lobby to the 42nd floor.|$|R

50|$|A pylon turn is {{a flight}} {{maneuver}} {{in which an}} aircraft banks into a circular turn, {{in such a way}} that an imaginary line projecting straight out the side of the aircraft (nominally the <b>wing)</b> <b>points</b> to a fixed point on the ground. The maneuver originated early in the 20th century in air racing.|$|E
5000|$|In the May 1966 {{issue of}} The Burlington Magazine, Howard Saalman wrote that [...] "the {{language}} {{of the details of}} the Ex-Dormitory and the Ex-Library <b>wing</b> <b>points</b> to Michelozzo. If Vasari is right and Michelozzo did work at Santa Croce (and {{there is no reason to}} doubt it in spite of the lack of documentation) then Michelozzo and his circle probably handled the entire operation as at San Marco, SS. Annunziata and elsewhere." ...|$|E
5000|$|For some Enneagram theorists {{the lines}} {{connecting}} the points add further {{meaning to the}} {{information provided by the}} descriptions of the types. Sometimes called the [...] "security" [...] and [...] "stress" [...] points, or points of [...] "integration" [...] and [...] "disintegration", some theorists believe that these connected points also contribute to a person's overall personality. From this viewpoint, therefore, there are at least four other points that can affect a person's overall personality; the two points connected by the lines to the core type and the two <b>wing</b> <b>points.</b> These ideas, however, have now largely been rejected or modified by most Enneagram teachers, including Claudio Naranjo who first developed them.|$|E

50|$|Attached {{immediately}} {{behind the}} single open cockpit headrest at the forward wing spar, the nacelle extended rearwards {{only to the}} wing trailing edge, suspended from an inverted V pair of struts to the rear spar. A landing skid extended {{over most of the}} length of the nacelle. Aft of the nacelle, the fuselage was an uncovered converging Warren girder structure carrying the tail surfaces and braced laterally by wires to the mid-span <b>wing</b> <b>points.</b> The fin was very small but carried an almost rectangular rudder which extended to the fuselage keel via a cut-out in the elevators. The tailplane was straight tapered, with a swept leading edge. A wire tail bumper completed the undercarriage.|$|E

50|$|The {{spiral dive}} {{is the most}} rapid form of {{controlled}} fast descent; an aggressive spiral dive can achieve a sink rate of 25 m/s. This maneuver halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes {{on one side and}} shifts his weight onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the <b>wing</b> <b>points</b> directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this maneuver by slowly releasing the inner brake, shifting his weight to the outer side and braking on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the spiral dive gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.|$|E
50|$|The wing had a two-spar fabric covered {{structure}} and was completely rectangular in plan. Ailerons occupied approximately ⅓ {{of the outer}} trailing edge. The wing was mounted on the horizontal upper beam of the three-bay fuselage Warren girder. The lower beam, angled slightly upwards rearwards, carried the pilot's seat and controls at its forward end. On each side V-shaped lift struts linked the upper fuselage structure to the two wing spars at about ¼ span. Pairs of landing wires ran from a longitudinally-orientated inverted V-shaped pylon above {{the centre of the}} upper wing to the two spars near the inboard edge of the aileron. Similarly arranged flying wires ran from the same <b>wing</b> <b>points</b> to the keel. Bracing wires from the rear spar, at the same point as the flying wires, were anchored to the lower rear corner of the flat fuselage girder to limit sideways flexing.|$|E
