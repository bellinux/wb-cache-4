500|$|Rihanna's voice spans one-and-a-half octaves in [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", from F3 to C5, and her vocal has a [...] "silky", [...] "seductive" [...] tone. In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} her feel like the only girl in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you {{to make me feel}} like I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>enter,</b> you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her hair out of the castle for just any man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly not someone who isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E

2500|$|New {{multiplayer}} modes {{are added}} to the already existing modes, including [...] "story-oriented quests", as well as a much requested Capture the Flag mode. Some multiplayer maps are based in the island of Rhodes. Among the new additions is a new multiplayer mode— Deathmatch— which differs from the previous multiplayer gameplay in that there is no compass pointing toward your assigned target, rather, there is a box in the top right of the screen where your current target is displayed, which glows blue <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>enter</b> the line of sight of your target. There is also Simple Deathmatch, which also removes the abilities and perks from the players.|$|E

When you go to the hospital, you start to see the same people. [...] we don’t want people suddenly going, [...] "Wait, is that Matt Murdock that’s walking down the street?" [...] Because that’s going to feel odd, and in a weird way feel false." [...] On existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, [...] "Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil. We exist in a cinematic universe, [...] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they’re very different… That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what’s come before? And the answer is no." ...|$|E
