500|$|Perhaps {{the marked}} {{signing of the}} summer was defender Sol Campbell, who moved from rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a Bosman ruling. The player's wage demands seemed to have {{extinguished}} Arsenal's chances of signing the player at one point. Campbell was unveiled at a midday news conference on 3 July 2001, which journalists [...] "presumed had been called to announce goalkeeper Richard Wright's arrival from Ipswich." [...] Wenger described Campbell as the [...] "best", adding: [...] "I felt we could not compete on financial basis with the top clubs but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> him a football challenge." ...|$|E

60|$|The same. Addison. But before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> {{the word}} [to retreat], the trainbands, taking {{advantage}} of our delay, fled first.--Swift. An argument for a standing army.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't fret yourself, my son. We've {{bought the}} gun all right; an' {{the next time}} we meet, you can hand it over. I wish our pile had been bigger so's <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> twenty, 'cause a kid like you deserves it." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{thought of}} it ourselves, and with {{mounting}} exasperation. When we reflected that he would probably have put it into his paper, and when we reflected that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> so much more color to our essay, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not endure it. [...] "Well, good-day," [...] we said, coldly; [...] "we are going down this way." ...|$|R
30|$|As such, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> a clear {{statement}} about the binding factors involved. We propose that many more factors apart from mannan- and glucan content, such as cell wall structure, strain diversity, structural diversity, structural surroundings, and non-specific interactions play important roles in pathogen immobilization.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Travers {{rose and}} moved quickly round the table. [...] "Can we give {{anything}} to this--this Daman or these other men? <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> them more than they could think of asking. I--my husband. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never meant}} it. I tried to act for the best. She was spoken to, {{by myself and}} others, but nobody could make any impression, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>give</b> her notice to go at the harvest holidays. She took it with her usual grand air--' ...|$|R
5000|$|On 23 February 2010 the Argentine striker {{left after}} two seasons Kansas City Wizards. [...] "We {{would have liked}} to have Claudio back in 2010, but {{unfortunately}} it became clear early in the contract negotiations that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> him what he desired," [...] Wizards Manager Peter Vermes said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh DEAR!' said Mrs Milvey, 'I am SO sorry! Mr Rokesmith took SUCH an {{interest}} in Lizzie Hexam, when we were there before. And if we had ONLY known of his face, <b>we</b> <b>COULD</b> have <b>given</b> him something that would have kept it down long enough for so SHORT a purpose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'May {{you never}} repent your devotion to our house!' said Sir Ratcliffe, rising from his seat. 'Time was <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> them who served us {{something}} better than thanks; but, at any rate, these come from the heart.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{think of}} it, {{but not just}} now. You {{remember}} Irene? I {{want you to come}} with me and see her. Soames is after her again. She might be safer if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> her asylum somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not, my dear. Nothing I {{can assure}} you is less probable. But still, Mr. Slope {{may be useful in}} finding how the wind blows, and I really thought that if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> {{something}} else as good to the Quiverfuls--" ...|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> now <b>give</b> {{explicit}} {{conditions for}} symmetry of A(U) {{in terms of}} the boundary conditions (2.7).

In order to avoid duplication we will therefore postpone deriving these explicit conditions to the next section.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, mother, {{that may}} be; but I bethink me now {{of two or}} three times when means have been wanting for the {{relieving}} of the poor, and the ransoming of captives, and the support of apostles, when we have said that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say," [...] {{said the}} Captain of the Archangels, {{trotting}} up, [...] "are you hurt, Lutyens? We'll wait {{if you care}} {{to put in a}} substitute.

60|$|Our {{drawback}} is, dear Miss Blagden, that we {{have not}} room to take you in. So sorry we both are indeed. Write and tell me whether you have decided about Vallombrosa. I hope we shall see much of you still at Florence, if not here. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> you everything here except a bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{whole story}} {{would have to}} come out," [...] said Tredgold, sharply. [...] "Verdict: served them right. Once we had got the {{treasure}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> Captain Bowers his share, or more than his share, {{and it would have been}} all right. As it is, nobody must know that we went for it." ...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The axiom of choice, {{guarantees}} that all set could be well-ordered, in particular linearly ordered. But the proof {{in this case}} was not effective, that was to say, non constructive. It was natural to ask if there was mathematics in which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>given</b> a more constructive proof. Approach: We work in the Nelsonâs IST which was an extension of ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice). In the theory of IST there were two primitive symbols st, â and the axioms of ZFC together with three axiom schemes which we call the Transfer principle (T), the principle of Idealization (I) and the principle of Standardization (S). Results: In the framework of IST <b>we</b> <b>could</b> construct, without the use of the choice axiom, a total order on every set. Conclusion: The Internal Set Theory provides a positive answer to our question...|$|R
60|$|During {{all this}} while {{we had the}} enemy's fleets in fairly good view, for the vessels {{appeared}} to be to the northward of New Point; but, {{as a matter of}} course, it could be of little benefit to the commodore to know how many vessels there were, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> him any idea of their weight of metal.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} {{fortunate}} indeed, sir. Even if two came in together <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> a good account of them, for as the palisade is mostly on higher ground than the huts, we should {{only have to}} slue the guns round and give them such a warm welcome that they would probably haul down their flags at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{read that}} with greater power here than to me," [...] said Helen. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> {{it the same}} unity and sweep of {{expression}} as we act it." [...] She addressed the company in her calm, clear voice: [...] "I hope you will all observe carefully Mr. Douglass's reading. He is giving us most valuable advice in every inflection." ...|$|E
60|$|He'd {{been saving}} up {{for years to}} get married, and all the advice <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> 'im didn't 'ave any effect.

60|$|We {{talked the}} matter over in serious {{conclave}} {{in the orchard}} that evening. We were all rather short of hard cash, having devoted most of our spare means to the school library fund. But the general consensus of opinion was that we must have the picture, no matter what pecuniary sacrifices were involved. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> each <b>give</b> about seven cents we would have the amount. Peter <b>could</b> only <b>give</b> four, but Dan gave eleven, which squared matters.|$|R
6000|$|This flattered Verrian, but {{he would}} not allow its reasonableness. He took a gulp of coffee before saying, uncandidly, [...] "I can't make out what you're driving at, mother. But, fortunately, there's no hurry about your meaning. The thing's in the only shape <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>give</b> it, and I am satisfied to leave it in Armiger's hands. I'm certain he will deal wisely with it-and kindly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Griff {{proposed}} {{cards to}} drive away fancies, especially as the sounds were beginning; but though we generally yielded to him <b>we</b> <b>COULD</b> not <b>give</b> our attention to anything but these. There was first a low moan. 'No great harm in that,' said Griff; 'it comes through that crack in the wainscot {{where there is a}} sham window. Some putty will put a stop to that.' ...|$|R
