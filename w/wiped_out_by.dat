On December 10, 1952, McCully moved to Quito with his family as a Plymouth Brethren missionary, planning to soon join Elliot and Fleming in Shandia.

5|$|During the strike-shortened 1982 season, {{only nine}} regular season games were played, and a {{modified}} playoff format was instituted. Divisional play was ignored (there were some cases where division rivals had both games <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the strike, although each division ultimately sent {{at least one}} team to the playoffs), and the top eight teams from each conference (based on W-L-T record) were advanced to the playoffs.

5|$|Knights of the Old Republic II starts {{five years}} after the events of the first game and follows the story of The Exile, a Jedi Knight who was exiled from the Jedi Order. During this time, the Jedi Order has been almost {{completely}} <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the Sith. The game begins with the protagonist waking up from unconsciousness on an asteroid mining facility. After he or she escapes with the help of their party members, they find the person who exiled them ten years ago, who sends the protagonist on a mission to seek out the remaining Jedi to fight against the Sith.|$|E

Nearby Kuwuna suffered a similar fate as 80%of the city proper was flooded. There, 58people were killed and 800others were displaced. The towns of Kamezaki and Kamiyoshi were also <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the flood inundation. Further inland, in Nagano Prefecture, strong winds unroofed numerous homes. The United States Air Force's Tachikawa Airfield near Tokyo sustained significant damage from the typhoon, with damage costs totaling in excess of US$1million.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{would not}} raise their Western Conference {{championship}} banner for nearly 15 months, as the 2004–05 season was <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> a labour dispute. During the lock-out, team owner {{and chairman of}} the board, Harley Hotchkiss, attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden. While their discussions failed to save the season, Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> French artillery, {{and pulled back}} with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E

5|$|The Coyotes signed Langkow to a one-year, $2.95 million {{contract}} in August 2004, but dealt {{him to the}} Calgary Flames {{less than two weeks}} later for Oleg Saprykin and Denis Gauthier.

The Flames signed Langkow to a new contract prior to the 2005–06 season amidst high expectations as he was placed on the top line with Jarome Iginla. He finished the season second on the Flames in both goals (25) and points (59) and recorded his sixth consecutive season with 50+ points.|$|E

5|$|Bishop (Lance Henriksen), {{the android}} {{executive}} officer {{assigned to the}} Sulaco, is primarily responsible for planetary maneuvering. When he introduces himself to Ripley, he says that his programming demands complete loyalty and an inability to harm humans (unlike Ash); Ripley is initially distrustful. After most of the Colonial Marines are <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the Aliens on LV-426, Bishop is a medic and technician who ensures that the company's dropship receives Ripley, Newt and Hicks. When he boards the Sulaco, he is impaled and bisected by the stowaway Alien Queen. When Ripley defeats the Queen by opening the airlock, Bishop saves Newt. He is placed into cryosleep with Ripley, Newt and Hicks. When the Sulaco crashes into Fury 161 in Alien 3, Bishop is damaged beyond repair and thrown into the prison's landfill. Although his speech and memory are repaired by Ripley so he can disclose the events leading to the crash, he asks Ripley to shut him down permanently, to which Ripley obliges.|$|E
5|$|In August and October1955, NY344 and the Taconic State Park {{south of}} the road was {{inundated}} with floods damaging the blacktop surface highway. The reconstruction of NY344 was the center point of debate came in late February1956, where Paul Winslow, the executive secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission, who felt it was unimportant if the road was rebuilt. Local officials {{in the town of}} Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956USD) to reconstruct the road. In April1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield that the road was barricaded in Copake Falls for {{the fact that there was}} no residences and the fact that the Massachusetts side was <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the flooding. In November1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY344 was nearly complete by March1957.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E

5|$|Sea {{levels were}} lower during the Pleistocene, {{so it was}} {{possible}} for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Réunion is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on Réunion prior to the volcanic eruption, it would {{have been one of the}} few survivors of this extinction event.|$|E
