40|$|Abstract:- Determining {{the real}} {{behavior}} of the windshield wiper mechanisms is a priority in the design stage since {{the emergence of the}} computer graphic simulation. The paper attempts to analyze and simulate the windshield <b>wiper</b> <b>systems</b> by using a complex virtual prototyping platform, which integrates specific software solutions for realizing the 3 D solid model (CATIA), modeling the MBS mechanical model (ADAMS), and controlling the mechanism (MATLAB). For applying the design strategy, we considered a tandem pattern double-lever system, which is approached in the concurrent engineering concept, by integrating the control system in the mechanical model at the virtual prototype level. To drive the mechanism, a DC motor is used, the objective being to control the angular velocity of the rotor, which is the input parameter in the mechanical model; the output, which is transmitted to the controller, is the motor torque. Driving the system by using the motor torque is more realistic than attaching a motion generator and driving the motion directly...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the {{automotive}} industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances {{in the development of}} safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles.

Because the manual adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause accidents.

The work comprises 30 credits and {{was carried out by}} Dennis Björnberg from Mälardalen University during the fall 2015. Volvo Construction Equipment {{is one of the largest}} manufacturers of construction equipment and among their products are wheel loaders. The assignment involves an investigation and evaluation of today’s windshield and <b>wiper</b> <b>system</b> for large wheel loader which is in need of improvements as today’s solution has reliability issues. As a result the cab department wants new concepts and solution for next generation of wheel loader that considers the current solution issues. This project aims to develop new concepts which answer the research questions developed to guide the project. The executed development process consists of three phases; problem formulation, concept development and finally product development. The first phase, problem formulation involves literature studies, project definition and demand specifications to formulate and guide the project in the right direction. The second phase develops primary concepts and comparisons with competitors and other solutions in a benchmarking leading to a development of the final concept in phase three. The development process resulted in a wide concept solution consisting of a new shaped windshield, a <b>wiper</b> <b>system</b> adjusted to the new windshield and with new frameless wiper blades, a conceptual pneumatic air system to investigate if an air barrier can keep the windshield clean and a recommendation regarding hydrophobic coatings for windshield´s.
