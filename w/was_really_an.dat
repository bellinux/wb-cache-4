5|$|The book {{tells the}} story of a farm boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. Not knowing the stone's origin or worth, he {{attempts}} to use it as payment to a butcher. A dragon he later names Saphira hatches from the stone, which <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> egg. When the evil King Galbatorix finds out the general location of the egg he sends the Ra'zac to acquire it. By that time Saphira had been growing for a while and takes Eragon to the Spine after Ra'zac appear in their village Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their hometown, with a storyteller called Brom, and decide to search for the Varden, a group of rebels who want the downfall of Galbatorix.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair's use {{of local}} {{marketing}} agreements {{would lead to}} legal issues in 1999, when Glencairn, Ltd. (since restructured as Cunningham Broadcasting) {{announced that it would}} acquire Fox affiliate KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from Sullivan Broadcasting; Glencairn subsequently announced plans to sell five of its 11 existing stations that were operated by Sinclair under LMAs to that company outright. As the family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Smith controlled 97% of Glencairn's stock assets (which remains the case under its Cunningham structure) and the company was to be paid with Sinclair stock in turn for the purchases, KOKH and Sinclair-owned WB affiliate KOCB (now a CW affiliate) would effectively constitute a duopoly in violation of FCC rules. The Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) filed challenges against the sale with the FCC, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in a single market and argued that Glencairn was masquerading as a separate minority-owned company (Edwards, who served as Glencairn's president, is African American) when it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> arm of Sinclair that the company used to gain control of the stations through LMAs. After the FCC updated its media ownership rules to allow a single company to own two television stations in the same market in August 1999, Sinclair restructured the deal to acquire KOKH outright. In 2001, the FCC issued a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn.|$|E

They were studying defibrillation in dogs when they noticed that by forcefully applying the paddles {{to the chest}} of the dog, they could achieve a pulse in the femoral artery. Further meticulous experimentation involving dogs answered such basic questions as how fast to press, where to press, and how deep to press. This information gave them the belief that they were ready for human trials.|$|E

25|$|In late 1959, {{historian}} and Beijing Deputy Mayor Wu Han published a historical drama entitled Hai Rui Dismissed from Office. In the play, an honest civil servant, Hai Rui, is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. While Mao initially praised the play, in February 1965 he secretly commissioned his wife Jiang Qing and Shanghai propagandist Yao Wenyuan to publish an article criticizing it. Yao boldly alleged that Hai Rui <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> allegory attacking Mao; that is, Mao was the corrupt emperor and Peng Dehuai was the honest civil servant.|$|E
25|$|The Uzbek {{government}} at first said the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan organised the unrest and the protesters {{were members of}} Hizb ut-Tahrir.

25|$|The Gotha G.II was {{an entirely}} new biplane {{designed}} by Hans Burkhard, who had previously reworked Oskar Ursinus's design for the G.I to make it suitable for mass-production. Burkhard abandoned the G.I's unorthodox configuration {{in favor of a}} more conventional design with the fuselage mounted on the bottom wing rather than the top. In deciding this, he had the benefit of greater pilot experience to draw upon. The difficulties of asymmetric thrust created by losing an engine on a twin-engine design had proved to be not nearly as bad as Ursinus had originally believed, and therefore the G.I's unusual design <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> answer to a non-existent problem. Furthermore, Burkhard had the opportunity to rebuild a crashed G.I (serial number 9/15) and re-arrange its components to place the fuselage on the lower wing, and found this design workable, while also removing the grave danger to the crew that landing accidents posed.|$|E

25|$|With the Bolshevik victory, Swenson {{found not}} just two schooners but his entire Siberian {{business}} and stock impounded and a warrant {{out for his}} arrest. The issues besides alcohol (if that <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> issue) were taxes and his perceived close association with the Whites. He briefly discusses allegations of selling guns to the Whites, suggesting they were inflated, and attributes some allegations to disgruntled competitors. (Hunting arms and ammunition were {{a regular part of}} his business.) He does not mention an allegation of a check for $500,000 found in the pocket of an executed White officer. Swenson reports he declined an offer from a former White officer to raid the coast and recover the furs by force. Instead he and R.S. Pollister (Vice President of Olaf Swenson & Co.) went to China to obtain a Soviet visa and began a long slow process of negotiation to release the furs, trading stock, and books. The ultimate resolution was a contract entered in 1925 to deliver goods in Siberia to Moscow's specification on a cost-plus basis and export furs. This contract was renewed for five years in 1926 and expanded in 1928 after negotiations {{with the head of the}} Soviet fur trust in London. Other associates in this venture were Maurice Cantor and Irving W. Herskovits of New York. In this period, the business name often appears as Swenson Trading Company or Swenson Fur Trading Company. Local trade was handled by a Soviet government trading organization which specified the goods and set fur prices. Swenson reports prices paid to the trappers were reduced in this period and the range of trade goods narrowed to necessities.|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
500|$|McCabe's attack forced Jardine {{to abandon}} his Bodyline approach. Jardine removed Larwood from the attack and brought on Gubby Allen. Under the professional-amateur divide of the time, England's captain was always an amateur, and professionals, such as Larwood, were obliged to obey the captain's orders. Allen was an amateur who refused to bowl Bodyline. McCabe struck three {{consecutive}} fours from Allen's conventional fast bowling, prompting Jardine to call for Bodyline field placings. Allen refused, so Jardine was forced to drop his Bodyline attack and resort to the spin bowling of Hedley Verity and Wally Hammond. The crowd responded to his instinctive aggression with wild cheering. McCabe said that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> impulsive, senseless innings, a gamble that {{should not have been}} made but came off against all the odds".|$|E

After Leto again met the German fan again at a concert in Austria, he asked him to share his story on camera. Leto explained, [...] "At the show in Austria, where there were tens of thousands of people, and I ran into him and interviewed him; he was the first interview of the summer, and he shared this story about losing his father, and what it taught him, it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> organic and serendipitous and beautiful way to begin.

500|$|... "Speechless" [...] {{was one of}} {{only two}} songs from Invincible to be written solely by Jackson (the second song being [...] "The Lost Children"). Jeremy Lubbock worked with the {{musician}} in arranging and conducting an orchestra. Instrumentalists on the track included Brad Buxer on keyboards, and Novi Novog and Thomas Tally on violas. The violinists consisted of Peter Kent, Gina Kronstadt, Robin Lorentz, Kirstin Fife and John Wittenberg. The track featured backing vocals from Andraé Crouch and his gospel choir, The Andraé Crouch Singers. [...] "Speechless" [...] was digitally edited by Buxer and Stuart Brawley, and was mixed by Bruce Swedien, who later said, [...] "Everything with Michael is a stand-out moment but an absolutely gorgeous piece of music called 'Speechless' <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> event.

500|$|Cameron's {{life was}} brought to wider {{attention}} through the publication of two biographies about Parsons: John Carter's Sex and Rockets and George Pendle's Strange Angel. A dramatization of Parsons' life was depicted in the play Moonchild, performed at The Access Theatre on Broadway in 2004. Cameron was portrayed by Heather Tom. In 2011, Wormwood Star, a biography of Cameron authored by the Briton Spencer Kansa, was published, {{though it was not}} authorized by the Cameron–Parsons Foundation. Kansa had spent almost three years in the U.S. researching the book, interviewing many of those who knew Cameron, including several who died shortly after. Kansa stated that most of those whom he interviewed [...] "were immensely generous with their time and recollections" [...] but that [...] "one of Cameron's kookier friends" [...] had begun making claims that Kansa was not a biographer but <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Steffie Nelson noted that Kansa did [...] "his due diligence tracking down Cameron's childhood acquaintances and friends" [...] {{but at the same time}} was critical of the lack of sources or footnotes.|$|E

He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did.

500|$|In 2003, Chevelle {{performed}} at Ozzfest, where the band recorded and later released its first live album, Live from the Road, and a live DVD, Live from the Norva. The band toured Europe with Audioslave in early 2003, {{and later in}} the year they played on the Music as a Weapon II tour with Disturbed. On the tour with Disturbed, Chevelle appeared on the tour compilation album, titled Music as a Weapon II, featuring the songs [...] "The Red" [...] and [...] "Forfeit". [...] Keith Miller of EvangelSociety.org was critical of Chevelle for touring with Ozzfest with bands such as Cradle of Filth, who he claimed incorporated strong satanic and anti-Christian themes into their lyrics.

500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be.
