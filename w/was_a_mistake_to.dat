5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E

He returned to his regular racquet {{for the second half}} of the season. After Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years. Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, and indicated it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> have played certain tournaments while suffering from a back injury.|$|E

5|$|Syme {{argued that}} it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> regard it as a {{historical}} work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the History is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history {{in the manner of}} Tacitus. (The History implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the Quadriga tyrannorum — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the History itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.|$|E

25|$|The Tallyho Hotel and Country Club was {{completed}} in December 1962, {{at a cost of}} $12 million, and was opened in February 1963.

Despite the lack of a casino, the business was operating successfully {{at the time of its}} opening. However, the Tally Ho closed on October 10, 1963, because of low revenue caused by the lack of a casino.

500|$|The Cincinnati Kid {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, a change from the original St. Louis, Missouri, setting of the novel.

Sam Peckinpah was originally hired to direct; producer Martin Ransohoff fired him shortly after filming began for [...] "vulgarizing the picture." [...] Peckinpah's version was to be shot in black-and-white to give the film a 1930s period feel. Jewison scrapped the black-and-white footage, feeling it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>to</b> shoot a film with the red and black of playing cards in greyscale.
