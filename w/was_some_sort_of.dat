5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} pointed out that, architecturally, both the O-13 Pyramid and the Late Classic Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, are nearly identical; both have {{the same number of}} {{substructure}} terraces, and both pyramids' substructures have exactly five doors. Furthermore, both pyramids were built into the sides of existing hills. Damien Marken and Kirk Straight, use this—as well as inscriptions on stelae at Palenque—to argue that there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> relationship between the two polities.|$|E
5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, {{there was}} no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.|$|E

25|$|Despite many {{citations}} {{for safety}} violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides {{and failing to}} report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), {{an investigation by the}} New Jersey Herald, Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was fined only once.

25|$|Another {{sighting}} {{took place}} in 1905 {{off the coast of}} Brazil. The crew of the Valhalla and two naturalists, Michael J. Nicoll and E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, saw a long-necked, turtle-headed creature, with a large squarish or ribbon-like dorsal fin. Based on its dorsal fin and the shape of its head, some (such as Bernard Heuvelmans) have suggested that the animal <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> marine mammal. A skeptical suggestion is that the sighting was of a giant squid swimming with one arm and fin visible, but this is problematical, as there are no reports of squid swimming in such a manner, and no apparent reason why one would.|$|E

500|$|Some islanders {{complained about}} Sark being the last remnant of feudalism in Europe, but the Dame {{maintained}} that agriculture {{had to be}} encouraged to make the island more self-sufficient. She used the island's unique feudal system to draw tourists, and refused to allow anything to deter them by ruining its peacefulness. She thus banned motor vehicles and holiday camps, but the Chief Pleas refused to pass an ordinance that would forbid selling alcohol to anyone known to get drunk. Like her eldest son Francis, heir apparent to the seigneurship, she was fascinated by film production. While Appointment with Venus was being shot on Sark in 1951, the Dame even deigned to allow a car ashore, ostensibly believing that [...] "a Land Rover <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> senior Boy Scout".|$|E

500|$|Following the season, on 31 May 2008, Milan {{vice-president}} Adriano Galliani {{revealed that}} the club would loan Gourcuff to French club Bordeaux for the entire 2008–09 season to allow him more playing time. In 2010, {{in an interview with}} French newspaper L'Equipe, former Milan captain Paolo Maldini stated that Gourcuff lacked discipline while at the club and often distanced himself from the team citing the player's refusal to learn the Italian language. Maldini also stated that Gourcuff did not give his all during his stint at Milan and that the player himself knew it. Gourcuff did not respond to the comments, but his father Christian did, stating to France Football that there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> conspiracy out there looking to tarnish his son's image. The elder Gourcuff responded to Maldini's charges stating his son [...] "took two hours (of Italian language courses) per day and spoke Italian after two months" [...] and that [...] "he is passionate about tactics" [...] in response to Maldini saying Gourcuff refused to learn Italian and he was limited tactically. Gourcuff was also defended by his club president Jean-Louis Triaud at his former club Bordeaux who stated in response to Maldini's comments [...] "Yoann is not like that. A number ten who does not play with the group is a little weird. This does not correspond at all to what we saw with Yoann at Bordeaux. He was well integrated with his teammates, and collectively with them on the ground. He left good memories here." ...|$|E

500|$|Usher and Minaj {{shot the}} music video on March 9, 2010 in Los Angeles with {{director}} Taj Stansberry, represented by Leah Harmony and Ciarra Pardo.

[...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people into a situation. Because you have your thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E
