The Grote Kerk was probably established between 1156 and 1164 and has been expanded, damaged and rebuilt. To the north of the old harbour is the old Aeolus) windmill, which operates and sells ground cereals. The harbour is a marina and open-air museum with old ships. At the harbour is the [...] (before: [...] Visserijmuseum and the Visserij en Vlaardings Museum), a museum dedicated to commercial sea fishing and lore. A war memorial to the crew of a Wellington bomber killed when it was shot down over Vlaardingen in March 1942 has recently been erected.|$|E
40|$|For assuring {{the design}} of a produk, the design itself holds an {{important}} matter. As a designer, we face problems that we must create the strong design but must fullfil others points, like a light weight structure, competitive prizes, and many other point. Usually in the daily life, where the design is too strong and powerfull so that makes extra budget at the production process. In other hand, we also meet the opposite situation, when the design were sacrificed for the sake of production cost. In this calculation of the <b>weighing</b> <b>bridge</b> models, the finite element method based on ANSYS software were chosen because of the manual calculation were to difficult to solve the calculation and also takes longer time to accomplished. Meanwhile, Pugh?s concept selection method were chosen because of its efficiency for choosing the best solution from adequate solution that were born from the calculation. So we can choose the best solution based on this method, in both side, the strength of the structure and also the production cost. From the analysis based on ANSYS software and selection using the Pugh?s matrix selection, the result, the <b>weighing</b> <b>bridge</b> best build using I beam 500 x 200 (ASTM A- 572) for the main structure and I beam 250 x 125 (ASTM A- 572) sebagai support bea...|$|E

40|$|Live {{weight and}} linear body {{measurements}} (wither height, body length and heart girth) of 133 Ogaden cattle, maintained at Alemaya University, {{were taken from}} July 24 to July 28, 2001. Weighing was done using <b>weighing</b> <b>bridge</b> of the farm {{in the morning before}} the animals went out for grazing. A textile measuring tape was used to measure linear measurements. Most nimals were in a good condition during the measurement, possibly due to the good grass growth of the season. Age of the animals was calculated as a difference between measurement date and the recorded birth date. For those without birth date records, dentition was used to classify into four convenient age groups, which had average ages of 64. 3, 37. 2, 20. 4 and 1. 2 months for females and 38. 0, 37. 4, 20. 5 and 0. 12 months, for males, respectively. Mature females measured 280. 5 kg for body weight, 161. 4 cm for heart girth, 116. 4 cm for height at withers and 141. 0 for body length. Similarly males measured 321. 0 kg for live weight, 161. 3 cm for heart girth, 118. 0 cm for height at withers and 141. 5 cm for body length. The coat colour of this herd is uniform plain white. However, some animals have shades of black around the face, hump and rump. Hump is thoracic in location, large and prominent in both sexes, but larger in males. Most of the animals are polled, but when present, it is short and thick. The head profile is flat and the back line is straight. Lactation is not recorded from the herd, but a recent milk off-take measurement using a weigh-suckle-weigh method showed a range of 1 to 6 litres per cow per day. However, it is known that herd owners in the traditional Ogaden area mainly keep these cattle for their milk...|$|E
40|$|Gampong Jawa dumpsite was {{established}} in 1994 as part of Banda Aceh Municipality (BAM) efforts to participate in Adipura Award for the category of clean and green city. The 12 ha area was a dumpsite for most of wastes from BAM and Aceh Besar District. When earthquake/tsunami hit Banda Aceh in December 2004, it was completely destroyed and all the wastes were swept away. This paper is aimed to present the lessons of how a dumpsite is rehabilitated to a landfill. Some issues and challenges are discussed, i. e. the development process; land acquisition; technical consideration i. e. DED, leachate and LFG management, geotechnical aspects; social aspects contributes to minimise waste production; and other supporting facilities. After the tsunami, the dumpsite {{was used as a}} final disposal area for tsunami wastes collected from BAM and Aceh Besar. In 2006, BAM expanded the area by purchasing the surrounding 9 ha nonproductive fish ponds. In 2008, the Agency for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi / BRR) initiated the rehabilitation by constructing a new sanitary landfill which was initially operated in January 2009. The landfill operation is currently supported with necessary equipments and sufficient budget. BAM allocates IDR 1. 3 billion annually for O&M. A number of new facilities are recently being provided, e. g. <b>weighing</b> <b>bridge</b> and MRF facilities. Moreover, it is being upgraded to a transfer station while Blang Bintang Regional Landfill is under construction during 2012. Currently the total of waste disposal is 155 tons/day, 15 % of the waste is sorted for any recyclable and compost materials. It is expected that Gampong Jawa Landfill will contribute useful information for local governments, either in Aceh or other districts in Indonesia, mainly for the policy makers involved in urban planning, specifically solid waste management sector, to include a sustainable urban solid waste management, especially landfill development as integrated part of i...|$|E

The article looks at a new dosing system using an innovative new screw feed, analysing the results of tests {{carried out in the}} WAM Spa laboratories. The screw feed doser was developed to respond to the growing demand for an accurate dosing system {{as an alternative to the}} conventional weighing conveyor belts. Screw feeders are known for their simple construction and reliability. Originally developed for use in the food industry they have gone on to find application in a wide range of industries. The screw feed is a closed system capable of handling volatile material. Another important advantage is that it is as economical and as efficient as weighing belts. The screw feed system consists of a screw feed, <b>weigh</b> <b>bridge</b> and automatic checking and regulating system. The tests carried out produced satisfactory results, showing this system to be efficient and reliable.
