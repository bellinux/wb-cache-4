25|$|As New York City's World Trade Center {{collapsed}} {{following the}} September 11 attacks, Lower Manhattan was blanketed {{in a mixture}} of building debris and combustible materials. This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete. More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings' destruction. Inhalation of a mixture of asbestos and other toxicants is thought to be linked to the unusually high death rate from cancer of emergency service workers since the disaster. Thousands more are now thought to be at risk of developing cancer due to this exposure <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died so far being only the 'tip of the iceberg'.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{communication}} with consumers attracts the attention of companies. However, the issue of interpersonal communication has been under-researched. Consumers can adopt the brand {{as a result of}} communication <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> adopted the brand (internal impact of the brand), or as a result of interactions <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> adopted competing brands (the cross-brand effect). The paper shows that the interaction of internal and cross-brand impact can {{have a significant effect on}} the growth of the market. The focus is on the case of two identical competing brands with different time of entry into the market. Due to the internal impact of the brand, consumers can create an interaction-based advantage for the brand which first entered the market, and this advantage grows over time. Similarly, the cross-brand effect enables the accompanying brand to enjoy faster growth on the market...|$|R
2500|$|Memory for {{previous}} interactions {{is critical}} for successful long-term social relationships.

These memories {{play an important role in}} deciding whether or not a human interacts with another in the future, as they contribute to the construction of a person's reputation. [...] Milinski, Semmann & Krambeck (2002) have demonstrated, through the use of public goods games and indirect reciprocity games, that humans are less likely to interact <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a reputation for not equivalently returning the favour.|$|E
2500|$|The ideal goal {{of anger}} {{management}} is {{to control and}} regulate anger {{so that it does}} not result in problems. [...] Anger is an active emotion that calls the person feeling it to respond. People get into anger issues because both the instigator and instigated lack interpersonal and social skills to maintain self-control. They can train to respond to their anger as unwanted and unpleasant rather than react to its need. Turning a blind eye or forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off. Getting enough sleep, exercise and good diet are tools which can assist in preventing anger. Professionals who deal <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> trouble managing anger include occupational therapists, mental health counselors, drug and alcohol counselors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists.|$|E
