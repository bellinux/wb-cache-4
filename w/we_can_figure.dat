500|$|Make-up effects artist Matthew Mungle was {{responsible}} for portraying the decomposition of Mulder's and Miles's bodies. Spotnitz was particularly impressed with Miles's autopsy scene, calling it [...] "something new to do [...] late stage of the game". Since human bodies which have decomposed in water become grotesquely deformed, Miles's body was [...] "a toned-down version of what the reality would be." [...] To create the scene, plaster bandages were {{used to create a}} cast of the front and back of Ansley's body; these, in turn, were used to create a fiberglass cast. This was sculpted over with water clay to create the appearance of a bloated body. Afterwards, a mold of the clay was made and a body suit created with latex. As the project proceeded, Mungle sent photos to Carter, who gave final approval. In Miles's shower scene, a mix of [...] "red goo", which included strawberry jam, was placed on Ansley's skin. Fake skin, created from thin pieces of urethane, was then placed on top of this mixture and warm water was pumped through to create the illusion of shedding flesh. Mungle reportedly had only six days to complete the prosthetics for the episode. Mungle later noted that after being told what the scene would entail he asked, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> something out, could we show it on TV?" [...] While the studio approved the footage, Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "awfully graphic"; he was surprised the sequence got past censors since {{it would be difficult to}} show in a PG-rated film.|$|E

6000|$|Louis XV. {{had always}} the kingliest abhorrence of Death. Unlike that praying Duke of Orleans, Egalite's grandfather,--for indeed {{several of them}} had a touch of madness,--who honesty {{believed}} that there was no Death! He, if the Court Newsmen can be believed, started up once on a time, glowing with sulphurous contempt and indignation on his poor Secretary, who had stumbled on the words, feu roi d'Espagne (the late King of Spain): [...] "Feu roi, Monsieur?"--"Monseigneur," [...] hastily answered the trembling but adroit man of business, [...] "c'est une titre qu'ils prennent ('tis a title they take)." [...] (Besenval, i. 199.) Louis, we say, was not so happy; but he did what he could. He would not suffer Death to be spoken of; avoided the sight of churchyards, funereal monuments, and whatsoever could bring it to mind. It is the resource of the Ostrich; who, hard hunted, sticks his foolish head in the ground, and would fain forget that his foolish unseeing body is not unseen too. Or sometimes, with a spasmodic antagonism, significant of the same thing, and of more, he would go; or stopping his court carriages, would send into churchyards, and ask 'how many new graves there were today,' though it gave his poor Pompadour the disagreeablest qualms. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> the thought of Louis that day, when, all royally caparisoned for hunting, he met, at some sudden turning in the Wood of Senart, a ragged Peasant with a coffin: [...] "For whom?"--It was for a poor brother slave, whom Majesty had sometimes noticed slaving in those quarters. [...] "What did he die of?"--"Of hunger:"--the King gave his steed the spur. (Campan, iii. 39.) ...|$|E

50|$|Chapter 1 {{talks about}} how to train the mind to become happier; with Chapter 2, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out our sources of {{happiness}} or unhappiness.

Compared to this story, a man is told he’s HIV positive, which brings him to a lower level of happiness, but he soon begins to appreciate every day life more (19-20). These two examples in the book help explain how “happiness is determined more by one’s state of mind than by external events” (20). Being at a life’s high, winning the lottery, or being at a low, diagnosed with cancer, we eventually get back to our baseline level. This baseline level is described in the book as how we react to life-changing news; even then our lives will reach a normal baseline again (21).|$|E

Horowitz explained, [...] "We have been allowed to do more {{at the start of the}} season.
