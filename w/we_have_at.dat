I feel I haven't played as much as I would love to because of the great players <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> Barcelona". Fellow Barcelona player Giovanni van Bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club: [...] "It's special to win the final, and even more special to do it against your old team". Samuel Eto'o, scorer of Barcelona's first goal, cited Liverpool's comeback against Milan as inspiration for Barcelona's victory: [...] "After having seen what Liverpool did last year, we told ourselves not to throw in the towel. We followed Liverpool's example". Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard praised the role of goalkeeper Victor Valdés in their victory, stating {{that he made a}} number of important saves to keep them in the match: [...] "Valdes played a decisive role. He saved us at crucial moments".|$|E
500|$|With its [...] "furious, anarchist edge", [...] "Gandhi Mate, Gandhi" [...] {{focuses on}} the {{distinction}} between social and economic stability, summarising capitalism as [...] "a long outdated system... that does nothing but divide and segregate us". The song {{has been seen as}} supporting the Occupy London movement; Reynolds called it a [...] "very frustrated and confused song" [...] reflecting the current Zeitgeist: [...] "People know we have the resources, the creativity, and the ingenuity to do better than what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> the moment and are struggling {{to come to terms with}} the short term love of money over the long-term stability and progression of our species." [...] The song focuses on two characters; Reynolds' vocals supply a revolutionary perspective, and Rory Clewlow's are those of a person in power. [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] has unconventional lyrics for its characters; [...] "Yabba Dabba do one, son" [...] was described by Reynolds as the product of a drunken MC battle, and during the song the other band members pause and urge Reynolds to calm down. Reynolds described [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] as a [...] "lively electro influenced dubstep" [...] and a [...] "rap rock pileup" [...] textured over [...] "wobbly dubstep bass".|$|E
500|$|Michigan {{entered the}} game as the No. 5-ranked team in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Media outlets {{projected}} the team as favorites to win the Big Ten conference, and as contenders for a national championship. Michigan featured a strong senior class of offensive tackle Jake Long, tailback Mike Hart, and quarterback Chad Henne, each of whom had decided {{to stay in school}} rather than declare eligibility for the NFL Draft. The players attributed their decision to several factors, such as Michigan having lost their last three games to rival Ohio State and the Wolverines' streak of three consecutive bowl losses. The three also desired to finish their college careers on a high note. Mark Schlabach of ESPN.com stated that [...] ", along with receivers Mario Manningham and Adrian Arrington, gives Michigan what could potentially {{be one of the most}} explosive offenses in college football". Prior to the season, the team named Hart and Long as captains, along with linebacker Shawn Crable, a fifth-year senior. [...] Michigan aimed to open the game in a three-receiver formation, which has the potential to spread the opposing defense out; Michigan coach Lloyd Carr noted that [...] "when you have some of the skill that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> the wide receiver positions and can spread a defense out, that's [...] positive." [...] At the same time, Michigan was anticipated to run only a limited selection of plays from this set, to limit the ability of their upcoming opponents to develop an effective game plan against them. Michigan's defense, which led the FBS in run defense in 2006, lost seven starters from the previous season, including four All-Americans (cornerback Leon Hall and defensive linemen Alan Branch, David Harris, and LaMarr Woodley), each of whom were drafted in the first two rounds of the 2007 NFL Draft. Wolverines linebacker Chris Graham, a senior, expected the defense to be defined by speed, noting that each position on the defense was [...] "loaded in speed".|$|E

Dyke said that [...] "The figures <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> the moment suggest that {{quite a lot of}} people from different ethnic backgrounds that we do attract to the BBC leave. Maybe they don't feel at home, maybe they don't feel welcome." [...] Dyke set a target that by 2003, 10% of the BBC's UK workforce and 4% of management would be from ethnic minority backgrounds. In September 2004, Dyke received an award for his remarks from Glasgow-based organisation Empower Scotland, which fights against workplace racism.|$|E

In a 1967 rehearsal of Die Walküre with Herbert von Karajan conducting, Nilsson responded to the gloomy lighting of the production by wearing a miner's helmet (complete with Valkyrian wings). When on some occasion von Karajan urged a retake [...] "and this time with our hearts – that's where your wallet has its place", Nilsson replied, [...] "I'm glad to know that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> least one thing in common, Maestro von Karajan!" [...] When Georg Solti, in Tristan und Isolde, insisted on tempos too slow for Nilsson's taste, she made the first performance even slower, inducing a conductorial change of heart. After a tiff with Hans Knappertsbusch, Nilsson reported: [...] "He called me by a name that begins with [...] "A" [...] and ends with 'hole'".|$|E

Vernon added a suite of eighteen bedrooms and saloons to the Hotel. In 1901 the first telephones were installed in Shanghai, with the Astor House having the first telephone used.

2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, {{we are forced to}} focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay attention to that feeling… Distraction {{is one of the best}} tools for innovation <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>at</b> our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns" ...|$|E
