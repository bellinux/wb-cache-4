5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to termite attack; the differences are attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{approached}} and their ammunition ran dangerously low, Bouck feared {{they could be}} flanked at any time. He planned to pull his men back just before dusk, when they would have enough light to escape through the woods. Bouck ordered his men to remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear. He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston through the <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements.|$|E

They would be responsible for defending an area from the Château Saint Come, across a clearing in the <b>woods,</b> <b>to</b> a house known as the Bois de Mont. To their front was a stretch of open land leading to Bréville-les-Monts and the road from Amfreville to Le Mesnil-les-Monts. A shortage in their numbers left a large gap between the 9th Parachute Battalion and No. 6 Commando, the most southern unit in the commando defensive position, to their north.|$|E

5|$|Bahuchara Mata is {{a patron}} goddess of the Hirja. In popular {{iconography}} she is often shown riding a rooster {{and carrying a}} sword, trident and a book. Various stories link Bahuchara to castration or other changes in physical sexual characteristics, sometimes {{as the result of}} her aiming curses against men. Bahuchara is believed to have originated as a mortal woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off her breasts and dies. In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.|$|E
5|$|Bermuda's {{debut in}} the Olympic Games began with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Nazi Germany, when the Bermudian {{delegation}} included five athletes, all men. Bermuda had appeared in twenty-one Olympic Games between 1936 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics. Of those twenty-one games, sixteen of them were Summer Olympics. Bermuda had, prior to Beijing, earned one medal, when Clarence Hill won bronze in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 2008 Bermudian delegation had fewer people than it usually sent abroad, prompting {{the president of the}} Bermudian Olympic Association Austin <b>Woods</b> <b>to</b> complain publicly that the year's Olympic team lacked access to quality coaches, administrators, and facilities, and with the exception of several athletes, lacked the skill to be competitive.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its size}} and {{geologic}} features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10% of Texas' land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney <b>woods,</b> <b>to</b> rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>to</b> {{the east}} is {{dominated}} by Bramble, Bluebell, Wood Anemone, Wood Sorrel and Ivy.

The news about the encounter spreads quickly and Bigfoot hunters converge on the <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie finds herself separated from the family and raised by bears.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, two {{teenagers}} {{get into a}} fight in the woods. The girl, named Maggie (Jillian Bach), runs into the <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> be alone and Kevin (Angelo Vacco), her boyfriend, gives chase. However, he is attacked and his heart is removed. Meanwhile, the writer intensely transcribes the event on his typewriter. The next day, Mulder and Scully discuss this latest incident via phone. An unmarked envelope is discovered by Scully in the office containing a milagro, a type of pendant. While she examines the pendant, a voice-over from the writer describes Scully's most intimate feelings as she examines the unsolicited gift.|$|E

In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent {{that this is the}} man who has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E
30|$|Such {{advances}} {{allowed the}} <b>wood</b> <b>to</b> be segregated for specific purposes, because the technological characteristics of determined products were known. Through {{the use of}} classical forestry improvement tools, cloning, and genomics the production of custom <b>wood</b> <b>to</b> several industrial applications, such as carbonization, pulp and paper, panels, among others, has been possible.|$|R

Mulder is reluctant to let Scully come along because of her recent abduction; Scully, however, insists that she is ready. Upon arriving at Mount Avalon, Pierce goes out in the <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> inspect the project's equipment while the agents search the laboratory. They discover the seemingly traumatized team: robotics engineer Jason Ludwig (Leland Orser), systems analyst Peter Tanaka (Hiro Kanagawa), and graduate student Jessie O'Neil (Shawnee Smith). They claim that Trepkos destroyed their lab and disappeared after Firewalker's first descent. Meanwhile, outside, Trepkos strangles Pierce.|$|E
5|$|The Puncheon Run Connector {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with US 13 in Dover, {{heading to the}} northeast as a four-lane freeway. After passing over State Street, the freeway curves {{to the east and}} passes between <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> the south and residential and commercial development to the north. The road crosses over the marshy St. Jones River and continues east-northeast, passing between a residential neighborhood to the south and the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) headquarters to the north before coming to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance at Bay Road. Immediately after the Bay Road interchange, the Puncheon Run Connector merges into northbound DE 1 a short distance to the north of Dover Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|The seventh Baron {{attempted}} {{to retain the}} house and estate by opening to the public. An adventure playground {{was built in the}} nearby <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house, garden and some of the contents to the National Trust, a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties. The National Trust further purchased at a cost of £8 million (worth about £ today) 1,317acres (5.3km²) of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.|$|E

5|$|To {{serve the}} growing {{population}} of the council estate, the Middleton Light Railway, an electric tramway, was built in 1925 by Leeds Corporation. The tramway from Leeds ran parallel to the colliery line to Hunslet Moor staithes and then headed south through Middleton <b>Woods</b> <b>to</b> a terminus on the Ring Road. The tramway {{was made into a}} circular route in 1949 when it was extended to Belle Isle Road and Balm Road in Hunslet. The tramway closed in 1959. Its route through the park is now a footpath.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the Smyrna River, DE 9 enters New Castle County and becomes Fleming Landing Road, passing through agricultural areas with some <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> {{the west of}} the Cedar Swamp Wildlife Area. The road runs to the north before curving northwest again. The route turns west onto Taylors Bridge Road and crosses the marshy Blackbird Creek. DE 9 curves to the north-northwest and passes through more rural areas with some residential subdivisions to the west. The route heads to the northwest before turning northeast onto Thomas Corner Road in Mathews Corners, with DE 299 continuing northwest on Taylors Bridge Road towards Odessa, where the Odessa Historic District is located.|$|E
5|$|When questioned, the Woodsman (whose name is Kirk) {{reveals that}} he is in fact an {{aspiring}} actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he went out into the <b>woods</b> <b>to</b> get in character for his role and {{spent the rest of the}} day chopping trees. A large tree rolled after him and pushed him through the window of Granny's home.
