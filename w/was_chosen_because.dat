5|$|The Northwest Territories {{government}} {{moved to}} Battleford in 1877 {{on the order}} of the Lieutenant Governor. Battleford {{was supposed to be the}} permanent capital of the Territories. The town <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> it was expected to be linked with the Canadian Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|IG Farben {{acquired}} {{the property in}} 1927 to establish its headquarters there. In the 1920s, IG Farben (full German name Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft) was the world's largest drug, chemical and dye conglomerate. Frankfurt <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> of its centrality and its accessibility by air and land.|$|E

5|$|The Turn of the Screw {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in the West Country of England, beginning in August 2009. The scenes at Bly were filmed at Brympton d'Evercy, a manor house near Yeovil, Somerset. Brympton <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> of its similarity to Bly House, as described by James, including its extensive grounds and large lake. The railway scenes were filmed at the East Somerset Railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was opened by Janet Thickpenny, {{a young mother}} from Barry, who <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> her 40th birthday coincided {{with that of the}} opening day. A human chain delivered the symbolic key, designed and cast by Ann Catrin Evans, to Janet with a fanfare from the National Youth Brass Band of Wales to a Karl Jenkins specially commissioned work In These Stones Horizons Sing and the Centre was open.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was {{to include the}} letter r (for revision) after the main version number and then {{the number of the}} point release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.|$|E

5|$|After {{reading about}} the case while in college, Peirce {{conducted}} extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses {{on the relationship between}} Brandon and his girlfriend Lana Tisdel. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary The Brandon Teena Story. Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> her personality seemed similar to Teena's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were composites.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{elections}} for the Chamber of Deputies returned unfavourable results for Talleyrand. The ministry wished for moderate deputies, but the electorate voted almost exclusively for ultra-royalists, resulting in the so-called Chambre introuvable. The Duchess of Angoulême and the Count of Artois pressured King Louis for the dismissal of his obsolete ministry. Talleyrand tendered his resignation on 20 September. Louis XVIII chose the Duke of Richelieu to be his new Prime Minister. Richelieu <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> he was accepted by Louis's family and the reactionary Chamber of Deputies.|$|E

5|$|Kevin McNally {{was cast}} as the {{antagonist}} Robert Osbourne; McNally <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> the producers {{thought he would be}} perfect to play the part, {{as is the case with}} Debra Stephenson, who portrayed his wife. Child actor Daniel Chenery, who played the part of their son, Sammy, was chosen due to his likeness of a younger version of McNally. Also, Simon Crawford Collins's wife made a cameo appearance as a BT operator.|$|E
5|$|Popper {{eventually}} relented, after {{admitting that}} the larger dreadnought type design would also warrant {{the construction of a}} new floating dry dock, which would significantly increase the cost of the project. The design board selected the fifth design, though during refinement of the design, the secondary guns were increased in caliber from 19cm to 24cm. The 30.5cm gun <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> the breech of the new 28cm was unreliable. The resulting design was the last pre-dreadnought type of battleship built by the Austro-Hungarian navy.|$|E
5|$|The Day of Reconciliation is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. The date <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures. The government chose a meaningful date for both ethnic groups because they recognize the need for racial harmony. The celebration of the Day of Reconciliation can take the form of remembering past history, recognizing veteran's contributions, marching and other festivities.|$|E
50|$|Historians {{came up with}} {{different}} variations of the list, but always with 17 members. This number could have <b>been</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> of its Christian connotation.|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} shot mainly at the 103-year-old former Tennessee State Prison in Nashville, which had {{previously}} been used for filming in The Green Mile and Last Dance, and <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> of its Gothic and castle-like appearance. The state of Tennessee offered to provide the location rent-free, with exemption from the state's 6percent state sales tax. James Gandolfini earned $5million for co-starring in the film after finishing the third season of The Sopranos in March 2001.|$|E
5|$|The show follows {{several groups}} of meerkats, who act communally {{for the benefit}} of the groups in which they live. These groups are {{typically}} led by a dominant female and male, who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring. The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family. This group <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> of its matriarch Flower, an unusually successful dominant female who led the group for five years. During series three, Flower died from a snake bite and was succeeded by her daughter Rocket Dog.|$|E
5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, Npower {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new £2billion clean coal power station on the site. The proposed station would have generated electricity using three 800MW advanced supercritical steam, high-efficiency coal-fired units, giving the station a total generation capacity of 2,400MW. This was one of two new coal-fired stations proposed by Npower in the UK. The site <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> of its readily available proximity to the national grid, its rail and port links, and its position next to the North Sea, which is useful for both cooling water, and as a potential CO2 storage site, where CO2 could be piped to oil and gas wells, and saline aquifers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Salomon's three sons, Avraham, Ovadia and Danny, assumed {{managerial}} positions; {{they became}} co-CEOs after Salomon's death in 1966. In 1958 Angel's Bakery moved to its present {{location in the}} Givat Shaul industrial zone {{at the corner of}} Beit Hadfus and Farbstein Streets. The site <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> it stood across the street from a flour mill. The Angel brothers built Israel's first flour silo and commissioned a Texas company to construct a 750-foot pipeline to convey flour directly from the mill to the silo to the bakery. Today this pipeline brings 120 tons of flour to the bakery daily. The invention, initially opposed by the Jerusalem municipality for being above-ground, won the Kaplan Prize for distinction in productivity and efficiency.|$|E
5|$|It had {{now become}} clear to President Johnson that McNamara {{had become a}} {{liability}} to the administration. In February 1968, McNamara resigned his position {{and was replaced by}} Clark Clifford, who <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>because</b> of his personal friendship with Johnson and his previous opposition to McNamara's suggestions that the number of troops in the South Vietnam be stabilized and that Rolling Thunder be ended. McNamara's position, however was almost immediately taken up by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, (until then an ardent advocate of the bombing campaign). Rusk proposed limiting the campaign to the panhandle of North Vietnam without preconditions and awaiting Hanoi's reaction. Within months Clifford too began to adopt the views of the man he had replaced, gradually becoming convinced that the U.S. had to withdraw from an open-ended commitment to the war.|$|E
