The song was later {{released}} on the BASEketball soundtrack and the international version of their album <b>Why</b> <b>Do</b> <b>They</b> Rock So Hard?. The band also performed the song at concerts. Reel Big Fish released a video clip for [...] "Take On Me", directed by Jeff Moore, and features the band playing the song while walking down an aisle in the stadium, and playing a game of BASEketball interlaced with clips from the film. An alternative video for the song's international release that contained only the stadium aisle footage was also released.

500|$|Three years later, in the {{build-up}} to {{the release}} of Manhunt 2, the controversy re-ignited. Two days after announcing the game, which was set for release in July, Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) issued a statement which read, in part: [...] "We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case." [...] Later that day, however, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel, and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Upon the announcement of the sequel, Patrick stated [...] "I'm very disappointed. This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the month we will be marking the anniversary of Stefan's death. I'm very surprised they are doing this after all that has happened and all the publicity." [...] Giselle added [...] "It is an insult to my son's memory that they have announced this game in the month we will be marking this anniversary. These game moguls are {{making a lot of money}} out of games which are morally indecent. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> have to pump more violence into society?" [...] Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was [...] "astonished" [...] that Rockstar were making a sequel; [...] "It is contempt for those who are trying very hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1977, British {{psychiatrist}} David Cooper asked Foucault {{the same}} question which Claude Bourdet had formerly asked Viktor Fainberg during a press conference given by Fainberg and Leonid Plyushch: when the USSR has the whole penitentiary and police apparatus, which could take charge of anybody, and which is perfect in itself, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> use psychiatry? Foucault answered {{it was not a}} question of a distortion of the use of psychiatry but that was its fundamental project. In the discussion Confinement, Psychiatry, Prison, Foucault states the cooperation of psychiatrists with the KGB in the Soviet Union was not abuse of medicine, but an evident case and [...] "condensation" [...] of psychiatry's [...] "inheritance", an [...] "intensification, the ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function." [...] Foucault believed that the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR of the 1960s was a logical extension of the invasion of psychiatry into the legal system. In the discussion with Jean Laplanche and Robert Badinter, Foucault says that criminologists of the 1880â€”1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language: [...] "The crime cannot be, for the criminal, but an abnormal, disturbed behavior. If he upsets society, it's because he himself is upset". This led to the twofold conclusions. First, [...] "the judicial apparatus is no longer useful." [...] The judges, as men of law, understand such complex, alien legal issues, purely psychological matters no better than the criminal. So commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for the judicial apparatus. And in this vein, concrete projects were proposed. Second, [...] "We must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick. But, at the same time, we must protect society against him." [...] Hence comes the idea of mental isolation with a mixed function: therapeutic and prophylactic. In the 1900s, these projects have given rise to very lively responses from European judicial and political bodies. However, they found a wide field of applications when the Soviet Union {{became one of the most}} common but by no means exceptional cases.|$|E

[...] Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, [...] "Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount." [...] In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, [...] "If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you." [...] His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000. In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, [...] "There was a lot of Norma in her, you know." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, {{as late as the}} year 2007, Benson claimed, in marketing the [...] "Reliance Defense Package" [...] that included his non-ratification argument, that [...] "o date, the IRS has steadfastly refused to prosecute any person standing on this defense. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> do this?

2500|$|Percival's {{connections}} to the British Royal Navy frequently lead him to raid and destroy French ships, and the only specific reference to piracy in the novel comes when Percival is taken hostage by a crew of runaway slaves. The pirate crew is described as 'negro' and captain Vincent swears to kill any white sailor whom he captures, burning slave-traders alive and throwing others overboard. Percival is the first white captive that Vincent decides to spare, and the two often seem sympathetic of each other, with Percival {{going so far as}} to dye his skin a darker color to please the captain. Vincent makes several connections in the text between race and piracy, mentioning that the black race is branded with the [...] "curse of Cain" [...] and that, [...] "even the white pirates feel the truth of this, or <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> hoist the black flag?" [...] Sarah Ficke interprets the pirate episode of Percival Keene as representing the chaos of giving up national identity in favor of a racial identity. [...] "By transforming piracy into racial warfare in this novel, Marryat expresses his anxieties about the nature of a national identity that would incorporate ethnic others as legal and political equivalents." [...] Other critics suggest that this nationalist relationship between British sailors and black slaves is further explored by Marryat in Peter Simple ...|$|E

2500|$|Giles and O'Keefe {{have been}} criticized for {{accuracy}} problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds. Leonnig also observed:the videos, in some cases, left out what I would call some exculpatory material ... for example, in one, a San Bernadino employee at ACORN explains {{that there is no way}} ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, candid-camera style.During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: [...] " [...] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." [...] He asked, [...] "s that what you think a pimp looks like?" [...] O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress. Stark said, [...] "If they really wanted the truth out there, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?" ...|$|E
