She carries the daggers to the room and smears the drugged attendants with blood. The couple retire to <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Things were {{different}} for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests {{so they could}} <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes {{made it difficult for}} women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out at Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria to assess the water {{sanitation}} and hygiene practices among randomly selected households. A total of 450 respondents were given questionnaires to fill. Information obtained from the questionnaires revealed that 56. 4 % treated their water while 43. 6 % did not. Among those that treated their water, 28 % boiled their water, 20. 1 % filtered with alum and 33. 5 % used chlorine. 67. 3 % of the households had pour flush toilet, 16 % used ventilated improved pit latrine and 1. 8 % went into the bush for defecation. Results also showed that 37. 3 % <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> after using the toilet and 43. 5 % <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> after eating. While 25. 8 % <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> with water only, 28 % <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> with medicated soap and water. 31. 8 % {{of the respondents reported}} a history of sickness from water usage while 68. 2 % did not. The symptoms experienced include stomach pain 28. 7 %, fever 28. 7 %, stooling 30. 8 % and vomiting 11. 9 %. Sensitization of the populace toward proper disposal of household waste, promotion of good hygiene practices and treatment of drinking water was recommended.

25|$|As a result, {{his ideas}} were {{rejected}} by the medical community. Other, more subtle, factors may also have played a role.

25|$|Medical hand-washing became {{mandatory}} {{long after}} Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease {{in a hospital}} environment.

25|$|Technically, {{according}} to Jewish law, whenever one partakes of fruits or vegetables dipped in liquid while remaining wet, one must wash one's hands, if the fruit or vegetable remains wet.

40|$|Using {{ward rounds}} in the {{department}} of surgery at a major teaching hospital, {{and with the help of}} the preregistration house officers (PRHO), we assessed whether the lesson taught to us by Semmelweis had been forgotten. We asked the PHROs to count the number of patients examined by their consultant or registrar on a ward round, together with the number of wounds examined, and the number of times they <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> between patients. Over a 2 -week period, following seven consultants and four registrars, 26 ward rounds were followed. Of 239 patient events, which are defined as a clinician reviewing a patient in order to assess their treatment, a total of 88 involved an examination (37 %) and, of these, 41 had postoperative wounds (47 %). The number of times clinicians <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> between examinations was 36 (41 %). Between the two groups of clinicians, the consultants <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> 30 times in 55 examinations (55 %), while the registrars <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> six times in 23 examinations (26 %). When Semmelweis died in 1865 his beliefs were still largely ignored by clinicians. It would seem from our results that in both senior and junior staff the simple exercise of handwashing is not practised de rigor. For the safety of the patient and the clinician we recommend a more fastidious adoption of the handwashing practice...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day.

The Jewish Encyclopedia relates that according to Herodotus the Egyptian priests were required to wash themselves twice a day and twice a night in cold water, and according to Hesiod the Greeks were forbidden from pouring out the black wine to any deity in the morning, unless they had first <b>washed</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R

25|$|Oocysts in cat feces take {{at least}} a day to sporulate and become {{infectious}} after they are shed, so disposing of cat litter daily greatly reduces the chances of infectious oocysts being present in litter. As infectious oocysts from cat feces can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> promptly after disposing of cat litter. The same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which should be covered when not in use.|$|E
25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that if, in the land, they found the body of a murder victim lying in the open, and they could not determine the killer, then the elders and judges were to measure the distances from the corpse to the nearby towns. The elders of the nearest town were to take a heifer that had never worked down to an ever-flowing wadi and break its neck. The priests were to come forward, and all the elders were to <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> over the heifer.|$|E

40|$|As {{delivery}} {{of medical care}} moves increasinglyto outpatient settings, patients who require hospitalization have more acute illness and height-ened susceptibility to nosocomial infections. Such infections result in substantial morbidity and are estimated to cause or contribute to 80 000 deaths annually in the United States (1).

25|$|Handwashing {{with soap}} {{consistently}} at critical moments {{during the day}} prevents the spread of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes. Handwashing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact. People can become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, {{if they do not}} <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. As a general rule, hand washing protects people poorly or not at all from droplet and airborne diseases, such as measles, chickenpox, influenza, and tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{promotion}} and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise {{awareness about the}} benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population. For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary. One example for handwashing promotion in schools is the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> with soap, among other hygienic requirements. When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. Building hand washing stations can be a part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.|$|E
25|$|Historical examples, {{such as the}} {{hookworm}} {{campaigns in}} Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 {{have shown that the}} primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children {{do not have access to}} clean water to <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.|$|E
