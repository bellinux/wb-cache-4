5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired.

Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> U.S. supermarkets.

5|$|In {{the last}} three years of the war, Coastal Command sank more U-boats than any other service and {{continued}} to hold the technological advantage from 1943.

Technological answers to the Type XXI <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the form of 3-centimetre radar and magnetic anomaly detectors in aircraft.
