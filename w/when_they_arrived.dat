5|$|Hamburg {{had once}} been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest in the world, but in 1943 {{virtually}} the entire city {{had been reduced to}} rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived,</b> the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city.|$|E

5|$|In May 1993, {{the band}} {{heard that a}} record {{executive}} from Creation Records would be scouting for talent at King Tut's in Glasgow. Together, they found the money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived,</b> they were refused entry to the club because no one notified the venue that Oasis had {{been added to the}} bill. The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder Alan McGee.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Waterloo {{station was}} chosen as the British {{terminus}} for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed because he said it was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon's defeat <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> in London by Eurostar. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d'Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon's greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived.</b> The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet was duly {{assembled}} {{in the spring of}} 499 BC, and sailed to Ionia. Artaphernes put his (and Darius's) cousin Megabates in charge of the expedition, and dispatched him to Miletus with the Persian army. They were joined there by Aristagoras and the Milesian forces, and then embarked and set sail. In order to avoid warning the Naxians, the fleet initially sailed north, towards the Hellespont, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> at Chios they doubled back and headed south for Naxos.|$|E

5|$|The Prussian {{army was}} {{in the throes of}} reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and Freikorps {{volunteer}} formations from the wars of 1813–1814 {{were in the process of}} being absorbed into the line, along with many Landwehr (militia) regiments. The Landwehr were mostly untrained and unequipped <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state. Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance– guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.|$|E

The entering forces, led by Bolesław, were ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and Vladimir's family: On 14 August, the city received Boleslav and Sventipolk , its long-absent lord. Thereafter, through his favour, and from fear of us, the whole region was brought into submission. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived,</b> the archbishop of that city received them, at the church of St Sophia, with relics of the saints {{and other kinds of}} ceremonial apparatus.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} Dutch units allied to the Germans present at Arnhem. These {{formations}} recruited from Dutch nationals (mainly criminals, men wishing to avoid national service or men {{affiliated with the}} Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging) and were incorporated into the German Army. At Arnhem, the partly Dutch SS Wachbattalion 3 was attached to Kampfgruppe Von Tettau and the 3rd Battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland training at nearby Hoogeveen was quickly attached to Harzer’s 9th SS Panzer Division <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> at the battle on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Thus, when Harun {{asked for}} negotiations, Irene {{dispatched}} {{a delegation of}} three of her most senior officials: the Domestic Anthony, the magistros Peter, and Staurakios himself. Confident of their military position, they neglected to secure promises for their safety or hostages of their own, so that <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> in the Arab camp, they were made prisoners. Coupled with the treachery of Tatzates and the unreliability of the troops under his command, Irene was now forced to negotiate for their release, especially of her trusted aide Staurakios.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} for assisting Zangi, the Abbasid authorities sought punitive measures against Ayyub. Simultaneously, {{in a separate}} incident, Shirkuh killed a close confidant of Bihruz on charges that he had sexually assaulted a woman in Tikrit. The Abbasid court issued arrest warrants for both Ayyub and Shirkuh, but before the brothers could be arrested, they departed Tikrit for Mosul in 1138. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> in Mosul, Zangi provided them with all the facilities they needed and he recruited the two brothers into his service. Ayyub was made commander of Ba'albek and Shirkuh entered the service of Zangi's son, Nur ad-Din. According to historian Abdul Ali, it was under the care and patronage of Zangi that the Ayyubid family rose to prominence.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
5|$|In March 1549, {{the city}} of Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius to leave.
