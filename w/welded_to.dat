5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E

5|$|The tank used in {{the film}} is a {{modified}} M5A1 Stuart. It was purchased from the government of Peru about twelve years prior to filming and had already been used in several films. Among numerous modifications made for Tank Girl, the tank's 37mm anti-tank gun {{was covered with a}} modified flag pole to give the appearance of a 105mm gun. An entire 1969 Cadillac Eldorado was added onto the tank, with the rear section welded at the back and the fender <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> the front.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E

5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks <b>welded</b> <b>to</b> the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

40|$|The {{propagation}} {{paths of}} ultrasonic waves through austenitic weld material {{are difficult to}} predict due to the anisotropic and inhomogeneous structure of the <b>weld.</b> <b>To</b> support an NDT-inspector a ray tracing algorithm has been developed to follow longitudinal, horizontal and vertical polarized shear wave propagation starting from the basic material through the anisotropic <b>weld</b> <b>to</b> the opposite side in forward or in backward direction. Grain orientation, elastic constants, insonification direction, mode conversions and probe sizes are entered into the program according to the experimental reults.

25|$|In 1934 {{the statue}} was {{returned}} to the college, where she was installed in the memorabilia room. She was subject to many failed attempts at theft (including by students from Amherst's rival Williams College) and several acts of vandalism, including a decapitation in 1941.

25|$|TRW {{originated}} in 1901 with the Cleveland Cap Screw Company, founded by David Kurtz {{and four other}} Cleveland residents.

Thompson adapted their process to making automobile engine valves, and, by 1915, the company was the largest valve producer in the United States. Charles Thompson was named {{general manager of the}} company, which became Thompson Products in 1926.

In Wollaston's battery, the wooden box was replaced with an earthenware vessel, and a copper plate was bent into a U-shape, with a single plate of zinc placed {{in the center of}} the bent copper. The zinc plate was prevented from making contact with the copper by dowels (pieces) of cork or wood.
