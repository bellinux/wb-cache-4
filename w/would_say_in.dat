500|$|She {{had kept}} mementos of Lennon for years, but began {{auctioning}} them off after his death, including a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her, which fetched £8,800 at Christie's in August 1981. [...] With her finances in an unsteady state – she <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> 1999 that [...] "Apart from John, the men I {{have fallen in}} love with have never been good at earning a living" [...] – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. [...] She said at the time, [...] "I've enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it's time for a change." [...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, [...] "I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's.

500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E

2500|$|In 1957 {{the station}} was once again sold, this time to the American Broadcasting Company-Paramount (ABC). During the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s KQV was quite {{successful}} as a top 40 station, with Count John K. Chapel a popular radio personality during most of this period. Known {{over the years as}} [...] "Colorful KQV," [...] "Audio 14," [...] "Groovy QV," [...] and [...] "The Big 14", KQV premiered its top 40 format on January 13, 1958, and is remembered for its high-profile, high-energy personalities, such as Robert Wolfson a.k.a. Bob Wilson, Chuck Brinkman, Hal Murray, Dave Scott, Steve Rizen, Dex Allen, Jim Quinn, future game show announcer Rod Roddy, and their large-scale promotion of a Beatles concert at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena in 1964.

2500|$|A vast {{majority}} of the 45 characters in the game possess their own unique accents and speech patterns. When lines were being recycled for a number of characters, instead of storing over 40 slightly different static variations of the same text and running into potential memory issues, the localization team adapted and expanded the Japanese version's auto-accent generator, to allow text to be converted into a dozen of variations that retain most of the features of the various characters. With this system, only one generic version had to be stored internally and shared by all characters. For example, the static text [...] "How are you?" [...] would be stored, but if spoken by an Australian character it would be changed to [...] "How are ya?"; if spoken by an Alien character it would appear as [...] "How aare yoou?" [...] Translator Richard Honeywood <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> retrospect that while the converter helped deal with memory constraints, creating and working with it was described as [...] "mind-boggling". The system did not work well with some more detailed scenes that required more context; these were treated as independent lines, retaining an original version of the dialogue for each character.|$|E

In the second round, the referee had {{gone so far as to}} penalize Joe two points for hitting below the belt. [...] "In a three-round bout a man can't afford a points deduction like that," [...] Joe would say. Joe then returned to Philadelphia feeling as low as he'd ever been and was even thinking of giving up boxing. Duke Dugent and his trainer Yank Durham were able to talk Joe out of his doldrums and even suggested Joe make the trip to Tokyo as an alternate, in case something happened to Mathis. Joe agreed and while there, he was a workhorse, sparring with any of the Olympic boxers who wanted some action. [...] "Middleweight, light heavyweight, it didn't matter to me, I got in there and boxed all comers" [...] Joe <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, Mathis was slacking off.

Johnson attempted to eliminate Marine Corps aviation entirely by transferring its air assets to the Navy and Air Force, and again proposed to progressively eliminate the Marine Corps altogether in a series of budget cutbacks and decommissioning of forces. Johnson ordered that the commandant be barred from attending Joint Chiefs of Staff meetings in his role of chief of service (including meetings involving Marine readiness or deployments), deleted him from the official roll of chiefs of service branches authorized a driver and limousine, and for whom a special gun salute was prescribed on ceremonial occasions.

The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr. Schwartz pulled it off, sneaking a truly smart show past the gatekeepers {{in the guise of}} something commercial and trashy and fun." [...] The reviewer also praised how the show [...] "steered clear of both Aaron Spelling-style camp and the soggy earnestness that often characterises teen drama" [...] and praised the integration of the adult cast into the plotlines. IGN called it [...] "far more engaging and interesting" [...] than its predecessors in the teen genre. The reviewer pointed to the show's sense of humor and respect for its audience, praising the series as [...] "very funny" [...] and [...] "well-acted", while referring to Mischa Barton as the weak link. Time Magazine critic James Poniewozik was fond of the premiere episode, saying that the show [...] "looks to have enough heart, talent and wit to generate a few seasons' worth of luxurious suds.

2500|$|President Richard Nixon made an unannounced {{visit to}} Xenia {{a few days}} later. It {{would be the first}} (and only) city {{affected}} by the 1974 Super Outbreak that he would visit. Upon inspecting the damage, he said: [...] "As I look back over the disasters, I saw the earthquake in Anchorage in 1964; I saw the hurricanes... Hurricane Camille in 1969 down in Mississippi, and I saw Hurricane Agnes in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. And it is hard to tell the difference among them all, but I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> terms of destruction, just total devastation, this is the worst I have seen." [...] President Nixon immediately declared Xenia a disaster area. Although the Federal Disaster Relief Act was already introduced in 1973, it still had not passed Congress. The 1974 Super Outbreak disaster was a catalyst for accelerated passage of the act through Congress in 1974, according to Nixon. It took several months for the city to recover from the tornado, {{with the help of the}} Red Cross and the Ohio National Guard assisting the recovery efforts. Most of the town was quickly re-built afterward. In recognition of their coverage of the tornado under difficult circumstances, the staff of the Xenia Daily Gazette won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting in 1975. The Xenia tornado was one of two rated F5 that affected Ohio during the outbreak, the other striking the Cincinnati area (see Cincinnati/Sayler Park area tornado, below). [...] Xenia was later struck by two other tornadoes—both a smaller one in April 1989 and a larger one in September 2000, which was an F4 twister that killed one and injured about 100 in an area parallel to and just north of the 1974 path. Before the 1974 storm, the city had no tornado sirens. After the F5 tornado hit on April 3, 1974, ten sirens were installed across the area.|$|E
