5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain {{good relations with the}} Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.|$|E
5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|During the Camillan era, {{they fought}} {{in a shallow}} phalanx formation, {{supported}} by light troops. In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: 'It comes down to the triarii' (res ad triarios venit), which meant carrying on to the bitter end.|$|E

60|$|All such phrases {{as these}} must appear {{of course to}} {{overstate}} the case. Pip {{is a much more}} delightful person than Nicholas Nickleby. Or to take a stronger case for the purpose of our argument, Pip is a much more delightful person than Sydney Carton. Still the fact remains. Most of Nicholas Nickleby's personal actions <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> show that he is heroic. Most of Pip's actions <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> show that he is not heroic. The study of Sydney Carton <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> indicate that with all his vices Sydney Carton was a hero. The study of Pip <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> indicate that with all his virtues Pip was a snob. The motive of the literary explanation is different. Pip and Pendennis <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> show how circumstances can corrupt men. Sam Weller and Hercules <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> show how heroes can subdue circumstances.|$|R

5|$|Final Destination is a 2000 American supernatural horror film {{directed}} by James Wong. It {{is the first}} installment of the Final Destination film series. The screenplay was written by James Wong, Glen Morgan, and Jeffrey Reddick, based on a story by Reddick. The film stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Tony Todd. Sawa portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a premonition of a catastrophic plane explosion. He {{and several of his}} classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but Death later takes the lives of those who <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> die on the plane.|$|E
5|$|Her {{green eyes}} <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> symbolize nature and {{also served as}} another {{contrast}} to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, architects Zaha Hadid and Ben van Berkel {{were invited}} to design and build two pavilions on the Chase Promenade South, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The pavilions were privately funded and were {{designed}} to be temporary structures. They served as {{the focal point of}} Chicago's year-long celebration of Burnham's Plan, and <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> symbolize the city's continued pursuit of the plan's architectural vision.|$|E

For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century. These stops <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes to properly blend into chamber music.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> have some of their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing any move. In the end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E

5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S. Marine Corps units) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The {{landings}} {{on the islands}} <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> deny their use by the Japanese as bases to threaten supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure the islands as launching points for a campaign with an eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.|$|E

5|$|Reviewing {{the quality}} of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese {{pictures}} are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his cityscapes. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the Governor General's Palace {{and the home of}} Raden Saleh. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that they <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of his images, particularly the portraits, were hand-tinted.|$|E
5|$|Rituals {{in honor}} of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these texts are found {{on the walls of}} temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> rouse Osiris—and thus the {{deceased}} person—to live again.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remodeling}} {{work on the}} Ellwood Mansion {{took place}} as the 19th century drew to a close. The changes, commissioned by Isaac Ellwood, <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> reflect more popular architectural styles including the Georgian and Colonial Revival. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more Classical elements. On the home's exterior, some of these changes {{can be observed in}} the addition of the portico and porte-cochere. Inside the home, the dining room was enlarged with the addition of the semicircular bay on the mansion's north facade.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the front}} of a proxy is {{revealed}} to the other players, it must be clear to everyone what it <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> substitute.

If two proxies <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> substitute different cards, they must be easily distinguishable by looking at their front side.Ideally, the label of a proxy should be enough to tell what it's <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> substitute. Alternatively, a legend or agreement can be used to prohibit players from changing these mappings during play.|$|R
