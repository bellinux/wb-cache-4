25|$|Plausible {{scenarios}} {{are easy to}} construct. Morton, measuring by seed, picks up a threateningly large black skull, fills it lightly and gives it a few desultory shakes. Next, he takes a distressingly small Caucasian skull, shakes hard, and pushes mightily at the foramen magnum <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb.</b> It is easily done, without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} cover shows the long-haired band members in dresses and makeup, and Cooper holding a cape around himself <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> sticking out {{to give the}} illusion of an exposed penis. [...] This led Warner Bros. to censor it—first that December by covering it with white strips, then by having the photo touched up with paint in pressings beginning in 1972. [...] Both front and back cover photos were taken by Roger Prigent, credited as [...] "Prigent". The gatefold features a close-up photo by Dave Griffith of Cooper's eyes heavily made-up with spidery eyelashes; in his pupils appear photos of the other band members.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{album cover}} featured the singer Cooper posed <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> protruding so {{it appeared to}} be his penis; Warner Bros. soon replaced it with a censored version. [...] The Love It to Death tour featured an elaborate shock rock live show: during [...] "Ballad of Dwight Fry"—about an inmate in an insane asylum—Cooper would be dragged offstage and return in a straitjacket, and the show climaxed with Cooper's mock execution in a prop electric chair during [...] "Black Juju". [...] Ezrin and the Coopers continued to work together for a string of hit albums until the band's breakup in 1974. [...] The album has come {{to be seen as a}} foundational influence on hard rock, punk, and heavy metal; several tracks have become live Alice Cooper standards and are frequently covered by other bands.|$|E
500|$|Hendrix favored overdriven {{amplifiers}} {{with high}} volume and gain. He {{was instrumental in}} developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock. He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb.</b> He applied this technique during the beginning bars of [...] "Little Wing", which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method {{has been described as}} piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand. Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing. He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings. [...] Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: [...] "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began." [...] Aledort wrote: [...] "In rock guitar, there are but two eras — before Hendrix and after Hendrix." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
2500|$|At a yell {{practice}} {{before the}} 1930 TCU game, A Board of Regents member Pinky Downs '06 shouted, [...] "What {{are we going}} to do to those Horned Frogs?" [...] His muse did not fail him as he improvised, borrowing a term from frog hunting. [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] he said as he made a fist <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> extended straight up. And with that the first hand sign in the Southwest Conference came into being. Interestingly, the [...] "Hook 'em Horns" [...] cheer was also invented by a UT cheerleader prior to the November 12, 1955 UT-TCU game. TCU wound up winning both of these historic games.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{generally}} two primary styles of rolling {{the ball down}} the lane. Most newer players play by rolling the ball straight, hopefully into the 1–3 pocket for right-handed bowlers or the 1–2 pocket for left-handed bowlers. More experienced bowlers usually roll a hook, {{which means that they}} make the ball start out straight and then curve towards the pocket. There are two ways to produce a hook. In the first, the player lets go of the ball <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> first, then the middle and ring finger release almost simultaneously. This gives the bowling ball its spin needed for the hook. If the player is right-handed, an ideal position of the thumb after letting go of the ball is [...] "10 o'clock", meaning that the thumb has gone from 12 to 10, as looking at a clock. The corresponding position for left-handed players is 2 o'clock. Of course, there are innumerable variations in style and technique and the position of the thumb can vary from person to person. The second way is to hold the ball without the thumb in the thumb hole. This uses one or two fingers to produce the hook. Some bowlers will use none of their fingers. Lab research has shown that the ideal shot will enter the pocket at an angle of 6 degrees with respect to the lane boards, which means that a straight ball should be thrown {{from the side of the}} lane, near the gutter.|$|E

2500|$|Mahal leads <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> {{and middle}} finger when fingerpicking, {{rather than with}} his index finger as the {{majority}} of guitar players do. [...] "I play with a flatpick," [...] he says, [...] "when I {{do a lot of}} blues leads." [...] Early in his musical career Mahal studied the various styles of his favorite blues singers, including musicians like Jimmy Reed, Son House, Sleepy John Estes, Big Mama Thornton, Howlin' Wolf, Mississippi John Hurt, and Sonny Terry. He describes his hanging out at clubs like Club 47 in Massachusetts and Ash Grove in Los Angeles as [...] "basic building blocks in the development of his music." [...] Considered to be a scholar of blues music, his studies of ethnomusicology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst would come to introduce him further to the folk music of the Caribbean and West Africa. Over time he incorporated more and more African roots music into his musical palette, embracing elements of reggae, calypso, jazz, zydeco, R, gospel music, and the country blues—each of which having [...] "served as the foundation of his unique sound." [...] According to The Rough Guide to Rock, [...] "It has been said that Taj Mahal {{was one of the first}} major artists, if not the very first one, to pursue the possibilities of world music. Even the blues he was playing in the early 70s – Recycling The Blues & Other Related Stuff (1972), Mo' Roots (1974) – showed an aptitude for spicing the mix with flavours that always kept him a yard or so distant from being an out-and-out blues performer." [...] Concerning his voice, author David Evans writes that Mahal has [...] "an extraordinary voice that ranges from gruff and gritty to smooth and sultry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E
