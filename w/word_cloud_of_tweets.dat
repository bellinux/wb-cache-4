40|$|Analyzing high-dimensional {{data and}} finding hidden {{patterns}} {{is a difficult}} problem and has attracted numerous research efforts. Automated methods can be useful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via interactive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data space into a continuum of generalized 3 D subspaces. Analysts can then explore these 3 D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface, but using additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded space comprehension. Since {{the number of such}} subspaces suffers from combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, and also helps them navigate within and across any higher-dimensional subspaces identified by clustering. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> attribute labels, sized according to the relevance of the associated data dimensions in the currently selected subspace. Finally, a view gallery helps users keep their bearings and return to interesting subspaces and views.

40|$|Objective – To learn {{whether a}} faceted {{catalogue}} and <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> {{aids in the}} discovery process. Design – User study. Setting – Large academic research library in the United States. Subjects – Twelve PhD candidates in the humanities, the majority of whom are engaged with researching, proposing, or writing their dissertations. Methods – The library’s entire catalogue of 5. 2 million records was loaded into the AquaBrowser OPAC search interface. A pilot study was conducted using three humanities graduate students employed by the library. Following the pilot, the main study was conducted using graduate students in the humanities. Graduate students {{in the social sciences}} were desired for the study, but were not able to be contacted due to time constraints. Once selected, the test subjects were asked to use an interface that offered both facets and tag clouds for enhanced search quality. Test subjects were allowed to choose the topic they would like to research; all chose to research their dissertation topic. A moderator and recorder facilitated research conducted with the faceted catalogue. The moderator ensured that students commented on their findings, cleared up any confusion with using the interface, and kept the students on task. Only when students remarked that a new discovery had been made were those discoveries noted. The impact to the discovery process of faceted navigation and AquaBrowser’s <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> was studied while the impact of relevance ranking was not. Main Results – The article asserts that results from both the pilot and main study were sufficiently similar to justify combining them for the paper, but the advantage that students employed by thelibrary might have over other students is not discussed. Nine of the twelve students used in the study found new results using the faceted catalogue and <b>word</b> <b>cloud.</b> The responses <b>of</b> the user group to the faceted catalogue and <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> were “overwhelmingly positive” (555). However, since students were allowed to move freely between the <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> and faceted navigation tool, it is difficult to attribute new discoveries solely to one or the other. However, when a new discovery could be “attributed primarily to one factor or another” (555) it was noted. The faceted navigation tool aided discovery at least four times and the <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> aided discovery at least six. Conclusion – A faceted catalogue interface with a <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> feature clearly aids in the discovery process for more advanced researchers — those with specialized subject knowledge, familiarity with their library’s collection, and experience in researching their area. However, facets and <b>word</b> <b>clouds</b> have limitations: records with limited cataloguing have little to offer faceted navigation; catalogue records from diverse providers introduce controlled vocabularies beyond LCSH and MeSH into searchreturns, resulting in the same word potentially appearing multiple times in the same return albeit with different meanings; the <b>word</b> <b>cloud</b> may contain certain words that researchers feel to be irrelevant. Despite these issues, the use <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>clouds</b> and faceted navigation (and relevance ranking) appears to be beneficial to research conducted by experienced subject searchers in the humanities...|$|R
