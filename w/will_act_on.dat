Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E

[...] Although he felt Avatar would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic, he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: [...] "If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film <b>will</b> <b>act</b> <b>on</b> them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience." [...] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant [...] "repeat business" [...] just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same [...] "sharing" [...] reaction as Titanic. He said that film worked because, [...] "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, [...] {{noted that}} the decisive {{military}} move by Russia was the first since the Soviet war in Afghanistan. The role played by Russia in the 1990s in overseeing the peace process transformed the separatist conflicts into a dispute between Georgia and Russia. Putin's desire to elevate Russia’s Great Power image was [...] "an important indicator of the motivations that guided the decision to engage in war with Georgia." [...] Rahman argued that [...] "Realism, the most dominant theory of International Relations, can be applied in analyzing Russian behavior in this war." [...] Rahman denied the claim that Russia’s action was defensive and retaliatory, explaining that long before the war, Russia had established the infrastructure and logistical support for a military invasion. Putin’s decision {{to engage in a}} war with Georgia was guided by geopolitical interests that Russia sought to advance through a decisive victory. The conflict would act as a deterrent against building any new pipelines from Azerbaijan to Turkey across Georgia. However, the war exposed Russia’s inability to accomplish political objectives without violence. Rahman argued that [...] "Russia’s negligence of the international organizations during the war also indicates the realist worldview of the Kremlin that Russia <b>will</b> <b>act</b> <b>on</b> its own if its interests clash with the desires of the international community." [...] He argued that [...] "both Putin and Saakashvili used identity politics and provoked ethnic/nationalist tensions that led to the outbreak of the war." [...] After the war, Putin became more popular and he was [...] "certainly very much in charge of his country, [...] more than ever." [...] Rahman summarized that [...] "the causes of the August war were indeed complex and multifaceted." [...] The failure of the West to deescalate the tension also contributed to the outbreak of the war.|$|E
