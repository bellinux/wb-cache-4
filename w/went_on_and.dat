5|$|Byrne {{assembled}} a band to tour for the album, performing music throughout {{the latter half}} of 2008 and early 2009 across NorthAmerica, Europe, and Australasia. He hired more singers than he had on previous tours to reproduce the complex vocal harmonies of the album and was inspired to bring along dancers after seeing SufjanStevens promote the album Illinois as well as the Japanese films FunkyForest and TheTasteofTea. Byrne was initially uninvolved in the choreography, but made more suggestions as the tour <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> after he saw a live performance by Deerhoof that incorporated dancing with instruments. He began booking tour dates before the album was completed and continued writing his book TheBicycleDiaries throughout the tour.|$|E
5|$|During May {{we had a}} weird game at Bristol v. Gloucester. We scored 200 for 1 wicket. W. G. then <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> took 5 wickets, and we {{were all}} out for 300. He then {{proceeded}} to go in first and help himself to 288, and to get his hundredth century. I had the satisfaction of giving him a full pitch to get to his hundred, not that he wanted any help.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} round in Europe, Hill again {{finished}} second behind Senna and ahead of a lapped Prost. In his first full season, Hill benefited {{from the experience of}} his veteran French team-mate. He continued to impress as the season <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> in San Marino Hill took the lead at the start, though he was passed by Prost and Senna and ultimately retired with brake failure. More bad luck struck him in Spain where he kept pace with Prost for most of the race only for his engine to fail.|$|E

5|$|Seattle {{was also}} the home base of {{impresario}} Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.|$|E

He <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> read many books on the subject, and planned to look for various deities. His parents found what Zhang was doing to be very unusual, so they required him to teach at other schools.|$|E

25|$|Tangerine Dream's {{earliest}} concerts were visually simple {{by modern}} standards, with three men sitting motionless for hours alongside massive electronic boxes festooned with patch cords {{and a few}} flashing lights. Some concerts were even performed in complete darkness as happened during the performance at York Minster, 20 October 1975. As time <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> technology advanced, the concerts became much more elaborate, with visual effects, lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, and projected images. By 1977 their North American tour featured full-scale Laserium effects.|$|E
25|$|The AstroTurf was {{replaced}} in 2000 {{by a system}} of interchangeable grass trays similar to those put in place for soccer, but was kept in place under the trays to aid in draining the field when it got wet. Over the next three years, the conditions would worsen as the season <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> the field quality was typically rated just as low as the old, hard AstroTurf had been. Giants Stadium finally scrapped the grass in favor of FieldTurf for the 2003 season, a surface which remained in place until the stadium closed.|$|E
25|$|In 1826 Dement {{took his}} first {{political}} office {{when he was elected}} sheriff of Franklin County. He <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> served the same area in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1828 to 1830. The General Assembly elected Dement state Treasurer in 1831, and he was reelected twice, until he resigned the post to serve in the General Assembly once again in 1836, as state representative from Fayette County, where the county seat of Vandalia was about to lose its position as capital of Illinois.|$|E

25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E
25|$|For {{almost two}} years the air war <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> losses mounted and the claims piled up. The {{statistics}} compiled for the 3d Bomb Wing was staggering. Suddenly in June 1953 the pace picked up with a full-scale max effort. Armament crew chiefs met the ships at night and readied the aircraft for early morning flights. Combat crews returned from missions, debriefed, and climbed back bleary-eyed and weary into their ships for early morning sorties. For two months this grueling routine was adhered to as schedule requirements rose.|$|E
25|$|The first Catholics came to Worcester in 1826. They were chiefly Irish {{immigrants}} {{brought to}} America by the builders of the Blackstone canal. As time <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> {{the number of}} Catholics increased, the community petitioned Bishop Fenwick to send them a priest. In response to this appeal, the bishop appointed the Reverend James Fitton to visit the Catholics of Worcester in 1834. Catholic mass was first offered in the city in an old stone building on Front Street. The foundation of Christ's Church, the first Catholic church in Worcester (now St. John's), was laid on July 6, 1834.|$|E

On May 17, 2011, Game announced via Twitter; he had just finished a conference call with Jimmy Iovine and Interscope Records, then he <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> officially confirmed the album would be officially released on August 23, 2011.

25|$|Sorin Socol is {{regarded}} by many good judges as the then {{best player in}} the current squad {{and was one of the}} rocks of the Romanian forward pack. He has captained the most matches to date for Romania, between 2003 and 2011. A total of 61 tests, 36 of them were as captain. He captained Romania for the first time on 30 October 2003 during the 2003 Rugby World Cup match against Namibia. He <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> featured in the 2007 World Cup squad and eventually retired from all international rugby after the 2011 tournament. Socol had one of Romania's highest winning percentage as a captain of 63.88.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Fringe {{faced the}} biggest crisis {{in its history}} when the {{computerised}} ticketing system failed. The events surrounding the failed box office software led to the resignation of Fringe Director Jon Morgan after only one full year in post. The resultant financial loss suffered by the Fringe Society was estimated at Â£300,000, which it was forced to meet from its reserves, although other sources report this at Â£900,000. These events attracted much comment from the UK and world media. More debts emerged as the year <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> an independent report criticised the Board and the current and previous Fringe Directors for a failure of management and an inability to provide the basic service.|$|E
