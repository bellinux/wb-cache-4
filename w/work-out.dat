25|$|Initially {{only part}} of the {{building}} was given to the school; in other parts there remained tenants, a separate music school, kindergarten, and a wind band. On 1 August 1935, the entirety of the building was given over to the secondary school. Year by year, the building was improved. During the 1937/38 school year the school received a gym, which was expanded to include dressing rooms and <b>work-out</b> rooms. When the gym was built {{at the back of the}} school's property, it abutted another outlying building belonging to the school. This small house, formerly used as teachers' quarters, and now home to the P.E. offices and a classroom, is also under historical preservation due to it being the birthplace of Dr. Kálmán Balogh, a famous Hungarian pharmaceutical scientist.

The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. New this season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa room would be featured in numerous subsequent seasons. Outside, there is a hot tub and pool, a billiards table and lounge area. The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps.

40|$|Abstract. The current paper {{describes}} {{research that}} is aimed to elucidate {{our understanding of}} technology factors that may help users of home exercise equipment to stay motivated for doing regular <b>work-outs.</b> In particular, we in-vestigated the effects of immersion and coaching by a virtual agent on intrinsic motivation {{and the sense of}} presence of participants cycling on a stationary home exercise bike. A basic two-by-two within-subjects experimental design was employed whereby participants were presented with a virtual racetrack with two levels of immersion (high vs. low) and two levels of a virtual coach (with vs. without). Results indicate a clear positive effect of immersion on both moti-vation and presence. The virtual coach significantly lowered the perceived con-trol and pressure/tension dimensions of intrinsic motivation, but did not affect the enjoyment dimension. The presence of the virtual coach also reduced nega-tive effects associated with VEs. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{estimating}} Loss Given Default (LGD) parameters using {{a workout}} approach, i. e. discounting cash flows over the workout period, the problem arises {{of how to}} take into account partial recoveries from incomplete <b>work-outs.</b> The simplest approach would see LGD based on complete recovery profiles only. Whilst simple, this approach may lead to data selection bias, which may be at the basis of regulatory guidance requiring the assessment of the relevance of incomplete workouts to LGD estimation. Despite its importance, few academic contributions have covered this topic. We enhance this literature by developing a non-parametric estimator that -under certain distributional assumptions on the recovery profiles- aggregates complete and incomplete workout data to produce unbiased and more efficient estimates of mean LGD than those obtained from the estimator based on resolved cases only. Our estimator is appropriate in LGD estimation for wholesale portfolios, where the exposure-weighted LGD estimators available in the literature would not be applicable under Basel II regulatory guidance. ...|$|R
