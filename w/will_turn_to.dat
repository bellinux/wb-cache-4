5|$|The Joes {{locate the}} secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three {{missiles}} with nanowarheads, which are aimed for Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, DC, the world's {{three most important}} cities. He intends {{to do this to}} strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet, after which they <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the person with the most power in the world, the President of the United States. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.|$|E

Once these questions are answered and biologists have a better sense of the amount of variation in RNA modification, the focus <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> each modification’s biological function. This has already been investigated in a select few proteins such as adenosine deaminase, which acts on RNA (ADAR). ADAR has been shown to affect antibody production and the innate immune system as well as transcripts encoding important receptors for the central nervous system. This plurality in function has caused some scientists to speculate that the epitransciptome may be even more expansive than the better defined epigenome.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Ireland, {{same-sex}} marriage is not recognised or performed, following several votes against {{it by the}} Northern Ireland Assembly. Same-sex marriages performed in Great Britain and across the world are recognised as civil partnerships in Northern Ireland. Citing the Legislature's constant refusal to approve a marriage bill and the law that recognises marriages {{from other parts of}} the United Kingdom as civil partnerships, local LGBT rights groups announced that they <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the courts for the right to wed. In January 2015, a couple who married in England and reside in Northern Ireland, filed a lawsuit to have their marriage recognised in the region. On 2 November 2015, the Northern Ireland Assembly voted for a fifth time on the question of legalising {{same-sex marriage}}. Of the 105 MLA's who voted on a motion to recognise same-sex marriage, 53 MLA's votes in favour and 51 voted against, the first time a majority of the assembly had ever voted in favour of same-sex marriage. However the DUP again tabled a motion of concern, preventing the motion from having any legal effect.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

Ahalya, though innocent, is turned to stone for sixty thousand years and destined to be redeemed only by Rama's touch. Ahalya accepts the verdict without debate. In another version in the same Purana, Gautama catches Indra fleeing as a cat and curses him with castration. Ahalya's plea of innocence is acknowledged by Gautama, who declares that her mind is pure and she has kept the [...] "vow of chastity and fidelity", but another man's seed has defiled her body. Gautama orders {{her to go to}} the forest and become a stone until rescued by the touch of Rama's feet. In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, when Indra reluctantly leaves, Gautama arrives and curses Ahalya to become a stone, to be later purified by Rama's feet. After she is freed from the curse, Gautama and Ahalya are reconciled and they spend their days in bed, exploring sexual techniques.|$|E
500|$|More than {{a century}} after his death, {{literary}} critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets. Yvor Winters claimed that [...] "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson". F. R. Leavis agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, [...] "When we read him we know, beyond question, {{that we have here}} a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really is criticism". Edmund Wilson claimed that [...] "The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism". The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson's work firmly within the Western canon, describing him as [...] "unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him...Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity, one that <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour." [...] It is no wonder that his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.|$|E

2500|$|Strain theory, {{also known}} as Mertonian Anomie, {{advanced}} by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the American Dream. Most people buy into this dream, {{and it becomes a}} powerful cultural and psychological motivation. Merton also used the term anomie, but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim. [...] Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve. [...] Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it.

2500|$|In November 1989, the Simon Wiesenthal Center {{asked the}} Estonian SSR's public prosecutor's office for any {{information}} regarding Männil, who they {{suspected of being}} a Nazi war criminal. In April 1990, Rein Sillar, the chief of Estonian SSR's KGB, replied {{that there was no}} evidence about Männil, and all possibilities for obtaining such evidence had been exhausted. In December 1993, Efraim Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, mailed a letter of complaint to Lennart Meri, the President of Estonia. He asked for Harry Männil to be removed from his position on the council of Baltic Institute for Strategic and International Studies. In reaction, Henry Kissinger – not wanting {{to be on the same}} council with a suspected war criminal – left the council in January 1994. Following a hearing by the United States government in the same year, Männil's United States visa was revoked. In January 1994, Männil wrote to the council's executive director: [...] "These accusations are completely groundless and untrue," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the judicial authorities of the Estonian Republic for an official investigation based on these accusations." [...] In 1995, Estonian investigators combed their files for evidence implicating Männil, but found none. Jüri Pihl, the director general of Kaitsepolitsei (Estonian Security Police), commented on Männil's case: [...] "Harry Männil has no connections to any war crimes committed in Estonia during the Second World War; there was nothing criminal in his actions." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Creatures' {{most famous}} and long-standing chant {{is known as the}} roll call. In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and their {{starting}} pitcher is getting ready to throw the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, Creature [...] "Bald" [...] Vinny Milano gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: [...] "Yo, Aaron!", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually {{in the form of a}} wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee and pointed at the Creatures with both hands) and Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant [...] "Box seats suck!" [...] During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of [...] "We've got beer!" [...] If the Yankees are playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant [...] "Boston sucks!" [...] until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting [...] "No fun allowed!", or nothing at all. If a non-pitcher is replaced in a defensive position, the replacement is given the same chant. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures will start another Roll Call just for fun. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant [...] "1918!" [...] and hold up signs saying [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!" [...] and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship.|$|E
