50|$|This is {{a fairly}} typical loricariid with a broad head and large mouth used for {{adhesion}} to rocks in fast-flowing <b>water.</b> <b>Colouring</b> is generally pale brown with darker blotches with standard length up to 10.5 cm. It can be distinguished from all its congeners by the anatomy of the dorsal fin: eight branched rays are present instead of seven {{and there is a}} membrane connecting the last ray {{to the back of the}} fish.|$|E
50|$|Mary Gartside (active 1781-1809) was an English water {{colourist}} and colour theorist. She published {{three books}} between 1805 and 1808. In chronological and intellectual terms Mary Gartside {{can be regarded}} an exemplary link between Moses Harris, who published his short but important Natural System of Colours around 1766, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s highly influential theory Zur Farbenlehre, first published in Germany in its complete form in 1810. Gartside’s colour theory was published privately under the disguise of a traditional <b>water</b> <b>colouring</b> manual. Until well into the twentieth century, she remained the only woman known to have published a theory of colour. She exhibited some of her own art work, paintings of flowers in watercolour, at the Royal Academy in 1781 and at the Associated Artists in Water-Color in London in 1808.|$|E

50|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{follower of}} his art, Penley published various elaborate treatises on its principles and practice, {{some of which}} are illustrated by chromolithography. Among them are his Elements of Perspective (1851), English School of Painting in <b>Water</b> <b>Colours</b> (1861), Sketching from Nature in <b>Water</b> <b>Colours</b> (1869), and A System of <b>Water</b> <b>Colour</b> Painting.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the work of Mary Gartside, a British female colour theorist, active in London between 1781 and 1808. She published three books between 1805 and 1808. In chronological and intellectual terms Gartside can cautiously be regarded an exemplary link between Moses Harris, who published a short but important theory of colour in the second half of the eighteenth century, and J. W. von Goethe’s highly influential Zur Farbenlehre, published in Germany in 1810. Gartside’s colour theory was published privately under the disguise of a traditional <b>water</b> <b>colouring</b> manual, illustrated with stunning abstract colour blots (see example above). Until well into the twentieth century, she remained the only woman known to have published a theory of colour. In contrast to Goethe and other colour theorists in the late 18 th and early 19 th century Gartside was less inclined to follow the anti-Newtonian attitudes of the Romantic movement...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the work of Mary Gartside, a British female flower painter, art teacher and colour theorist, active in London between 1781 and 1809. Gartside's colour theory was published privately {{in the guise of a}} traditional <b>water</b> <b>colouring</b> manual. Until well into the twentieth century, she remained the only woman known to have published a theory of colour. In chronological and intellectual terms Gartside can cautiously be regarded an exemplary link between Moses Harris and J. W. von Goethe. This paper takes a closer look at her colour theory in relation to earlier theorists she credits in her writing. It also suggests that certain elements of her theory may have pre-dated some of Goethe's ideas, thus being an indicator of changing attitudes to colour in the intellectual and artistic scene of Europe. Gartside's case is particularly interesting because it highlights gender issues with regard to publishing, self-promotion and the intellectual activity of women artists in the early nineteenth century...|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>colour</b> is {{currently}} increasing {{in thousands of}} lakes in the northern hemisphere due to an increased input of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and more specifically coloured disscolved humic matter (DHM). I studied how <b>water</b> <b>colour</b> affects the light climate in the epilimnion and, as a consequence, phytoplankton biomass, species composition and production in lakes in southern Sweden. In my first study, I found that epilimnion depth (ze) did not, contrary to my expectations, decrease with increasing <b>water</b> <b>colour.</b> Instead, ze increased when fetch (the distance wind can blow uninterrupted over a lake, calculated as the square root of lake area) increased, independently of <b>water</b> <b>colour.</b> Consequently, light intensities in the epilimnion were in general lowest in large lakes with high <b>water</b> <b>colour.</b> Values for average light intensities in the epilimnion (Ē%) suggested that light may be a limiting factor for phytoplankton in some lakes. This was confirmed in an experimental study, where small volumes of lake water were incubated at different depths in lakes. Decreasing light intensities, i. e. increasing incubation depths, led to decreasing phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) even when nutrient availability was sufficient to support higher biomasses. However, effects of <b>water</b> <b>colour</b> on phytoplankton species composition {{in this study were}} minor. In my third study, I investigated specifically differences between phytoplankton communities in lakes in a <b>water</b> <b>colour</b> gradient using phytoplankton pigments to identify groups of phytoplankton. Only one phytoplankton pigment, chlorophyll c 2 (affiliated with dinoflagellates, diatoms and chrysophytes), was affected directly by <b>water</b> <b>colour,</b> but Ē % and ze influenced the phytoplankton communities of the lakes. Finally, a mesocosm study revealed that primary production decreased with increasing <b>water</b> <b>colour.</b> In this study, increasing <b>water</b> <b>colour</b> was not accompanied by an increase in DOC, which explains why (bacterial) respiration did not increase as expected. If both production decreases and respiration increases as a consequence of increasing <b>water</b> <b>colour</b> in the future, lakes will become more heterotroph and thus emit more CO 2 to the atmosphere. This effect may be enhanced by increasing temperature. In my mesocosm study, I found that respiration increased with increasing temperature but production did not. There were also no interaction effects of warming and browning on production and respiration. In summary, the results from these studies imply that increasing <b>water</b> <b>colour</b> is likely to lead to lower phytoplankton biomass and production in lakes in southern Sweden in the future...|$|R
