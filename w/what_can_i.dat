5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> say to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E

But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|The first Led Zeppelin box set, {{featuring}} tracks remastered under Page's supervision, {{was released}} in 1990 and bolstered the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion. This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson's [...] "Travelling Riverside Blues". The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. 1992 saw {{the release of the}} [...] "Immigrant Song"/"Hey, Hey, <b>What</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> Do" [...] (the original B-side) as a CD single in the US. Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 {{was released in}} 1993; the two box sets together contained all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks.|$|E

500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E

It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times [...] "I am in too much grief to talk. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> say?" [...] After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.|$|E

World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

500|$|Bullet for My Valentine's debut album, The Poison, was {{released}} on 3 October 2005 in the UK and on Valentine's Day, 2006 in the US. It entered the Billboard 200 at number 128, and attained number 11 on the Independent Albums chart. On 30 January 2009, the album was certified gold by the RIAA after 500,000 copies were sold in the US. Four singles were released from The Poison: [...] "4 Words (To Choke Upon)", [...] "Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow (<b>What</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> Do)", [...] "All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)", and [...] "Tears Don't Fall." [...] Bullet for My Valentine promoted the album by touring across the world. In 2005, with increased popularity, they played on the larger Download Festival Snickers stage; in 2006, the band were moved to {{near the top of}} the main stage bill. Other tours included opening for Metallica and Guns N' Roses in the summer of 2006, the Vans Warped Tour and Earthday Birthday.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal played league challengers Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round, on 9 March 2002. The timing of the game, {{influenced}} by the television schedulers, angered Wenger, who threatened to field a weakened side, to prioritise on their Champions League progress: [...] "The BBC have put us in this position of playing at 5.35pm on Saturday night instead of a noon kick-off. I don't know whether Newcastle would have played the game earlier on the Saturday but <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do about the BBC? I feel it's being very unfair as {{we are the only}} side left in all three competitions." [...] It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, and in spite of Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle found [...] "new reserves of energy and determination" [...] to draw level and created numerous opportunities to win the game outright. With the game ending in a draw, a replay was scheduled two weeks later. Arsenal won 3-0, but more concerningly lost Pirès, who was carried off and subsequently ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick in the semi-finals was enough to send Arsenal to their 15th FA Cup final.|$|E
500|$|In late 1968, {{they began}} to record their first album and signed with Atlantic Records that afforded them {{considerable}} artistic freedom. Their first album, Led Zeppelin was released in early 1969. The album contained four cover versions and singer Robert Plant originally received no writing credits due to unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with CBS Records. Plant received writing credits on later editions of the album. Their second album, Led Zeppelin II, was released later that year in October. Against the band's wishes, the opening track, [...] "Whole Lotta Love", was released as a single in the US. However, the single was a commercial success, selling over one million copies and helped cement the group's popularity. Their third album, Led Zeppelin III, was released a year later in October 1970. The opening track, [...] "Immigrant Song", backed by the band's only non-album single, [...] "Hey, Hey, <b>What</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> Do", was released as a single in the US. Their fourth album was released on in November 1971 and was untitled {{partly due to the}} rather indifferent response drawn from Led Zeppelin III; the album is commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV. A huge critical and commercial success, the album contains some of the band's best-known songs, including [...] "Black Dog", [...] "Rock and Roll", [...] "Going to California" [...] and [...] "Stairway to Heaven", referred to {{as one of the greatest}} rock songs of all time, and helping secure the group's popularity.|$|E

[...] In [...] God set matters straight using the same two verb-stems: [...] "You shall not curse the people, for it is blessed."
