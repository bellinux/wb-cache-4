25|$|The proof above for {{the square}} root of two can be {{generalized}} using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This asserts that every integer {{has a unique}} factorization into primes. Using it <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> that if a rational number is not an integer then no integral power of {{it can be an}} integer, as in lowest terms there must be a prime in the denominator that does not divide into the numerator whatever power each is raised to. Therefore, if an integer is not an exact kth power of another integer then its kth root is irrational.|$|E
25|$|However, {{things are}} not quite that simple. The zero-point energy cannot be {{eliminated}} by dropping its energy from the Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous {{part of the solution}} for the field operator. In fact <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of QED. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.|$|E

25|$|Let Q(x,y) be {{the formula}} that relativizes P to L, i.e. all quantifiers in P are {{restricted}} to L. Q {{is a much more}} complex formula than P, but it is still a finite formula, and since P was a mapping over L, Q must be a mapping over V; thus we can apply replacement in V to Q. So {y | y∈L and there exists x∈S such that P(x,y) holds in L} = {y | there exists x∈S such that Q(x,y)} is a set in V and a subclass of L. Again using the axiom of replacement in V, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> that there must be an α such that this set is a subset of Lα ∈ Lα+1. Then one can use the axiom of separation in L to finish showing that it is an element of L.|$|E

[...] The New Orleans Daily Picayune surveyed the lengthy {{list of candidates}} and announced that [...] "the authors of The Bread Winners [...] will all meet at Chautauqua next summer". Another columnist suggested that a statistic {{be put in the}} next census for the number of people named as the author. The appearance of President Arthur's annual message to Congress in December 1883 caused the Rochester Herald to opine that he had written The Bread-Winners [...] "because a careful comparison of his message with the story shows many words common to both". Another Upstate New York paper, the Troy Times, evoked Parson Weems's tales of George Washington: [...] "We cannot tell a lie. [...] We wrote The Bread winners [...] with our own little hatchet. [...] If any one doubts it, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> him the hatchet." [...] This admission, the Buffalo Express felt, should {{put an end to the}} discussion.|$|E
500|$|Milk's {{role as a}} {{representative}} of San Francisco's gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President Gerald Ford, while visiting San Francisco, walked from his hotel to his car. In the crowd, Sara Jane Moore raised a gun to shoot him. A former Marine who had been walking by grabbed her arm as the gun discharged toward the pavement. The bystander was Oliver [...] "Bill" [...] Sipple, who had left Milk's ex-lover Joe Campbell years before, prompting Campbell's suicide attempt. The national spotlight was on him immediately. On psychiatric disability leave from the military, Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed. Milk, however, took advantage of the opportunity to illustrate his cause that public perception of gay people would be improved if they came out of the closet. He told a friend: [...] "It's too good an opportunity. For once <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> that gays do heroic things, not just all that ca-ca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms." [...] Milk contacted a newspaper.|$|E

The reviewer, too, objects to Bates's illustration of [...] "transition forms between Heliconius Melpomene and H. Thelxiope, which he thinks are no more different than [...] "a couple of Dorking hens". Bates's assumption that all forest animals are adapted to forest life is rejected by the reviewer, who sees the same features as signs of a beneficent Creator; while his mention of [...] "slow adaptation of the fauna of a forest-clad country throughout an immense lapse of geological time" [...] is criticised for being [...] "haunted" [...] by this [...] "spectre of time". However the reviewer is fascinated by the variety of life described in the book, and by Bates's [...] "rapturous manner" [...] of speaking about how delicious monkey flesh is, which [...] "almost puts a premium on cannibalism". The review concludes [...] "not without regret" [...] (at such an enjoyable book), and assures readers [...] "that they will not find him heavy reading"; supposes that 11 years was [...] "perhaps a little too much" [...] of tropical life; and recommends intending museum curators to try it for [...] "a year or two".|$|E
500|$|Mutchnick said Will was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not {{have a problem with it}} and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] McCormack was also the first actor to be cast. In response to the relationship between Will and Grace, McCormak said that gay men and straight women have [...] "more fun than anybody" [...] in their relationships; [...] "Straight guys like me are jealous because of how much fun they have. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> the audience part of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|This can {{be shown}} using the concept of left cosets of H in G. The left cosets are the {{equivalence}} classes of a certain equivalence relation on G and therefore form a partition of G. Specifically, x and y in G are related {{if and only if}} there exists h in H such that x = yh. If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> that all cosets of H have the same number of elements, then each coset of H has precisely |H| elements. We are then done since the order of H times the number of cosets is equal to the number of elements in G, thereby proving that the order of H divides the order of G. Now, if aH and bH are two left cosets of H, we can define a map f : aH → bH by setting f(x) = ba−1x. This map is bijective because its inverse is given by ...|$|E

2500|$|Stover {{helped develop}} a [...] "track in a box" [...] {{to see how}} {{simulated}} hoof impacts are affected by different surfaces. Stover said, [...] "In the laboratory, many new factors — for example, new surfaces and horseshoes — can be studied that optimize traction while reducing injury risk. Laboratory studies also control the environmental circumstances, thus avoiding the confounding of the results incurred by the multiple environmental variants in natural racetrack settings." [...] Roughly 50% of catastrophic breakdowns involve the fetlock joint, which connects the pastern and cannon bone. When a hoof strikes a racing surface, there is some slide, which helps reduce impact forces in excess of 10,000 Newtons but {{increases the risk of}} hyperextension of the joint. If the slide is too short, fractures of the first phalanx (P1) may result. This happens most frequently on turf and may be associated with studs on the horseshoe. On the other hand, Stover said that [...] "the more hyperextension the fetlock undergoes, the higher the stresses that are put on the structures that are failing. If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> that certain surfaces minimize hyperextension, they should minimize catastrophic injuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the now {{strained}} relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [...] and I have had some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it's picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There {{is a lot of}} interesting chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson's return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck between {{the two sides of the}} law. Jackson explained to The Huffington Post in 2009: [...] "I think my instincts towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke's son, and given Luke's ties to the mob, Lucky's seen the world from both sides. I don't think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray." [...] In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is where they go with it. Lucky has been doing a lot of that straight cop stuff. I think if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>show</b> the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: [...] "Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he's doing stuff like that. They've had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it'd be nice to pair them up." ...|$|E
