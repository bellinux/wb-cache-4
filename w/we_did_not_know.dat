When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know,</b> and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> it.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Alonso Ruizpalacios, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, gathering 300 fans who responded to an invitation posted by Lafourcade in social networks. The singer asked her fans to send a thought inspired by the song or a personal story derived from their identification with [...] "Hasta la Raíz". [...] "I thought that we would get few answers, but received almost 800 responses immediately, and later {{it turned into a}} riot and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if they would get out of control, but nothing happened, my fans are super cool," [...] Lafourcade told Variety Latino. In the video, shot in black and white, Lafourcade is surrounded by several people who lead her to a stage to perform {{the last part of the}} song, in the meantime, Lafourcade throws flowers in the air, kisses a guy and plays a guitar. According to Milly Contreras of Latin Post the video [...] "shows off the singer's individuality and simplicity" [...] and included it at number 7 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Music Videos of 2015".|$|E

[...] Israel reserved {{the right to take}} action against targets preparing attacks against it during the 48-hour period, an Israeli official said. [...] Other officials called the attack a tragic mistake. Israel also arranged with U.N. officials to allow safe passage for 24 hours so residents of southern Lebanon can flee the region.

2500|$|Later, in July, the 4th Brigade {{took part}} in the {{fighting}} around Le Hamel. The tactics used during the battle on 4 July 1918 were conceived by General John Monash and largely carried out by Australian infantrymen, along with a number of US troops. It was the scene of one of Allies greatest military victories during the war. So great was this victory that French prime minister Georges Clemenceau came to address the Australian troops in the field: [...] "When the Australians came to France, the French people expected a great deal of you, but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that from the very beginning you would astonish the whole continent". On 12 August 1918 Monash was knighted in the field by King George V.|$|E
2500|$|General {{reaction}} to the verdict was one of shock and amazement. [...] In response to public {{reaction to}} the quick verdict, the jury issued a statement saying, [...] "We were present during the entire time of the trial, we heard everything that was said and saw everything that {{was done in the}} courtroom and heard nothing of what was being done and said outside, hence when we had agreed upon a verdict <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> of anything to keep us in the jury room longer." [...] A misunderstanding of the jury instructions may have also {{played a role in the}} verdict. [...] The jury's understanding of the instructions was that they were required to find all of defendants guilty in order to convict and as they could not agree that all eight were involved they felt required to return a not guilty verdict.|$|E

"I {{live for}} today, {{but it is}} nice {{sometimes}} to look back to yesterday. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that we were living through an era - the Big Band Era - that would last only 10 years or so and be remembered and revered for ever...it's hard to believe, but the best times were packed into a five-year period from the late 1930s through the early 1940s when I sang with the bands of Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and Harry James. The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into {{a couple of years}} from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country. It didn't last long, but it sure was something while it lasted. Everyone should have something like it at least once in their lives. I'm grateful I did." [...] - Helen Forrest (circa 1982) ...|$|E
2500|$|David Lewis relates “Although we {{had been}} counseled by Joseph the Prophet to leave the mill and go to Far West, but being deceived by the {{messenger}} we sent him for council, we understood it not, for our messenger said to Joseph what shall we do {{that is at the}} mill, Joseph said gather up all of you and come to Far West. [...] "What?" [...] said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, [...] "leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it." [...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E
2500|$|The seed of {{the woman}} is predestined to eternal life and the seed of the serpent to damnation. There is neither choice nor chance in this. It was God's purpose from the {{foundation}} of the world. If <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> this of God, we would know nothing of God and would attribute everything to our own natures. [...] "Here reason keeps a great clamour, and saith, doth God make man to damn him?" [...] Tomkinson replies with the old story of the pots discussing their potter. Thus, repentance is a sign of God's grace working, not what calls forth the grace in the first place. People are not their own saviours because their efforts are always inadequate to the task. Those who live by good works and piety will get only the rewards of the law. On the other hand, what is in a person's heart is put there by God. Reason is at a loss here because it seems that God's requirements are so demanding, no one could satisfy them. Tomkinson retorts, [...] "But what has God taken from you that has so weakened you?" [...] Which is why Jesus came to call sinners, not the righteous. He gives the example of Mary Magdalen.|$|E

2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how we would land." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{returning}} to New York City in January 1937, Schneider {{claimed he was}} never paid in full. Spain claimed that they were paid in full, and were not owed any money. Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said [...] "This was a mess... and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> who we were fighting and why, and you can say that we are damn glad to be back."

40|$|How {{does the}} skeptic {{arrive at the}} {{conclusion}} that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> anything about the external world? According to the standard story, the skeptic starts with a particular radical skeptical hypothesis, such as that we are brains-in-vats, and argues that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that it is false; she then uses the principle that knowledge is closed under known entailment to show that since <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that the skeptical hypothesis is false, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that an arbitrarily chosen proposition about the world, such as that we have hands, is true. Since the argument applies to any proposition about the world, the skeptical conclusion is that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> anything about the world. This is of course a simplified story, for it leaves out the part played by the concept of epistemic justification. This paper will discuss a problem concerning {{this part of the}} story that is crucial to understanding epistemological skepticism, a problem that has never been adequately addressed. I will first argue that skepticism about knowledge (of the world) requires skepticism about justification (of our beliefs about the world) {{if it is to be}} understood as a real threat to human knowledge rather than as merely presenting us with a paradox.
