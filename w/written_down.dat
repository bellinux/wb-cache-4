5|$|It {{is known}} that during the Parthian period the court {{minstrel}} (gōsān) recited poetic oral literature accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed in verse form, were not <b>written</b> <b>down</b> until the subsequent Sasanian period. In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form, since it was <b>written</b> <b>down</b> in the following centuries. It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale Vis and Rāmin and epic cycle of the Kayanian dynasty {{were part of the}} corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later. Although literature of the Parthian language was not committed to written form, there is evidence that the Arsacids acknowledged and respected written Greek literature.|$|E
5|$|Local tradition, first <b>written</b> <b>down</b> by John Leland in 1542, {{holds that}} Cadbury Castle was King Arthur's Camelot. The {{site and the}} Great Hall are extensive, and the writer Geoffrey Ashe argued {{in an article in}} the journal Speculum that it was the base for the Arthur of history. His opinion has not been widely {{accepted}} by students of the period.|$|E

40|$|In {{mathematical}} instruction, {{problem solving}} {{in a real}} life is usually actualized in form of word problems. In fact however the student’s ability in word problems is very poor. The low of student ability is shown {{with the number of}} errors they made. Hence error analysis needs to do to know where the students make mistakes. The method {{that can be used to}} analyze student’s errors is Newman’s Error Analysis (NEA). There are five steps in Newman’s Error Analysis Method, they are: reading, comprehension, transformation, process skill, and encoding. This study is aimed to describe: (1) errors that very often done by students in solving word problems, and (2) forms of error done by students in solving word problems. The study is a quantitative descriptive research. The study was implemented to students of SMP Muhammadiyah 06 DAU Malang grade of VIII-A. The data collection used test and interview. The data analysis used descriptive analysis to the forms of student’s error. While the simple statistical analysis is used to level of errors made by students in solving word problems in Newman’s prompt. The result of study shown that errors which very often done by students in solving word problems placed in encoding step. The errors in reading step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the meaning of word/phrase unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the meaning of word/phrase that is not very clear, give meaning of word/phrase incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the meaning of word/phrase at all. The errors in comprehension step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given components incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given components briefly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given and asked components incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given and asked components at all. The errors in transformation step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the method unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the method incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the method at all. The errors in process skill step are: doing computation in wrong method, doing errors in computation, doing misconception, not continuing the procedure of solution, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the procedure of solution. The errors in encoding step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding in properer unit, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding properly, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding at al...|$|R

5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first <b>written</b> <b>down.</b> The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of the foundational texts of Jainism.|$|E

5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds.

According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born Henricus, who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were <b>written</b> <b>down,</b> {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist WilliamP. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{produced}} extensive {{poetry in}} Old English, {{some of which}} was <b>written</b> <b>down</b> {{as early as the}} 9th century, although most surviving poems were compiled in the 10th and early 11th century. Beowulf, probably written between 650 and 750, is typical of these poems, portraying a vivid, heroic tale, ending with the protagonist's death {{at the hands of a}} dragon, but still showing signs of the new Christian influences in England. Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards, including translations of popular foreign works, including The Pastoral Care.|$|E

5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once <b>written</b> <b>down</b> explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
5|$|The Mahavira's teachings were {{gradually}} lost after around 300BC, {{according to}} the Jain tradition, when a severe famine in the Magadha region of ancient India caused a scattering of the Jain monks. Thereafter, attempts were made by Jain monks to gather again, co-recite the canon, and re-establish it in its entirety. These efforts identified differences between recitations of the Mahavira's teachings, and {{an attempt was made}} in the 5thcentury AD to reconcile the differences. However, the reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions continuing with their own incomplete, somewhat different versions of the Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were <b>written</b> <b>down</b> in palm leaf manuscripts.|$|E
