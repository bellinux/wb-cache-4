5|$|During {{its early}} days of settlement, the Lower Clarence {{district}} lacked roads; virtually all communication within the area and {{with the outside world}} depended upon <b>water</b> <b>transport.</b> Lower Clarence settlers were by necessity good oarsmen, and several of them became national and even world champion scullers. Rush, who in his prime was over six feet tall and weighed 13 stone, soon distinguished himself as a powerful 'puller'. He rowed the heavy settlers’ boats, also known as 'butcher boats' delivering meat to Clarence River customers. By 1866, Rush was competing in various regattas regularly held among the riverside settlements of Ulmarra, Lawrence, Brushgrove and Rocky Mouth.|$|E
5|$|From 1800 to 1847, Banagher {{enjoyed a}} period of {{prosperity}} unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long {{been one of the}} chief agricultural activities of the district and the opening of the Grand Canal {{at the end of the}} 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area round the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, {{the state}} began {{construction}} on the Wabash and Erie Canal. The canal was started at Lake Erie, passed through Fort Wayne, and connected to the Wabash River. This new canal made <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> possible from New Orleans to Lake Erie on an internal route rather than sailing around {{the whole of the}} Eastern United States and entering through Canada. Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new-type heat-insulating <b>water</b> <b>transporting</b> {{vehicle is}} {{designed}} {{to solve the problem}} that <b>water</b> <b>transported</b> in cold area is apt to be frozen. The vehicle shall be actively heated and passively heat-insulated with fuel oil heater and polyurethane insulation layer. Furthermore, it also can be automatically heated with the special management system by controlling the heater according to the water temperature and the ambient temperature. In order to study on the heat-insulation property of the vehicle, the temperature distribution of the water in the tank and heat losses from the tank with ANSYS; finally, the low temperature environmental test is carried out. The test result shows that the water temperature in the tank is reduced from 20 ℃ to 19 ℃ for 24 h under ambient temperature of- 25 ℃, the average overall heat transferring coefficient is 0. 52 W/(m 2 •K) and thus completely meets requirements for <b>water</b> <b>transporting</b> in cold areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{seasonal}} mean atmospheric {{precipitable water}} and <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport</b> over the Haihe River Basin (HRB) in North China {{with a focus}} on their interannual to interdecadal variability, and then the relationships of the interannual and interdecadal variability of the water cycle over the HRB to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena were investigated using the observational and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data. There was a strong interdecadal variability for the water cycle (such as precipitation and <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport)</b> over the region, with an abrupt change occurring mostly in the mid 1970 s. The intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon largely affected the atmospheric <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport.</b> Generally, the net meridional convergence of the water vapor flux over the region was relatively large before 1965, and it declined gradually from then on with a further notable decrease since mid 1970 s. Zonal <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport</b> was similar to meridional, but with a much smaller magnitude and no noteworthy turning in the mid 1970 s. Results also suggested that the wind field {{played an important role in}} the <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport</b> over the HRB before the mid 1960 s, and the interdecadal variability of the water cycle (precipitation, <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport,</b> etc.) in the summer was related to the PDO; however, interannual variation of the <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport</b> could also be related to the ENSO phenomena...|$|R

5|$|Modern {{maritime}} trade routes – {{sometimes in the}} form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. Inland <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
40|$|Latitudinal {{variations}} in images of Saturn's disk, upper atmospheric temperatures, and ionospheric electron densities {{are found in}} magnetic conjugacy with features in Saturn's ring plane.

40|$|Abstract The {{characteristics}} of spring precipitation and <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport</b> in South China {{were analyzed by}} using observational data and the National Centers for En-vironmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data. The re-sults show that, during the spring, each component of the water cycle (precipitation, wind field, specific humidity, <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport,</b> etc.) in South China exhibits a no-table interdecadal variability. An abrupt increase in spring precipitation occurred in the early 1970 s. During the dry period from 1958 to 1971, a water vapor flux divergence (positive divQ) existed in South China, which {{may have led to}} the deficiency in rainfall. However, during the wet period from 1973 to 1989, there was a remarkable water vapor flux convergence (negative divQ) in South China, which may have resulted in the higher rainfall. The inter-decadal variability of <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport</b> is closely re-lated to the interdecadal variability of wind fields, al-though the interdecadal variability of specific humidity also plays a role to some extent, and the interdecadal variability of the zonal <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport</b> contributes much more to the interdecadal variability of spring pre-cipitation than the meridional <b>water</b> vapor <b>transport...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{major problem}} was the weather. The monsoon caused rough seas that precluded {{the use of the}} small Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVPs) and {{restricted}} the operations of the larger LCMs. Because of the extremely rough seas—the most difficult that the 532nd EBSR had ever encountered—most supply missions were by night when tidal conditions were most favourable. Wootten insisted that at least seven days' supplies be available in forward areas in case the weather prevented the LCMs from running. II Corps made available two trawlers, manned by the 1st <b>Water</b> <b>Transport</b> Group, to deliver rations. The Australian Army also moved supplies by DUKWs.|$|E
5|$|Air {{support was}} {{provided}} by No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, which included several Royal Australian Air Force squadrons such as No. 4 Squadron RAAF, flying CAC Boomerangs and Wirraways, and No. 24 Squadron RAAF equipped with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers; these units undertook numerous close air support and resupply missions throughout the campaign. American Republic P-47 Thunderbolts and Lockheed P-38 Lightnings from the 348th and 475th Fighter Groups were also used to provide fighter cover for Allied shipping, while heavy and medium bombers from the Fifth Air Force carried out strategic bombing missions to reduce Japanese airbases around Wewak and New Britain, and raided Japanese lines of communication in concert with PT boats. Due to the impracticalities of using wheeled transport in the jungle, Allied logistics was undertaken primarily by means of <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> such as landing craft and barges which moved supplies along the coast, with overland supply to combat units being completed by New Guinean labourers and, at times, by Australian combat troops themselves, which were re-roled temporarily to undertake portage tasks as required, and augmented where possible with jeeps.|$|E
5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> and steamboat {{traffic in}} Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his land purchase primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another joining the west coast, which directly led to the domination of the tourist and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E

5|$|As had {{happened}} during the Kokoda Track campaign and the Battle of Buna–Gona, estimates by Australian intelligence differed greatly from those at GHQ, as they used different methods. The intelligence staff at Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ), headed by Brigadier J. D. Rogers, {{had come up with}} a much higher figure of 3,000. I Corps produced an estimate of 1,800, which was passed on along with GHQ's estimate. The Allies' best source of intelligence, Ultra, shone no light on the matter. Finschhafen was mentioned in only five decrypted messages in the previous three months. Most of these were in the insecure Japanese <b>Water</b> <b>Transport</b> Code. Only after the capture of Japanese codebooks in the Battle of Sio in January 1944 were the Allies able to systematically break into the Japanese Army codes. In fact, Japanese strength in the area on 22 September was about 5,000.|$|E
5|$|Farming villagers in {{the north}} spent their days {{harvesting}} crops like wheat and millet, while farmers south of the Huai River engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised. The cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the Yangzi River; even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops. Some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo. Besides cutting down trees to sell wood, the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal, and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots, and weaving mats and baskets. In the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common, while in the south the myriad of rivers, canals, and lakes provided cheap and easy <b>water</b> <b>transport.</b> Although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers, there were on average many more owner-cultivators north of the Huai River due to harsher climate, living not far above subsistence level.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese also {{relied upon}} <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> for {{logistics}} during the battle. Due to heavy shipping losses {{earlier in the}} year during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, they employed a small force of submarines in an effort to avoid Allied air attack. Closer to the battle zone, barges were used to augment these submarines, but they too proved vulnerable to attack by Allied aircraft and PT boats. The distribution of Japanese supplies was hampered by the lack of native carriers, which the Japanese had been unable to recruit due to an Allied propaganda campaign in the region. In addition, {{there was a lack of}} motor transport and the track system was under developed. As a result, distribution of supplies once they had been landed was undertaken by resupply parties which were drawn largely from combat units. These parties moved overland on foot using a number of key tracks that existed north of the Wareo–Gusika ridge.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{arrived at}} Shannon Harbour in 1804, and the <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> {{facilities}} stimulated {{the growth of}} existing industries and encouraged the establishment of new ones. Neat two and three-storey houses were built {{on each side of}} the road in Banagher to provide shops and dwellings for the merchants and other people who came to live there for the canal business. In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a malthouse and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and in their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of witches and demonic forces {{was taken for}} granted by the American colonists—witchcraft was considered {{the work of the}} Devil. Colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior. As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the Jamestown colony, a grand jury in Virginia sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witch—she had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record of the outcome is extant. Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience events of mass hysteria such as the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials in 1692–1693, in which 19people were executed on allegations of sorcery, some years before the first accusations against Sherwood. Ecclesiastical influence in the courtroom was much less a factor in Virginia, where the clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials, than in New England, where ministers took an active part. People's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in folklore, although the two often intermingled. New England's Puritans had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, connected by <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> and scattered over a large area.|$|E
