500|$|That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> is {{the debut}} EP of the American electronic-music project Games, {{consisting}} of producers Daniel Lopatin and Joel Ford. Lopatin and Ford (who had made electronic music together since their school days) produced That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> {{in an apartment}} studio, using vintage synthesizers and sequencers to recapture the sound and style of 1980s power pop.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Games {{stated that}} That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> would be {{released}} in late September or early October 2010. However, when the release date and track list were announced on September 9 the release date had been pushed back to November 2. The EP, distributed by Hippos in Tanks with cover artwork by Christian [...] "Megazord" [...] Oldham and cover design by Rasmus Emanuel Svensson, was positively received by critics. In a November 3, 2010 review Steve Shaw praised That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> for its accurate references to 1980s music, writing that the EP [...] "resides in a both unsettled and an unsettling state, with hints of something very strong and unique perhaps being tied down by exploring more recognisable formats". Shaw recommended it to his readers, giving it a rating of four out of five. In a Boston Globe review Michael Brodeur described the EP as [...] "unrelentingly retro, but intriguingly interstitial", with a smoothness which [...] "sounds like a familiar future". Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media called That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> [...] "a quirky and technical treat" [...] but criticized the EP's brevity, lamenting the omission of previous Games singles [...] "Everything Is Working" [...] and [...] "Heartlands". That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> was ranked eighth on Gorilla vs. Bear's list of the top 30 albums of 2010; according to Chris Cantalini, [...] "The run time here is slight, but the EP's brevity works in its favor, as there's not a wasted second on this thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The writing, {{recording}} and mixing of That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> {{is rooted in}} 1980s power pop. On a technical level, according to Steve Shaw of Fact magazine, Games's instrumentation includes everything expected in 1980's music and is executed correctly: bass lines, strings, keytar and arpeggiators. Instead of merely reproducing the sound from that era, the band pushes the music into unfamiliar territory. According to Pitchfork Medias Joe Colly, the EP has a nostalgic sound – due, in part, to the analog synths ("not just vintage but almost aged" [...] instrumentation) and their [...] "glitchy electro jams." ...|$|E

500|$|That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> {{contains}} six songs, {{including four}} original Games tracks (one, the opener [...] "Strawberry Skies", with vocals by Laurel Halo). It also has two remixes: a remix of [...] "Strawberry Skies" [...] by the Chicago duo Gatekeeper and a reprise {{of a song}} by Canadian musician CFCF. The EP, released in November 2010 on the Hippos in Tanks label, was promoted with music videos and singles. It was well received by critics, who appreciated the duo's use of its 1980s power-pop influences, and made the top ten of MP3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear's year-end list.|$|E
500|$|That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> also {{includes}} two remixes; Chicago duo Gatekeeper's version of [...] "Strawberry Skies" [...] contains {{a sample of}} the PlayStation start-up sound and, according to Fact Steve Shaw, [...] "ups the '80s ante and slows the pace with their trademark industrial sex club character (sampling Boards of Canada in the process), the result sounding far more like a real computer game than any of the UK club tracks currently referencing them". The EP ends with Games's version of CFCF's [...] "It Was Never Meant to Be", which Shaw described it as a [...] "lush affair" [...] with [...] "chopped DX7 pads and afro-new age staccato melodies".|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} {{released}} from That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> was [...] "Midi Drift", which was posted on Games's blog in April 2010. [...] "Shadows in Bloom" [...] premiered on the MP3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear and Pitchfork Media Altered Zones website on September 29, 2010. On December 14, a remix of [...] "Strawberry Skies" [...] by electronic musician Hudson Mohawke (not {{included on the}} EP) became available for download on Fact website; according to the magazine, it [...] "manages to be totally malevolent while also sounding like an amazing street party, which is quite an achievement". A Stereogum writer called the Hudson Mohawke remix [...] "nice", but preferred Gatekeeper's [...] "strangulation" [...] of the song.|$|E

He got a response from Universal that said King was fascinated by his music, which Salinas found hard to believe. He met King at the soundcheck and King said, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>can</b> <b>play</b> the last song, and if people like it <b>we</b> <b>can</b> keep <b>playing</b> some more". They ended up playing four more songs.|$|R

500|$|That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> was {{recorded}} {{with a single}} stereo Pro Tools track and [...] "outboard, secondhand vintage synths and sequencers". Ford explained {{the process of making}} each song in an interview with XLR8R: [...] "It's almost like we just sit down with gear and are like, 'Whoa, this sounds sweet,' and then we'll make a beat, and be like, 'What if we do this?' and something comes out and we move from there. Where it gets really complex—and you can't be a slacker—is you have to inventorize all these tiny sounds and constantly be trying to fit all of these moving parts together and see what sticks—and it's a lot of repetitive, careful-listening kind of work." ...|$|E
500|$|The third track, [...] "Planet Party", called [...] "Apple IIe funk" [...] by Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media, {{contains}} [...] "wailing guitar synths", [...] "fist-pumping bass", [...] "scattergun freestyle drums" [...] and [...] "sudden, surprisingly violent orchestral stabs". Produced in {{the summer}} of 2010 and the first song to be chosen for inclusion on That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play,</b> Ford recalled, [...] "We were making this smooth-rock, Alan Parsons Project-style shit, and then it completely got sliced and diced, mistakes happened in Pro Tools, and it became something else." [...] "Shadows in Bloom", a reprise of [...] Secret Service's [...] "Flash in the Night", is a melancholy, mid-tempo power ballad featuring bass, snare and synth harmonies described by a reviewer as violent, cavernous, and harsh.|$|E
500|$|Spin {{magazine}} {{described the}} Pixies' musical style as [...] "Surf music-meets-Stooges spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics". Their music {{has also been}} pictured as [...] "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums." [...] The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, [...] "Those are the two basic components of rock music... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't {{know how to do}} anything else. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>play</b> loud or quiet—that's it".|$|E

500|$|That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> {{was also}} {{promoted}} with several music videos. A video for [...] "Planet Party" [...] {{was released on}} Delicious Scopitone in August 2010, which Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media described as [...] "a stutteringly smooth, been-around-for-a-few-minutes" [...] production with [...] "jet skis, killer whales, water slides, wind surfing, track racing, and tape-warped women". A video for [...] "Shadows in Bloom" [...] by WEIRDCORE was released on November 11 and, according to Fitzmaurice, [...] "showcases a warped take on airline attendants and air travel {{that has to be}} seen to be believed." [...] On December 13 a video for [...] "Strawberry Skies", directed by Josef Kraska and described by Gorilla vs. Bear as an 80s chat line-shower montage", premiered on the blog.|$|E
500|$|That <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Play</b> opening track, [...] "Strawberry Skies", {{the only}} {{cut on the}} release that was {{produced}} in a real studio, {{was inspired by the}} theme of the American television show Law & Order. Critics compared it to Bananarama's [...] "Cruel Summer". The track features dream-like vocals by Laurel Halo, mixed with reverb; according to Fact, it reflects the [...] "cloud-like" [...] sounds of previous releases by Oneohtrix Point Never. In writing the lyrics to the song, Ford and Lopatin came up with several senseless phrases in writing the melody for the lead vocal, the former saying that he [...] "made them about Shaq and Kobe and eating steak sandwiches and pies," [...] and the latter saying [...] "Anything just to get the sounds." [...] "Strawberry Skies" [...] is followed by [...] "MIDI Drift", which features an Italo bass line, [...] "pitch-bent keytar" [...] and [...] "square wave synths", and was compared by Michael Brodeur of The Boston Globe to the music of Ratatat.|$|E

Atkins, with his greatcoat on ready to go home, {{made no attempt to}} refute this analytical masterpiece but merely remarked with great deference: [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>play</b> it quite like that!" [...] and then beat a craven retreat [...] "escorted by Club Officials".|$|E
2500|$|Although Team USA {{would win}} all eight {{games in the}} 1996 Olympics, with the closest game being a 15-point victory over Japan, VanDerveer was not certain of victory, even as the team was {{en route to a}} 52–0 pre-Olympic record against college and {{national}} teams. After beating the Cuban national team on May 26, 1996, in Townsville, Australia, the team record reached 44–0. In their next game against the Ukraine national team, played in Adelaide on May 14, the USA team won again, but VanDerveer was not happy. Ukraine, at full strength, was not {{the best team in the}} world, and was not seen to be as strong as Russia or Brazil. Moreover, Ukraine was expected to add better players before the Olympics, yet the USA team won by only 11 points, 62–51. VanDerveer recalled worrying at the time: [...] "There's no way <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>play</b> like this and win a gold medal." ...|$|E
