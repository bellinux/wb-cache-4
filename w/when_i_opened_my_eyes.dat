500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> the room was spinning." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Trot, my dear,' she said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> 'I couldn't {{make up my}} mind {{to disturb}} you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> little valise, {{before going}} to bed, I saw the box the doctor's {{daughter}} had given me.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> {{bedroom door}} the next morning, the widow and Mr. Keller {{were on the}} landing outside, and those were the words {{exchanged}} between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you kindly, sir; please {{to let it}} be. I wake {{often in}} the night, and I {{like to see the}} heavens <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again I {{found myself}} lying upon {{a bed in}} a strange room. By my side was my father, leaning back in a low, easy chair.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I {{found myself}} {{on a bed}} in a darkened room. By my side was sitting a woman. I looked at her, and {{wondered}} who she was.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again. Strange, stiff {{garments}} were upon my body; garments that cracked and powdered {{away from me}} as I rose to a sitting posture.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} a {{clattering}} poker awakened me next morning and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> sleepy eyes and looked out a new world displayed itself before me.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> door, Mrs Bowater and Henry {{seemed to}} be {{awaiting}} me. Was it my fancy {{that both of them}} looked censorious? Absently she stood aside to let me pass to my room, then followed me in.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} it isn't always the man's fault," [...] said Dan darkly. [...] "When I get married I'll be good to my wife, but I mean to be boss. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> mouth my word will be law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jump! Didn't {{you make}} ME jump, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> a moment ago, and saw you sitting there, like {{the ghost of}} a girl miser, in the dead of the night.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} that I thought of, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> in the morning, {{was the fact that}} we would have to stay there all day, for we could not move on Sunday.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have lain insensible for many minutes, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and saw the surgeon and my second mate bending over me, it was still with the roar of cannon in my ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] she said; [...] "it is what I {{wanted to}} tell you to-day, when we were talking in your room. <b>My</b> only secret <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> heart to him at Limmeridge was a {{harmless}} secret, Marian--you said so yourself. The name was all I kept from him, and he has discovered it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{covered the}} rest of the fish in my basket with wet {{plantain}} leaves, and laid my trout king on this cool green bed. Then I hurried off to the old man, whom I saw coming out of the woods. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> basket and showed him what I had caught, Peter looked surprised, and, taking up the trout, examined it.|$|R
6000|$|I went to {{the head}} cashier the next morning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> little modicum of an account. He had {{received}} orders to pay my drafts without reference to my balance. My checks, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had overdrawn, were to be privately shown to Mr. Fauntleroy. Do many young men who start in business find their prosperous superiors ready to help them in that way? ...|$|R
60|$|When I awoke it was broad day once more. A gentleman sat on {{the edge}} of my bed. He had a queer, short face, ruddy as the harvest moon, and he smiled good-humouredly <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{six months}} I had brain-fever. During my illness ten grapeshot were {{extracted}} {{from my body}} which I had unconsciously received during the battle. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I met the sweet glance of a Sister of Charity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have seen}} some beastly {{creature}}s. Once in the Sudan I was dozing on the sand <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and there was a}} horrid creature like a big slug with horns, short and thick, about a foot long, moving away in front of me." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{one night}} <b>I</b> sleep, and, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> eyes, {{he is no}} longer near me. I run swiftly up the narrow stairs and along the silent corridor. The {{tapestry}} is drawn aside, and the hidden door stands open, and in the room beyond the friend that I loved is kneeling before an open chest, and the glint of the gold is in my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I try to {{struggle}} against it, but, coming after the strange complication of circumstances {{that has been}} closing round me for weeks past, {{there is something in}} this latest event of all that shakes my nerves. But one last chance of detection stood in <b>my</b> way <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> diary yesterday. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> it to-day, that chance is removed by Mr. Brock's death. It means something; I wish I knew what.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you make}} me--er--tired, don't you know," [...] gasped William Philander. [...] "It was a--er--a horrid trick. All the class were {{laughing}} at me. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> Greek book, out fell {{one of those}} horrid bills! And then I dropped another bill on the platform, and--oh, it was awful! I'll never forgive you, Tom Rover, never!" [...] And William Philander stalked away, still clutching the poster in his hand.|$|R
60|$|It {{was dark}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> aroused {{by the old}} negro's voice, so dark that I could not even {{distinguish}} the outlines of my comrade, and I understood that now was come {{the time for the}} venture of bringing Horry Sims to the cabin.|$|E
60|$|Of myself, I {{have only}} to say that I awoke {{on the morning of}} the twenty-sixth, {{perfectly}} ignorant of all that I had said and done under the influence of the opium--from the time when the drug first laid its hold on me, to the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> in Rachel's sitting-room.|$|E
60|$|The purblind day was feebly {{struggling}} with the fog <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon me. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown and cap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering {{as if he had}} cut them all.|$|E
6000|$|I was a {{long time}} in regaining entire self-command; but, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> sister's letter to Rupert, agreeably to her request, and perused it thrice without a pause, even to reflect. It was {{conceived}} in these words:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The woman,' said Nicholas, haughtily, 'the wife of {{the fellow}} from whom these charges come, dropped--as I suppose--a {{worthless}} ring among some clothes of mine, {{early in the morning}} on which I left the house. At least, I know that she was in the bedroom where they lay, struggling with an unhappy child, and that <b>I</b> found it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> bundle on the road. I returned it, at once, by coach, and they have it now.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Ah, but I haven’t {{introduced}} myself. Pleased to meet you, my name’s Linda. I’m thirty-one, {{five foot}} eight, 150 pounds and I wear the best clothes that {{money can buy}} (thanks to my husband’s limitless generosity). I arouse desire in men and envy in other women. And yet, every morning, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> eyes to this ideal world that everyone dreams of having but few achieve, I know the day will be a disaster." [...] - Excerpt from Adultery ...|$|R
60|$|Dawn, rosy red, confronted me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Breakfast was ready; Frank {{was packing}} Old Baldy; Jones {{talked to his}} horse as he saddled him; Wallace came stooping his giant figure under the pinyons; the dogs, eager and soft-eyed, sat around Jim and begged. The sun peeped over the Pink Cliffs; the desert still lay asleep, tranced in a purple and golden-streaked mist.|$|E
6000|$|... "I pulled back, made fast {{again to}} the jetty, {{and then went to}} sleep at last. I had faced the silence of the East. I had heard some of its languages. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again the silence was as {{complete}} as though it had never been broken. I was lying in a flood of light, and the sky had never looked so far, so high, before. I opened my eyes and lay without moving.|$|E
60|$|It {{could not}} have been more than a few seconds that I lay {{senseless}} there upon the northern ice, while all that was dearest to me drifted farther from my reach in the clutches of that black fiend, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> Thurid and Matai Shang yet battled at the ladder's top, and the flier drifted but a hundred yards farther to the south--but the end of the trailing rope was now a good thirty feet above the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg a {{thousand}} pardons, dear Sister: {{in these three}} long pages I talk to you of nothing but my troubles and affairs. A strange abuse it would be of any other person's friendship. But yours, my dear Sister, yours is known to me; and I am persuaded you are not impatient <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> heart to you:--a heart which is yours altogether; being filled with sentiments of the tenderest esteem, with which I am, my dearest Sister, your [in truth, affectionate Brother at all times] F."

60|$|As she had promised, it was Michelot who {{greeted me}} <b>when</b> next <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> eyes, on the {{following}} day. There were tears in his eyes--eyes that had looked grim and unmoved upon {{the horrors of the}} battlefield.|$|R
50|$|Maciej Zień {{has made}} a {{brilliant}} career—his clothes were worn by former First Lady of Poland Jolanta Kwaśniewska, soprano Ewa Małas-Godlewska, Polish pop singer Kayah and businesswoman Anna Starak. “Fashion has always been my great passion,” says Zień. “I decided what I wanted to do in life <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> atelier. It was created with single, expensive creations in mind, but it started to develop after a while.” Zień is also preparing a less expensive pret-a-porter collection and gradually creating a network of boutiques. Garments with a Mat Alex or Maciej Zień label can be bought in London and Geneva, and will soon appear in Monte Carlo.|$|R
