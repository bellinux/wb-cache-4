5|$|In winter, the {{resident}} bird population is increased by visitors from north-east Europe, {{in particular the}} widgeon and Greenland <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose.</b> Riverside mammals are seen frequently and otters, mink and fox are common. Trout and salmon are less common in the Shannon than they once were, however pike is still plentiful and attracts many anglers.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} ducks, geese and swans is {{greatest}} in winter, with large flocks of greater white-fronted geese, sometimes {{with a rare}} lesser <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> amongst them. Bewick's swans are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern Russia to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. Birds of prey such as peregrine and merlin also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, {{and it is a}} good place to see the elusive water rail.|$|E

Other rare {{riverine}} birds include kingfishers (Blyth's kingfisher), herons (white-bellied heron), pelicans (Dalmatian pelican, spot-billed pelican), shanks (spotted greenshank) and terns (black-bellied tern). Rare migratory storks and cranes are also seen wintering {{in the park}} (lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, Asian openbill).|$|E
25|$|Northern Ponds is {{a series}} of naturalistic ponds home to a variety of {{waterfowl}} and other aquatic birds both wild and captive. Captive residents include black-necked crane, red-breasted goose, lesser <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> American ruddy duck, barnacle goose, and trumpeter swan. A wide variety of wild bird species can also be found in the ponds, including several native ducks such as mallards and mergansers, as well as other birds such as black-capped night-herons.|$|E

Lithographically printed on unwatermarked paper by a number of different printers, the stamps were designed by Killian Mullarney.

50|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{are a key}} factor in the annual breeding success of <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese.</b> In the Arctic, the window of opportunity for nesting, incubating eggs, and raising a brood to flight state is open briefly, for about three months. Arriving in late May or early June, <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> begin departing for fall staging areas in early September. This means that a delayed snowmelt or late spring storm can significantly reduce the birds' reproductive success.|$|R
2500|$|The Park {{boasts a}} wealth of bird life, and is of ornithological {{importance}} because it supports a diverse range of birds. 141 bird species have been recorded in the park, including upland, woodland and wintering waterfowl species. Several species which are otherwise rare in Ireland are present, notably the woodland species redstart (1–2 pairs), wood warbler (1–2 pairs), and garden warbler (possibly up to 10 pairs). The red grouse and ring ouzel are on the IUCN Red List of species of high conservation concern (1–2 pairs each). The Greenland <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> merlin, and peregrine are listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. Other noteworthy species found in the park are the chough, nightjar, and osprey. The osprey sometimes passes through the park as it migrates between northern Africa and Scandinavia. Historical accounts and place names suggest that the osprey bred {{in the area in}} the past. Golden eagles once nested in the park, but were extirpated around 1900 as a result of disturbance, nest robbing, and persecution.|$|E

60|$|This bird deserves some notice, as {{hardly any}} other anciently domesticated bird or quadruped has varied so little. That geese were anciently domesticated {{we know from}} certain verses in Homer; and from these birds having been kept (388 B.C.) in the Capitol at Rome as sacred to Juno, which sacredness implies great antiquity. (8/20. 'Ceylon' by Sir J.E. Tennent 1859 volume 1 page 485; also J. Crawfurd on the 'Relation of Domest. Animals to Civilisation' read before Brit. Assoc. 1860. See also 'Ornamental Poultry' by Rev. E.S. Dixon 1848 page 132. The goose figured on the Egyptian monuments {{seems to have been}} the Red goose of Egypt.) That the goose has varied in some degree, we may infer from naturalists not being {{unanimous}} with respect to its wild parent-form; though the difficulty is chiefly due to the existence of three or four closely allied wild European species. (8/21. Macgillivray's 'British Birds' volume 4 page 593.) A large majority of capable judges are convinced that our geese are descended from the wild Grey-leg goose (Anser ferus); the young of which can easily be tamed. (8/22. Mr. A. Strickland, 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 3rd series volume 3 1859 page 122, reared some young wild geese, and found them in habits and in all characters identical with the domestic goose.) This species, when crossed with the domestic goose, produced in the Zoological Gardens, as I was assured in 1849, perfectly fertile offspring. (8/23. See also Hunter 'Essays' edited by Owen volume 2 page 322.) Yarrell (8/24. Yarrell's 'British Birds' volume 3 page 142.) has observed that {{the lower part of the}} trachea of the domestic goose is sometimes flattened, and that a ring of white feathers sometimes surrounds the base of the beak. These characters seem at first sight good indications of a cross at some former period with the <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (A. albifrons); but the white ring is variable in this latter species, and we must not overlook the law of analogous variation; that is, of one species assuming some of the characters of allied species.|$|E

50|$|Midcontinental <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> in North America {{have many}} {{breeding}} areas and each group in each breeding area differs in its migration time and wintering location. There are six breeding areas, including interior Alaska, the North Slope of Alaska, western Northwest Territories, western Nunavut, central Nunavut, and eastern Nunavut. These spatial differences lead to different departure times for <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> leaving their breeding areas.

40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry have raised {{interest in the}} interplay between avian influenza (AI) viruses and their wild hosts. Studies linking virus ecology to host ecology are still scarce, particularly for non-duck species. Here, we link capture-resighting data of greater <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> Anser albifrons albifrons with the AI virus infection data collected during capture in The Netherlands in four consecutive winters. We ask what factors are related to AI virus prevalence and whether there are ecological consequences associated with AI virus infection in staging <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese.</b> Mean seasonal (low pathogenic) AI virus prevalence ranged between 2. 5 and 10. 7 per cent, among the highest reported values for non-duck species, and occurred in distinct peaks with near-zero prevalence before and after. Throat samples had a 2. 4 times higher detection frequency than cloacal samples. AI virus infection {{was significantly related to}} age and body mass in some but not other winters. AI virus infection was not related to resighting probability, nor to maximum distance travelled, which was at least 191 km during the short infectious lifespan of an AI virus. Our results suggest that transmission via the respiratory route could be an important transmission route of AI virus in this species. Nearzero prevalence upon arrival on their wintering grounds, in combination with the epidemic nature of AI virus infections in <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese,</b> suggests that <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> are not likely to disperse Asian AI viruses from their Siberian breeding grounds to their European wintering areas...|$|R
