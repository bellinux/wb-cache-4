2500|$|From {{the formal}} {{characteristics}} of this inference alone (All As are Bs; c {{is not a}} B; Therefore, c is not an A), formal logic would judge {{this to be a}} valid inference. Schiller, however, refused to evaluate the validity of this inference merely on its formal characteristics. Schiller argued that unless <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the contextual fact regarding what specific problem first prompted this inference to actually occur, we can not determine whether the inference was successful (i.e. pragmatically successful). In the case of this inference, since [...] "Cerebos is 'salt' for culinary, but not for chemical purposes", without knowing whether the purpose for this piece of reasoning was culinary or chemical we cannot determine whether this is valid or not. In another example, Schiller discusses the truth of formal mathematics [...] "1+1=2" [...] and points out that this equation does not hold if one is discussing drops of water. Schiller's attack on formal logic and formal mathematics never gained much attention from philosophers, however it does share some weak similarities to the contextualist view in contemporary epistemology as well as the views of ordinary language philosophers. (The [...] "All salt is soluble in water," [...] argument is valid according to both Aristotelian and Boolean forms of logic as Mood A-O-O, figure 2. [...] The issue regarding testing for validity and/or soundness is whether or not Cerebos is water soluble, alone, no matter the use of the salt. [...] One would not want to use insoluble salt in cooking, but such an issue does not effect whether or not such salt is water soluble).|$|E
