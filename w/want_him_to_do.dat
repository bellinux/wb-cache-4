25|$|Twain {{moved his}} family to Hartford, Connecticut, where he {{arranged}} {{the building of a}} home starting in 1873. In the 1870s and 1880s, the family summered at Quarry Farm in Elmira, the home of Olivia's sister, Susan Crane. In 1874, Susan had a study built apart from the main house so that Twain would have a quiet place in which to write. Also, he smoked cigars constantly, and Susan did not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in her house.|$|E

[...] "What he does is get {{underneath}} your skin, whoever he's negotiating with, because he figures out what your objectives are, your angles. He understands the market; he understands the players. He's a brash, arrogant, egotistical, aggressive negotiator, which is good, because when you have someone represent you, you <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. Marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one {{who came up with}} the concept of 'Air Jordan.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The pilot director, David Nutter, {{was looking}} through {{pictures}} of actors and stumbled on Tom Welling's image. When {{he asked about}} Welling, the casting director said Welling's manager did not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the role because it could hurt his feature film career. After a conversation with Welling's manager, Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot, which convinced him to do the part. Welling's initial fears were quelled after reading the script, {{when he realized that}} the show was not about Clark [...] "... being a super hero ...," [...] but more about the character attempting to live a normal life as a teenager.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The one thing I do not <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why {{are you trying to}} be mean?" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Australia's {{ruthless}} on-field {{dominance and}} {{a succession of}} one-sided victories, the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest. Bradman's dominant cricketing stature was {{a key factor in}} his team's popularity with the public, especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign. A leading cricket writer of the time, R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, said [...] "we <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well. We feel we have a share in him. He is more than Australian. He is a world batsman." [...] The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that [...] "cities, towns and hotels are beflagged, carpets set down, and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome. He is the Prince of Cricketers." [...] Writing later, Haigh opined that [...] "perhaps no touring cricketer... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer". Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day, and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live, causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin. Of Bradman's retirement, Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "...a miracle has been removed from among us... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal." ...|$|E

500|$|Bradman's {{dominant}} cricketing stature {{was also}} a key platform of his team's popularity with the public. The leading English writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said [...] "we <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well. We feel we have a share in him. He is more than Australian. He is a world batsman." [...] Haigh opined that [...] "perhaps no touring cricketer... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer". The Australians were invariably greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country. The attendance at the Fourth Test remains a record for a Test on English soil. The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that [...] "cities, towns and hotels are beflagged, carpets set down, and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome. He is the Prince of Cricketers." [...] Haigh said that [...] "cricket approached the 50s {{at the peak of}} its popularity, albeit, after Bradman's final Test... without the player chiefly responsible for it". Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day, and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live, causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin. Of Bradman's retirement, Robertson-Glasgow said [...] "...a miracle has been removed from among us... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing [...] "The Sleeper" [...] {{sees the}} {{characters}} in a different light. Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats, the episode sees the MI5 team going {{to great lengths to}} get the sleeper agent, Fred Roberts, to do what they <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character, as well as despise the main characters on some level for their methods. There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case, including Adam's interrogation methods, brinking on torture, in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". [...] "Love and Death" [...] sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination. Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly, as he wanted somebody like Danny going through [...] "something dreadful." [...] He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in [...] "Looking After Our Own", but [...] "Love and Death" [...] did this in {{the point of view of}} the killer, not the victim. [...] "Celebrity" [...] introduces a new plot style, which does not involve terror threats. Brenton wrote it as a more light-hearted episode that saw the characters emmeshed in a world they cannot handle. Despite this, Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than fighting terrorism, though they would not gain as much media attention. Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country, as if a national icon is under threat, the country's morale could drop. [...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] and [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] were considered for the second series, but because there was not room for them, the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series.|$|E

50|$|Following the release, Esquivel {{once again}} quit the band, {{claiming}} he only intended to record some material with Defiance {{because that was}} what Doug Harrington had <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before he died.

He said that saving three Jews does not wash the blood off someone who has {{probably}} killed hundreds.|$|R
6000|$|There {{is nothing}} I wouldn't suffer {{if it would}} do him any [...] good. I never thought any one could feel so.

60|$|It {{was like}} tearing {{through a maze}} of diamond-glittering spiders' webs to say good-bye and escape, for at each {{movement}} Mrs. Hilbery remembered something further about the villainies of picture-framers or the delights of poetry, and at one time it seemed to the young man that he would be hypnotized into doing what she pretended to <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> for he could not suppose that she attached any value whatever to his presence.
