500|$|The way {{the bridge}} flows in a {{continuum}} of unexpected directions is a break from Gehry's other work and other more traditional urban and architectural forms nearby. [...] Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Kamin gave the bridge four stars (out of a possible four) in his review and admires [...] how [...] "computers have given Gehry unparalleled formal freedom" [...] to design [...] "the complexity of its geometry" [...] and multidimensional curvatures. The bridge provides views of both the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Lake Michigan {{in a way that}} Kamin says makes it a belvedere. Kamin also recommends anyone having a bad day to stroll across the bridge, adding, [...] "You won't get where you're going quickly, but you'll feel a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> once you're done." ...|$|E
500|$|The iOS version's {{improvements}} {{over the}} original PSP version were positively received. The website Famitsu App {{noted that the}} iOS version has shorter loading times and greater display resolution compared to the PSP version. Gay wrote that the iPhone 4's Retina Display made the game look [...] "a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> than it did on the PSP or Vita", while Kumada said he was stunned to see the iPhone 5's more vibrant colors and lack of interlacing, despite its smaller screen compared to the PSP. At the same time, reviewers had mixed opinions regarding the iOS' version's control scheme. Ryūichi Matsumoto of 4Gamer.net appreciated the iOS version's use of touch screen input, feeling that it simplified the controls and Gay felt the touch controls felt natural. In contrast, Famitsu App's writer {{felt that it was}} easier to hold down notes with the PSP's buttons, and Chuang said that playing on an iPad Mini felt less precise than on the PSP, but noted that the player can theoretically [...] "hit the notes even faster" [...] with a touch screen. Chuang also noted he occasionally opened the iOS version's pause menu by accident due to the touch controls, and Matsumoto complained that the use of touch screen input meant that his fingers would be blocking his view.|$|E
500|$|Wishology {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Eileen Cruz of Toon Zone mainly praised it. Specifically, {{she observes}} that it [...] "manages to remain largely fresh {{the entire time}} for an animated comedy episode over two hours long". Aaron Bynum of The Animation Insider, however, gave a more negative review. He suggested it was only [...] "moderately entertaining", saying it is [...] "just another over-exerted animated epic of an over-extended property." [...] Cruz commented positively on the show's usage of a mix of standard and computer animation; however, she noted the blend between special 3D objects and their surroundings was [...] "not perfect", though [...] "not distracting either". Bynum stated the animated trilogy's usage of computer animation was [...] "rather needless", and its cultural parodies were [...] "tired and forgettable". While he finds [...] "The Final Ending" [...] interesting {{enough to keep the}} viewer engaged, he also criticized the series as a whole. He said, [...] "it would appear that the cartoon is no longer an exclusive journey into one child's ever-changing imagination; now, it's just a fanciful what-if". Cruz praised the role of the band Kiss. She cannot think of too many other bands that [...] "could exist in such a universe with such an exaggerated reality". However, she criticized the voice portrayal of Turbo Thunder, finding it to be [...] "entirely unattractive" [...] and [...] "off-putting," [...] and thus [...] "it simply didn't work for me." [...] Bynum, however, had a more positive reaction to the character. He noted Turbo Thunder was [...] "hilariously pretentious and self-serving", and he [...] "ultimately makes the second chapter [...] a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> by acting as a frenemy with similar goals." ...|$|E

There, while the car was being got ready, he stood in the window, very sore; {{thinking}} of what he had meant to do; thinking of his good intentions; thinking of what was coming to the country, when a man could not even get his laborers to come and hear what he had to say. And a sense of injustice, of anger, of bewilderment, harrowed his very soul.|$|R

Our energy on the bench was great and when we lost we supported each other and came back each day and gave our best. Every game counts so that was key. My team as a <b>whole</b> worked a <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> together this year.” He added, “For me this is a massive opportunity {{to be in the same}} team with Stan - Grand Slam Champion, Marcelo - number one doubles player in the world, Carlos - one of the greatest players to have ever played. For me sitting on the bench its massive watching them and seeing how they train. The relationships I now have. Thats priceless!” ...|$|R
5000|$|Although Bosley Crowther panned {{the film}} in the New York Times of August 2, 1956, (calling it a [...] "dismal tale") Lawrence Quirk in Motion Picture Herald and William Zinsser in the New York Herald Tribune commented favorably upon the film. [...] Autumn Leaves was a modest box-office success, chiefly among Crawford's female fans. The actress thought highly of the film, deeming it the [...] "best older woman/younger man movie ever made," [...] and added, [...] "Everything clicked on Autumn Leaves. The cast was perfect, the script was good, and I think Bob Aldrich handled {{everything}} well. I really think Cliff did a stupendous job; another actor might have been spitting out his lines and chewing the scenery, but he avoided that trap. I think the movie on a <b>whole</b> was a <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> {{than some of the}} romantic movies I did in the past...but somehow it just never became better known. It was eclipsed by the picture I did with Bette Davis." ...|$|R
500|$|Amiga Format {{stated that}} this [...] "fine {{adventure}} game well worth investigating" [...] could compete with Sierra and LucasFilm games; [...] "in any event, Temptress surpasses almost anything Sierra have offered, by being larger, funnier, and a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> drawn ... an innovative system knocks spots of the Sierra-standards and shows LucasFilm {{a thing or}} two" [...] and also praised its humour, saying that there's [...] "a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humour and fairy-tale nonsense." [...] The One praised the game's controls, saying that [...] "the game's impressive user-friendliness is undoubtably one of its strong points," [...] adding that [...] "Lure of the Temptress {{is every bit as}} professional and polished as anything the Americans and French have been able to offer us recently" [...] but [...] "Lure is, if anything, a little too serious and sombre" [...] and that [...] "LucasFilm's games boast the more interesting characters and interaction sequences." [...] Amiga Power praised its graphics, saying they are [...] "very pretty drawn, with the dark, moody look you'd expect from a town being oppressed by an evil Temptress," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best graphic adventures ever" [...] that's [...] "up there with Monkey Island 1 and Beneath a Steel Sky," [...] and adding that the [...] "only drawback is that it's shorter than your average adventure." [...] Mega Zone praised the game, stating that it is a [...] "Sierra/Lucasfilmish with really, really good playability. We're talking 32 colours graphics which look really nice, with playability which is really smooth, and simply pure gaming enjoyment here," [...] adding that [...] "the manual is very well written, the sound the graphics are all there, disc access is very good, and looking at the way the whole game is put together right down to the intro it's one of the most amazing Amiga Adventures every written! An Adventure Zone classic!" [...] Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power opined that Core Design's rival 1992 fantasy adeventure game Curse of Enchantia (also published by Virgin) was [...] "a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot." ...|$|E

Now, suppose I buy in all the street railways of Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, San Leandro, and the rest,--bring them under one head with a competent management? Suppose I cut the time to San Francisco one-half by building a big pier out there almost to Goat Island and establishing a ferry system with modern up-to-date boats? Why, folks will want to live over on this side. Very good. They'll need land on which to build. So, first I buy up the land. But the land's cheap now. Why? Because it's in the country, no electric roads, no quick communication, nobody guessing that the electric roads are coming. I'll build the roads. That will make the land jump up. Then I'll sell the land as fast as the folks will want to buy because of the improved ferry system and transportation facilities.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are times}} when I think it wasn’t stupidity. Maybe, like some men I know, he was too wise to work. I shouldn’t wonder if he put it all over us with that {{intelligence}} of his. Maybe he figured it all out and decided that a licking now and again and no work was a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> than work {{all the time and}} no licking. He was intelligent enough for such a computation. I tell you, I’ve sat and looked into that dog’s eyes till the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like yeast, what of the intelligence I saw shining out. I can’t express myself about that intelligence. It is beyond mere words. I saw it, that’s all. At times it was like gazing into a human soul, to look into his eyes; and what I saw there frightened me and started all sorts of ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest. I tell you I sensed something big in that brute’s eyes; there was a message there, but I wasn’t big enough myself to catch it. Whatever it was (I know I’m making a fool of myself)—whatever it was, it baffled me. I can’t give an inkling of what I saw in that brute’s eyes; it wasn’t light, it wasn’t colour; it was something that moved, away back, when the eyes themselves weren’t moving. And I guess I didn’t see it move either; I only sensed that it moved. It was an expression—that’s what it was—and I got an impression of it. No; it was different from a mere expression; it was more than that. I don’t know what it was, but it gave me a feeling of kinship just the same. Oh, no, not sentimental kinship. It was, rather, a kinship of equality. Those eyes never pleaded like a deer’s eyes. They challenged. No, it wasn’t defiance. It was just a calm assumption of equality. And I don’t think it was deliberate. My belief is that it was unconscious on his part. It was there because it was there, and it couldn’t help shining out. No, I don’t mean shine. It didn’t shine; it moved. I know I’m talking rot, but if you’d looked into that animal’s eyes the way I have, you’d understand. Steve was affected the same way I was. Why, I tried to kill that Spot once—he was no good for anything; and I fell down on it. I led him out into the brush, and he came along slow and unwilling. He knew what was going on. I stopped in a likely place, put my foot on the rope, and pulled my big Colt’s. And that dog sat down and looked at me. I tell you he didn’t plead. He just looked. And I saw all kinds of incomprehensible things moving, yes, moving, in those eyes of his. I didn’t really see them move; I thought I saw them, for, as I said before, I guess I only sensed them. And I want to tell you right now that it got beyond me. It was like killing a man, a conscious, brave man, who looked calmly into your gun as much as to say, “Who’s afraid?” ...|$|E

There it was, right before me, glimmering all around in those eyes of his. And then it was too late. I got scared. I was trembly all over, and my stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me seasick. I just sat down and looked at that dog, and he looked at me, till I thought I was going crazy. Do {{you want to know what}} I did? I threw down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of God in my heart. Steve laughed at me.
