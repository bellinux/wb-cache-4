50|$|Carex aquatilis is {{a species}} of sedge known by the common names <b>water</b> <b>sedge</b> and leafy tussock sedge. It has a circumboreal distribution, {{occurring}} throughout the northern reaches of the Northern Hemisphere. It grows in many types of mountainous and Arctic habitat, including temperate coniferous forest, alpine meadows, tundra, and wetlands. There are several varieties of this species, and it is somewhat variable in appearance. It produces triangular stems reaching heights between 20 centimeters and 1.5 meters, and generally does not form clumps as some other sedges do. It grows from a dense rhizome network which produces a mat of fine roots thick enough to form sod, and includes aerenchyma to allow the plant to survive in low-oxygen substrates like heavy mud. The inflorescence bears a number of spikes with one leaflike bract at the base which is longer than the inflorescence itself. The fruits are glossy achenes, and although the plant occasionally reproduces by seed, {{most of the time}} it reproduces vegetatively, spreading via its rhizome. In fact, in any given year, most shoots produce no flowers. This perennial plant lives up to 10 years or more, can form peat as its rhizome system decomposes, and is sometimes used to revegetate areas where peat has been harvested.|$|E

40|$|Herbivores ingesting {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) contaminated plants may be chronically exposed to PAHs through their diet. This PAH exposure, can result in toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic effects. However, {{little is known about}} how differences in morphology and physiology between plant species alters PAH environmental accumulation and release in the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion. Bioaccessibility of PAHs was examined in six different sub-arctic plant species [black spruce (Picea mariana); labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum); bog birch (Betula glandulosa); green alder (Alnus crispa); <b>water</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex aquatilis); and little-tree willow (Salix arbusculoides) ] from a reference and PAH impacted site near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada. Plants were digested using a simulator of the human upper digestive track and toxicity tested using the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Assay (Ah assay). Results show that there is a significant difference in bioaccessible PAH concentration between the plant species tested (p < 0. 05) in new growth. New growth of green alder contained the highest, with 0. 425 mg (SE = 0. 1) benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) equivalent per gram of wet weight plant tissue, and black spruce contained the lowest BaP equivalent concentration of 0 mg BaP per gram of plant tissue. Of the plants species that exhibited bioaccessible PAH concentrations, those that were growing on the PAH contaminated site had accumulated up to 1. 24 x higher PAH concentrations. New growth plant tissue had on average a 69 % and 38 % greater bioaccessible PAH concentration than old growth for the reference and impacted site respectively. Nominal additions of BaP with digested plant extracts revealed that black spruce, labrador tea, <b>water</b> <b>sedge,</b> and willow all contained endogenous Ah antagonists (p < 0. 05). No correlation was elucidated between chemical and physical plant parameters such as % lipid content, cuticle thickness, and leaf surface area (p < 0. 05). The lack of a correlation between the plant physical properties and BaP equivalent concentration may be a result of the antagonist effect some of the digested plant extracts had on the Ah assay. Understanding plant uptake and bioaccessibility of PAHs in ingested plant matrices will aid in determining toxicological risk to herbivores inhabiting PAH contaminated sites...|$|E

The purpose of our research was to determine if soil properties and water quality could help to explain why the area of sedge is expanding. We conducted an observational study, using geophysical methods and standard sampling techniques to determine the relationship between grass and sedge zonation and soil properties and water quality. Our findings showed that both the electrical conductivity of the soil solution at saturation (ECe) and surface water electrical conductivity (ECw) were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in sedge communities than in grass communities (mean ECe of sedge = 4. 4 dS/m; mean ECe grass = 3. 7 dS/m; mean ECw of sedge = 0. 5 dS/m; mean ECw of grass = 0. 2 dS/m).

However, little is known about how differences in morphology and physiology among plant species alter the environmental accumulation of aryl hydrocarbons or their release and subsequent activity in the gastrointestinal tract of herbivores after ingestion. In the present study, the activity of aryl hydrocarbons during digestion was examined using six Arctic plant species growing in impacted and reference sites near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada.

Bioaccessible aryl hydrocarbon activity varied among the plant species tested. The species with the greatest activity was green alder, and the species with the least activity was black spruce. Further investigation revealed that digested plant extracts may antagonize the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and prevent bioactivation of the aryl compound benzo[a]pyrene. Thus, PAH risk from the ingestion of vegetation varies among plant species and may depend on antagonists present in the vegetation...|$|E

Not all riparian community types in this portion of the Blue Mountains were sampled due to time limitations. Some of the major community types sampled included: Baltic rush (Juncus balticus) communities; Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) communities; beaked sedge (Carex rostrata) communities; <b>water</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex aquatilis) communities; mountain alder (Alnus incana) communities; and various willow communities (Salix geyeriana, Salix exigua ssp. exigua, Salix rigida var. mackenziana, and Salix lemmonii). Sites were selected to maximize geographic variation. Piezometers were placed at each site to determine depth to water table. Soil temperature at depths of 15 cm and 50 cm and water table depth were measured semi-weekly. Plant frequency and understory cover by species were determined using 25 cm square plot frames along three 10 m transects in each community sampled. Belt transects were run to determine tree and shrub densities. Tree cover was determined using a hand-held densiometer and the line-intercept method was used for shrub cover. Soils were described and samples were collected from each horizon for laboratory determination of percent organic carbon, soil texture, and reaction (pH). Ordinations of plant communities and plant species were calculated using the DECORANA program for detrended correspondence analysis. The first axis of ordination arranged both species and communities along a moisture gradient. This was verified by correlation analysis as well as through canonical correlation of a species matrix and an environmental matrix.

Aquatic plants completely submerged in the lake waters showed different 14 C activity depending on the sampling location and their a 14 C correlated with the a 14 C of DIC. Steady increase of a 14 C of DIC in downstream direction was also reflected in the increase of a 14 C of the aquatic plants but the values were about 10 pMC higher than those of DIC. Top 20 cm of surface soil represented the average of organic material (humus) deposited in several years and a 14 C was slightly higher than that of atmospheric CO 2 in the last year. d 13 C values of measured samples correlated with the origin of carbon in different materials. For the plants which used atmospheric CO 2 for photosyntesis, terrestrial plants and sedge, d 13 C values ranged from - 31 %o to - 27 ‰. For aquatic plants d 13 C values varied in wide range from - 48 ‰ to - 30 ‰, showing that the source of carbon was mainly DIC in water but also carbon of organic decomposition.

6000|$|Ascending very steeply {{for several}} {{thousand}} feet, we reached a hollow on the Catsuperri spur, beyond which the lake lies {{buried in a}} deep forest. A Lama from the adjacent temple accompanied us, and I found my people affecting great solemnity as they approached its sacred bounds; they incessantly muttered [...] "Om mani," [...] etc., kotowed to trees and stones, and hung bits of rag on the bushes. A pretence of opposing our progress {{was made by the}} priest, who of course wanted money; this I did not appear to notice, and after a steep descent, we were soon on the shores of what is, for Sikkim, a grand sheet of water, (6,040 feet above the sea), without any apparent outlet: it may be from three to five hundred yards across in the rains, but was much less now, and was bordered by a broad marsh of bog moss (Sphagnum), in which were abundance of Azolla, colouring the <b>waters</b> red, and <b>sedges.</b> Along the banks were bushes of Rhododendron barbatum and Berberis insignis,* [This magnificent new species has not been introduced into England; it forms a large bush, with deep-green leaves seven inches long, and bunches of yellow flowers.] but the mass of the vegetation was similar to that of Dorjiling.|$|R
40|$|Yellowstone Lake {{occupies}} {{a large portion}} of Yellowstone National Park, WY and conceals within its depths many geothermal features. Though somewhat less spectacular and much less accessible, these sublacustrine hot springs, geysers, and fumaroles, like their famous terrestrial counterparts, emit fluids and gasses enriched with many chemical and mineral nutrients. Many chemical constituents of these hydrothermal inputs are biologically relevant to microbial life in Yellowstone Lake. Hydrogen sulfide, sulfate, ammonium, and many other compounds are common constituents of hydrothermal fluids and are found at varying concentrations throughout the lake These chemicals have significant effects on the chemistry, microbial ecology, nutrient cycles (e g., sulfur and nitrogen), and ecosystem function of Yellowstone Lake, and support a wide variety of microbiological habitats in which Bacteria with potentially unique niche characteristics could exploit. In order to understand these effects, the diversity of three specific Bacterial communities associated with hydrothermal emanations were examined. The first community sampled included white, film-like Bacteria observed on the surfaces of aquatic macrophytes that were directly exposed to flowing hydrothermal <b>waters</b> in <b>Sedge</b> Bay. It was hypothesized that the Bacterial community associated with the white film material differed from that of a more typical green macrophyte. Furthermore, analysis of the bacterial diversity of these white films tested the hypothesis that Thiothrix species were an important component of these communities. The second Bacterial community was observed on artificial substrata that had been submerged in the hydrothermal waters near Pelican Roost. The physical-chemical properties of substrata influence biological adhesion. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the composition of the Bacterial communities present on two different substrata (glass and polycarbonate), exposed to hydrothermal waters would differ. The gross visual similarity between the white films studied in Sedge Bay and those found on the artificial substrata in Pelican Roost led to the hypothesis that Thiothrix would be a major constituent of these Bacterial communities as well. The third community consisted of nitrogen-fixing Bacteria collected from various locations throughout Yellowstone Lake. Nitrogen limitation in Yellowstone Lake and the discovery of nitrogen-fixing Bacteria within the streams and terrestrial geothermal features of Yellowstone National Park led to the hypothesis that the hydrothermal features within Yellowstone Lake could support thermophilic, diazotrophic Bacteria. As the emanations from hydrothermal vents vary in both temperature and chemical composition, it was further hypothesized that the structure and nitrogen-fixing activity of diazotrophic communities associated with hydrothermal fluids would also vary. By employing a variety of microscopic analyses, non-culture molecular techniques, including 16 S rDNA or nifH DNA and RNA amplification, sequence analysis, and culture-based physiological analyses it was demonstrated that: (1) The Bacteria coating plants in Sedge Bay were indeed composed primarily of members of the genus Thiothrix, (2) Bacteria coating artificial substrata were composed primarily of the genera Sulfurimonas and Sulfuricurvum, and some differences were observed between the Bacterial found on glass and polycarbonate substrata, and (3) Bacteria with nifH sequences related to the genera Methylocistis and Methylomonas appear to be actively participating in nitrogen-fixation within the hydrothermal vents of Yellowstone Lake. This census of the ecological distribution of microorganisms around the chemically rich hydrothermal emanations of Yellowstone Lake will promote understanding of how these bacteria interact with their environment and the role of biodiversity in this environment. With an understanding of this ecological distribution {{it will be possible to}} discern the relationship between microbial species diversity and the function of these Bacterial ecosystems in Yellowstone Lake...|$|R
40|$|Final {{report to}} BP. The Prudhoe Bay oil fields, Alaska were {{discovered}} in 1968, [...] and commercial production commenced in 1977 with the [...] completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Oil production has [...] been declining since 1989, although additional exploratory [...] drilling continues. Support facilities for oil production are [...] built on permafrost soils that surface-thaw in summer to form [...] extensive wetlands composed of moist meadows, sedge marshes, [...] moist sedge-dwarf shrub tundra, grass marshes, small ponds [...] and lakes (Walker and Acevedo 1987). To prevent thawing and [...] subsidence of subsurface, ice-rich soils, gravel pads, 2 m (6 ft) or [...] more thickness have been built to support drilling sites as well as [...] roads, airstrips and building pads (Kidd et al. 2006). As well sites [...] are decommissioned, the gravel is wholly or partially removed [...] resulting in the need for site rehabilitation and/or restoration to [...] support wetland plants and, in some instances, enhance wildlife [...] habitat (McKendrick 1991, Jorgenson and Joyce 1994, Kidd et [...] al. 2004, 2006). Since the 1970 s, methods to revegetate arctic wetlands have [...] included a variety of planting techniques, seed treatments, [...] seeding with native and non-native species (mostly grasses), [...] and fertilizer applications (Chapin and Chapin 1980; Bishop [...] and Chapin 1989, Jorgenson 1988, Kidd and Rossow 1998, [...] Kidd et al. 2004, 2006, Maslen and Kershaw 1989, McKendrick [...] 1987, 1991, 2000, McKendrick et al. 1980, McKendrick and [...] Mitchell 1978, Mitchell et al. 1974). Treatments also have [...] included sprigging and plug transplantation (Kidd et al. 2004, [...] 2006), surface manipulation (Streever et al. 2003), as well as [...] natural re-colonization (Ebersole 1987, Schwarzenbach 1996). [...] These methods have been partially successful. The gravelly soils [...] often are dry, nutrient-poor, and have a higher pH and lower [...] organic matter content than surrounding soils, so natural recolonization [...] does not occur readily (Bishop and Chapin 1989, [...] Jorgenson and Joyce 1994). Methods such as sprigging and plug [...] transplanting are slow, labor intensive and expensive compared [...] to direct seeding. Fertilization, especially with phosphorus, is [...] recommended for long-term survival of plants grown on gravelly [...] sandy soils (BP Exploration and McKendrick 2004). [...] Two common species in the arctic coastal wetlands are <b>water</b> [...] <b>sedge,</b> Carex aquatilis Wahlenb. and cotton sedge, Eriophorum [...] angustifolium Honck. Carex aquatilis in particular forms large [...] populations that spread vegetatively by rhizomes and often [...] dominate these wetland environments (Shaver and Billings [...] 1975). Despite their abundance, these species have not been [...] considered for revegetation because of poor seed germination [...] and inadequate information on seed development and viability [...] (Dr. William Streever, BP Alaska, pers. comm.). Both Carex and [...] Eriophorum in arctic environments produce abundant seeds, but [...] seed viability and germination often is low and highly variable [...] among years and locations (Archibold 1984, Billings and [...] Mooney 1968, Ebersole 1989, Gartner et al. 1983). [...] Germination recommendations for both species vary by [...] location and have included an array of pretreatments such as light, alternating temperatures, cold stratification, scarification, [...] and high and low temperature dry storage (Amen 1966, Billings [...] and Mooney 1960, Bliss 1958, Hunt and Moore 2003, Johnson [...] et al. 1965, Phillips 1954 and Steinfeld 2001). The purpose [...] of this project was to explore methods of seed germination of [...] Carex aquatilis and Eriophorum angustifolium, to learn the [...] conditions for germination and dormancy control mechanisms, [...] and identify seed treatments that might enhance germination [...] for eventual use in direct-seeding or plug production for arctic [...] wetland revegetation...|$|R
