40|$|To date, few {{researchers}} have solved three-dimensional free-surface problems with dynamic <b>wetting</b> <b>lines.</b> This paper extends the free-surface {{finite element method}} described in a companion paper [Cairncross, R.

", to be published (1998) ] to handle dynamic wetting. A generalization of the technique used in two dimensional modeling to circumvent double-valued velocities at the <b>wetting</b> <b>line,</b> the so-called kinematic paradox, is presented for a <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> in three dimensions. This approach requires the fluid velocity normal to the contact line to be zero, the fluid velocity tangent to the contact line to be equal to the tangential component of web velocity, and the fluid velocity into the web to be zero. In addition, slip is allowed in a narrow strip along the substrate surface near the dynamic contact line. For realistic wetting-line motion, a contact angle which varies with wetting speed is required because contact lines in three dimensions typically advance or recede a different rates depending upon location and/or have both advancing and receding portions. The theory is applied to capillary rise of static fluid in a corner, the initial motion of a Newtonian droplet down an inclined plane, and extrusion of a Newtonian fluid from a nozzle onto a moving substrate. The extrusion results are compared to experimental visualization. Subject Categorie...|$|R
40|$|YesThe coating flow {{examined}} here, labelled angled dip coating, is {{that where}} a substrate enters a pool of liquid forming an angle ß with the vertical so that it intersects the liquid along a <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> which is not perpendicular to the direction of its motion. This flow situation is distinctly different from that where the substrate, inclined in the other dimension by the so-called angle of entry ¿, intersects the liquid surface perpendicularly to its motion. Experiments were carried out with various liquids {{to determine the effect}} of ß on the substrate velocity at which air is entrained into the liquid. It was observed that as this angle departs from zero, air entrainment is delayed to higher speeds. The data show that the speed which is relevant to air entrainment is not the velocity of the substrate itself but its component normal to the <b>wetting</b> <b>line.</b> This result has important practical implications and suggests that this fundamental principle is also applicable to other coating flows...|$|R
40|$|All {{available}} dynamic {{contact angle}} theories [1] {{suggest that the}} dynamic contact angle will not be much (or even at all) affected by the viscosity of the air. In other words, the viscosity of the air plays no role its entrainment when the <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> breaks. Dynamic <b>wetting</b> experiments at the lowest vacuum attainable are fundamental in that they can help us unravel the effect of air viscosity or other surrounding gases on entrainment when dynamic wetting failure occurs. In our previous unique experiments [2] where we reduced the air pressure and recorded a reduction in air entrainment velocity, we demonstrated that the air is indeed important in air entrainment with the implication that the contact angle {{and other aspects of}} dynamic wetting may be affected by the viscosity of the air or the surrounding gas. In this paper, we follow-up on our initial study, using the same equipment [2], and present data on how the air pressure affects the velocity dependence of the contact angle and the slope angle of the saw-tooth <b>wetting</b> <b>line,</b> the two most fundamental features of wetting. Remember the slope angle of this line defines the maximum speed of wetting [3] (the speed at which the <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> advances normal to itself) and we have demonstrated how by manipulating the flow geometry we can postpone air entrainment to higher speeds [4], but whether this maximum speed is the speed at which the contact angle gets to 180 deg or a lower speed has not been established...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} {{of carbon dioxide}} to wood drying processes and chemical extraction of bark was investigated. Dissolved carbon dioxide gas supersaturation in the water of green wood was utilised in decompression drying of Pinus radiata sapwood chips and in the kiln drying of collapsesusceptible Eucalyptus delegatensis heartwood. The transport properties and solubilities of dissolved carbon dioxide gas in green wood that {{form the basis of}} such treatments were studied in Nothofagus fusca heartwood. Supercritical carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide/methanol were utilised to extract resin acid, fatty acids, and sterols from Pinus radiata bark. Non-steady state desorption of dissolved carbon dioxide gas from wood samples saturated with carbon dioxide gas under pressure was used to measure transverse diffusion coefficients of dissolved carbon dioxide gas in green Nothofagus fusca heartwood. The activation energy of dissolved carbon dioxide gas diffusion in green N. fusca heartwood was higher than the activation energy of dissolved carbon dioxide gas diffusion in water, suggesting the presence of a reaction mechanism between the dissolved carbon dioxide gas molecules and the cell wall constituents. Initial carbon dioxide gas loss after decompression is both rapid and substantial. This is due to mass flow of carbon dioxide gas bubbles from surface vessels and longitudinal diffusion, principally from the end grain. In long wood samples the majority of carbon dioxide gas is lost by transverse diffusion. A bimodal diffusion equation is proposed for modelling carbon dioxide gas absorption and desorption by longitudinal and transverse diffusion. Carbon dioxide gas solubilities in the water of green wood were similar to published values of solubilities in pure water. Carbon dioxide gas bubble nucleation in supersaturated aqueous solutions on decompression in Pinus radiata sapwood chips, partially saturated with carbon dioxide gas under pressure, was effective in removing a significant proportion of the water. The volume of gas bubbles formed was found to be an important criterion for water loss at high carbon dioxide gas solubilities. Water loss increased with gas pressure and absorption time. Large variations in water loss occurred with temperature at low gas pressure. Water loss was found to be more effective with repeated cycles of decompression drying. At low gas solubilities in water the volume of air in the wood became an important criterion for water loss. Compression and expansion of air bubbles was thought to be the main mode of water loss at low gas solubilities along with expansion of compressed gas that had moved behind the <b>wet</b> <b>line</b> through adjacent dry tracheids. The energy efficiency of decompression drying was far lower than that of compression drying with hydraulically driven platens. Drying collapse in Eucalyptus delegatensis heartwood was unaffected by carbon dioxide gas supersaturation in the sap of green wood, saturated under pressure at a range of gas solubilities and dried at different temperatures. It appears that carbon dioxide gas bubble nucleation does not occur within the water-saturated cells of impermeable heartwood. Drying temperature did {{have a significant effect on}} drying collapse, however, the response varied greatly with the wood source. Significant drying collapse and basic density variation occurred among the regions Nelson and Southland, among trees within the regions, and among height classes within the trees. The differences in drying collapse between the two regions was attributed to regional differences in the pattern of inter- and intra-incremental basic density variation, caused by strong environmental control of these wood properties. The significant variation of drying collapse among trees within regions suggests some genetic control of drying collapse. Pinus radiata bark was extracted using a once-through flow of supercritical carbon dioxide at a temperature of 50 °C and pressures from 10 to 30 MPa. Extraction was also performed with supercritical carbon dioxide containing 4. 3 % methanol as a co-solvent at 30 MPa. Extract yields increased with pressure. HPLC analysis using ultraviolet absorption identified the resin acid abietic acid, the fatty acids linoleic, linolenic, and palmitoleic acid, and the sterols β-sitosterol and campesterol as present in the extracts. The amount of each compound extracted increased with increasing pressure, with the proportion of abietic acid and β-sitosterol in the extract increasing as the pressure increased. The flavonoid dihydroquercetin was not found in the extracts, even with the addition of the co-solvent methanol...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of interfacial processes in materials joining {{has a long}} history. A significant amount of work has suggested that processes collateral to wetting can affect the extent of wetting and moderate or retard wetting rate. Even very small additions of a constituent, known to react with the substrate, cause pronounced improvement in wetting and are exploited in braze alloys, especially those used for joining to ceramics. The wide diversity of processes, such as diffusion, chemical reaction, and fluxing, and their possible combinations suggest that various rate laws should be expected for wetting kinetics depending on the controlling processes. These rate laws are expected to differ crucially from the standard fluid controlled wetting models found in the literature. Voitovitch et al. and Mortensen et al. have shown data that suggests diffusion control for some systems and reaction control for others. They also presented a model of wetting kinetics controlled by the diffusion of a constituent contained by the wetting fluid. In the following a model will be constructed for the wetting kinetics of a small droplet of metal containing a constituent that diffuses to the <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> and chemically reacts with a flat, smooth substrate. The model {{is similar to that}} of Voitovitch et al. and Mortensen et al. but incorporates chemical reaction kinetics such that the result contains both diffusion and reaction kinetics. The model is constructed in the circular cylinder coordinate system, satisfies the diffusion equation under conditions of slow flow, and considers diffusion and reaction at the <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> to be processes in series. This is done by solving the diffusion equation with proper initial and boundary conditions, computing the diffusive flux at the <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> and equating this to both the convective flux and reaction flux. This procedure is similar to equating the current flowing in components of a series circuit. The wetting rate will be computed versus time for a variety of diffusion and reaction conditions. A transition is observed from nonlinear (diffusive) to linear (reactive) behavior as the control parameters (such as the diffusion coefficient) are modified. This is in agreement with experimental observations. The adequacy of the slow flow condition, used in this type of analysis, is discussed and an amended procedure is suggested...|$|R

In the present work, we investigate what parameters of the stain or its formation can be used to characterize the specific interaction between an aqueous dispersion of beads and its receptor immobilized on the surface. We use the biotin-streptavidin system as an experimental model. Clear dissimilarities were observed in the drying sequences on streptavidin-coated substrates of droplets of aqueous solutions containing biotin-coated or streptavidin-coated beads. Fluorescent beads are used in order to visualize the fluid flow field. We show differences in the distribution of the particles on the surface depending on biomolecular interactions between beads and the solid surface. A mechanistic model is proposed to explain the different patterns obtained during drying. The model describes that the beads are left behind the receding <b>wetting</b> <b>line</b> rather than pulled towards the drop center if the biological binding force is comparable to the surface tension of the receding <b>wetting</b> <b>line.</b> Other forces such as the viscous drag, van der Waals forces, and solid–solid friction forces are found negligible.
