40|$|Allergy to <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> What are <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols?</b> <b>Wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> are the {{principle}} component of lanolin in which allergens are found. Lanolin {{is a natural}} product obtained from the fleece of sheep. Sebum is extracted from the wool, cleaned and refined to produce anhydrous lanolin. This comprises 3 parts, <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols,</b> fatty alcohols and fatty acids. Currently the <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> are considered the main sensitisers in lanolin but whether they are the sole sensitisers, needs further investigation. Nowadays there is also chemically modified lanolin that may be less sensitising than natural lanolin. <b>Wool</b> <b>alcohols,</b> wool fat, anhydrous lanolin, lanolin alcohol, wool wax and wool grease {{are just some of}} the terms used interchangeably with lanolin. In this article we will use <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols,</b> as it is this fraction of lanolin that is the main cause of contact allergies. What products contain <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols?</b> Lanolin is a good emulsifier; this means it binds well with water thus it is particularly useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. <b>Wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> are found in many pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics and toiletries. They also have some industrial uses...|$|E
40|$|Background: Data on contact allergies in {{children}} are conflicting. This study aims to identify frequent contact allergens and their relevance {{in children}} with and without atopic dermatitis (AD). This will allow better identification of potential sensitizers and improve patients' care in children. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 1083 patient records of children aged 0 - 18 years suspected of having contact dermatitis. Children were patch tested between 1996 - 2013 in 3 University Hospitals in the Netherlands. Patch testing was performed using the Chamber technique and the TRUE test. Patients were excluded (n = 71) when not tested with at minimum the European Baseline Series. Results of additional patch tested series, tested “on indication” according to the patient history, were also evaluated. The primary analysis was performed on routinely tested allergens, while the secondary analysis {{was performed on the}} combined data from routinely tested allergens plus allergens tested “on indication”. Provided relevance scores are the current “certain” and “probable” relevance scores combined. Statistical analysis was performed with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results: 1012 children (female 63 %, mean age 13 years) were included, and 469 (46 %) of children developed ≥ 1 positive reaction. The most frequent reactions were to nickel (16, 4 %: 164 / 998), cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) (15, 9 %: 54 / 339), fragrance mix I (9, 9 %: 100 / 1008), Amerchol L- 101 (8, 8 %: 30 / 339) and <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> (6, 2 %: 63 / 1009). 52 % of children had AD, 39 % did not have AD and in 9 % had an unknown atopic status. Sensitization rates for children with and without AD were similar (48 % vs. 47 %). In children with AD, CAPB was the most frequent allergen (19 %; 33 / 174). Compared to children without AD, the primary analysis showed no significant difference. However, when analyzing all reactions to CAPB found in the routinely tested series plus the “on indication” tested series together, a significant difference between children with and without AD was seen for CAPB (17 % vs. 9 %; p < 0. 02). Reactions to CAPB were considered relevant in the majority of cases (56 %). Reactions to <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> (p < 0. 04) and fragrances (p < 0. 05) were found significantly more often {{in children with}} AD vs. children without AD, with relevance scores of at least 59 % and 63 %, respectively. Surprisingly, less positive reactions to <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> and fragrances were found with the TRUE test as compared to the Chamber technique. Conclusion: Sensitisation rates in children with and without AD were similar, but significant differences were found in the reacting allergens between these 2 groups. Reactions to CAPB, fragrances and <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> are more common in children with AD, and these should be tested when a contact dermatitis is suspected in this population. The difference in positive reactions to <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> and fragrances between TRUE test and Chamber technique is striking and needs further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Contact {{sensitization}} {{in children}} is frequent. However, because exposure to sensitizing agents varies rapidly, {{it is of}} utmost importance to perform a periodic evaluation of patch test results. Our purpose was to compare our data on contact sensitization in children during the past 7 years to our previous 1988 - 1994 findings, {{in order to identify}} emerging allergens and update our pediatric series. From 1995 to 2001, 1094 consecutive children were examined. Of these, 997 patients were patch tested with our pediatric series, which includes 30 allergens, whereas 97 underwent patch testing with 46 allergens. A total of 570 children proved allergic (52. 1 %). The highest sensitization rate was observed in children under 3 years of age. No differences between atopic dermatitis patients and nonatopic ones were observed in the sensitization rate. Neomycin, nickel, <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols,</b> thimerosal, and ammoniated mercury gave most of the positive responses. With respect to 1988 - 1995 data, allergy to substances such as neomycin, nickel, <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols,</b> thimerosal, ammoniated mercury, propolis, potassium dichromate, and thiuram mix proved more frequent. In conclusion, as sensitization rates to different allergens show great variations over time, periodic evaluations of patch test results in children is necessary in order to update the test trays...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Seven women with PCV underwent patch tests with the Italian standard series and with additional batteries of allergens (perfumes, preservatives, emulsifiers, medicaments and corticosteroid series). RESULTS: One patient experienced a positive reaction t o balsam of Peru and <b>wool</b> <b>alcohol.</b> CONCLUSION: Patch testing is not normally {{necessary in the}} management of PCV. However, when a patient with PCV complains of burning or pruritus after application of topical products, patch tests could prove useful...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{concerns}} {{contact sensitization}} in soldiers, {{the frequency of}} which is poorly documented. During a six-year period, 128 patients of age range 17 - 50 years were patch tested with the Indian standard battery of 30 allergens. We obtained a reaction in 23 (18 &#x 0025;) of our patients. Nickel sulfate, fragrance mix, <b>wool</b> <b>alcohol</b> and parthenium induced most of the positive responses. In addition, an irritant reaction was seen in 16 (12. 5 &#x 0025;) of our patients. Patients of atopic dermatitis and hand/foot dermatoses evoked a high sensitivity response. Adverse effects were seen in 15 patients...|$|R
5000|$|Acetylated lanolin alcohol, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "sheep alcohol", lanolin <b>alcohol</b> or <b>wool</b> <b>alcohol,</b> is a non-drying organic compound produced from lanolin, the fat of wool shearings, {{which has been}} reacted with acetic acid and {{a small amount of}} lye. There are synthetic variants available; however, the animal-derived product has more anti-allergenic tendencies. Acetylated lanolin alcohol is used as an emollient, to soften skin, but is mildly comedogenic, with a rating of 0-2 out of 5. For this reason, those who are prone to whiteheads and blackheads should patch test before using on a large scale. Acetylated lanolin alcohol can also be inflammatory to those with wool or lanolin allergies, and should be avoided in such cases.|$|R
40|$|Our study {{concerns}} {{contact sensitization}} in children, {{the frequency of}} which is still debated in the literature, even though specific reports are increasing, During a 7 year period (1988 - 1994) 670 patients, 6 months to 12 years of age, were patch tested with the European standard series, integrated with 24 haptens, at the same concentrations as for adults, We observed positive results in 42 % of our patients, Thimerosal, nickel sulfate, Kathon CG, fragrance mix, neomycin, <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols,</b> and ammoniated mercury induced most of the positive responses, The highest sensitization rate was found in children from 0 to 3 years of age, Comments on main positive haptens are reported, Seventy-seven percent of our sensitized patients were atopics, suggesting that atopy represents a predisposing factor for contact hypersensitivity. Patch testing represents a useful diagnostic procedure for the definition of childhood eczematous dermatitis and for the identification of agents inducing contact sensitization which is frequently associated with atopic dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Background. Contact {{allergy and}} {{sensitization}} are frequent {{in the general}} adult population, but there are few studies on this prevalence among children. To evaluate the frequency of allergic contact sensitization to standard chemical allergens in children and to compare data in children with atopic dermatitis and healthy controls, we performed patch tests with standard chemical allergens. This study {{was the first in}} Lithuania to investigate the prevalence of contact sensitization in children. Materials and Methods. A total of 194 children ranging from 3 to 17 years in age were enrolled in the study. Results. At least 1 positive reaction was observed in 15 % in the control group and 55 % in the atopic dermatitis group. The most prevalent allergens in atopic dermatitis and healthy groups were: nickel sulfate (18. 2 % and 10 %, respectively), cobalt chloride (13. 8 % and 4 %), chromium (12. 8 % and 9 %), fragrance mix (11. 8 % and 3 %), <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> (11. 8 % and 6 %), thimerosal 10. 8 % and 6 %). Conclusions. Contact sensitization is quite common in general children po-pulation. Atopic dermatitis was found to be a predisposing factor for contact sensitization in children. Systematic patch-testing should be performed for ato-pic dermatitis patients, and appropriate preventive measures should be taken to avoid contact with potential allergens.

40|$|Background and Design: Patch {{testing is}} {{valuable}} {{in the diagnosis}} of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) {{as well as in}} determining the causative agent and thus is helpful in prevention of the disease and also provides information for the patient Material and Method: Hundred and sixty-eight patients (94 female and 74 male) with ACD were patch tested with European standard series. Patch test result were assessed according to suggestion of International Contact Dermatitis Research Group at 48 and 72 hours after initial application. Results: Of the patients, 64. 3 % were between 16 - 45 years of age and majority of the lesions (57. 1 %) were localized on the hands. A total of 86 (51. 1 %) patients had one or more positive patch test reactions. The most common allergens were nickel sulfate (20. 2 %) followed by potassium dichromate (8. 3 %), cobalt chloride (7. 1 %), fragrance mix (7. 1 %), paraphenylendiamine base (6 %), paraben mix 3. 6 %), N-isopropyl-N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (3. 6 %), <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> (3. 6 %), formaldehyde (3. 6 %), quaternium- 15 (3. 6 %). Positive reactions to nickel sulfate were more common among women, especially those in younger group. Frequency of contact allergy to neomycin sulfate, epoxy resin, 4 -tert-butylphenolformaldehyde resin, sesquiterpenelactone mix, primin, 5 -chloro- 2 -methyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 - 1, budesonide, lyral were relatively low (1. 2 %), while no positive reaction was obtained to clioquinol and methyldibromoglutaronitrile in any case. Conclusion: Since no similar study has been previously performed in our area, this study provides information about contact allergen profile in patients underwent skin patch test with a diagnosis of AKD at Yozgat. The most frequent allergens detected with ASS and frequency rates may vary among different facilities at various cities of Turkey. A standard series for our country may be created after assessment of regional variability by new studies conducted in same time zone...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Elimination of allergens/topical {{medications}} causing {{contact dermatitis}} in venous eczema, which poses {{a significant problem}} in its chronicity and treatment, provides the basis for better therapeutic outcome. Our objective {{was to determine the}} pattern of contact sensitization in venous eczema patients in Himachal Pradesh (India). Methods: Thirty-four patients (M:F, 31 : 3) and 10 controls (M:F, 6 : 4) were patch tested with Indian standard series and 10 commonly used topical medicaments. Results: Positive patch test results were seen in 50 &#x 0025; (M:F, 16 : 1) of the patients. Common allergens were Fragrance mix (15 &#x 0025;), p-phenylendiamine (15 &#x 0025;), nickel (9 &#x 0025;), <b>wool</b> <b>alcohol</b> (9 &#x 0025;), chinoform (9 &#x 0025;), balsum of Peru (5 &#x 0025;), cobalt chloride (5 &#x 0025;), potassium dichromate (3 &#x 0025;), epoxy resin (3 &#x 0025;), thiuram mix (3 &#x 0025;) and formaldehyde (3 &#x 0025;). Only sisomycin and miconazole among the topical medications elicited a positive patch test reaction in 3 and 5 &#x 0025; patients, respectively. Neomycin contact sensitivity was not seen in any of the patients. One patient who had exacerbation of venous eczema following accidental application of topical diclofenac showed a positive patch test reaction to it. Conclusions: Patch test should be used to identify the topical agents that may be responsible for perpetuation or aggravation of eczema, especially in patients who do not improve despite adequate treatment of other underlying cause(s) ...|$|R
50|$|Cholecalciferol is {{produced}} industrially {{for use in}} vitamin supplements and to fortify foods. As a pharmaceutical drug it is called cholecalciferol (USAN) or colecalciferol (INN, BAN). It {{is produced}} by the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol extracted from lanolin found in sheep's wool. Cholesterol is extracted from wool grease and <b>wool</b> wax <b>alcohols</b> obtained from the cleaning of wool after shearing. The cholesterol undergoes a four-step process to make 7-dehydrocholesterol, the same compound that is produced in the skin of animals. The 7-dehydrocholesterol is then irradiated with ultraviolet light. Some unwanted isomers are formed during irradiation: these are removed by various techniques, leaving a resin which melts at about room temperature and usually has a potency of 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 International Units per gram.|$|R
40|$|<b>Wool</b> keratin/poly(vinyl <b>alcohol)</b> (PVA) blend nanofibers were {{fabricated}} {{using the}} electrospinning method in formic acid solutions with different weight ratios of keratin to PVA. The resultant blend nanofibers {{were characterized by}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile test. SEM images showed that {{the diameter of the}} blend nanofibers was affected by the content of keratin in blend solution. FTIR and XRD analyses data demonstrated that there were good interactions between keratin and PVA in the blended nanofibers caused by possibly hydrogen bonds. The TGA study revealed that the thermal stability of the blend nanofibers was between those of keratin and PVA. Tensile test indicated that the addition of PVA was able to improve the mechanical properties of the electrospun nanofibers...|$|R
40|$|Previously, the {{interest}} in in vivo/in vitro correlations in the dermal field of research has increased steadily. Unfortunately, {{in most cases the}} skin from different human donors was taken for in vivo and in vitro experiments, which led to problems concerning the interindividual variability of the skin. Therefore, we established a methodology to utilize the same skin for both sets of data. In time dependency, drug amounts in the stratum corneum and the deeper skin layers were determined from eight donors using the same skin area for in vivo and the corresponding in vitro tests. Penetration experiments were carried out with the lipophilic drug flufenamic acid dissolved in <b>wool</b> <b>alcohols</b> ointment as the model formulation, which was administered to the skin under “infinite dose” conditions. At different time points prior to starting the surgery, the drug preparation was applied topically on the edges of the skin area, which was planned for excision using Finn chambers. After anesthetizing the patient and disinfecting the operation area, the incubated skin pieces were cut off first and immediately frozen to limit further drug diffusion. In vitro experiments were performed on the remaining skin flap, using two different test systems, a penetration and a permeation model. At the end of all experiments (in vivo and in vitro) the skin specimens were segmented horizontally and the drug was extracted and quantified. The in vivo and in vitro drug amounts in the stratum corneum and the deeper skin layers, respectively, were compared. The inevitable use of unknown volumes of disinfectant in vivo (medical reasons) might be the reason why a correlation failed for the stratum corneum. Nevertheless, for both in vitro test systems a direct linear correlation was found for the deeper skin layers, which showed slopes of a = 3. 2272 ± 0. 3933 (penetration model vs in vivo) and a = 1. 7776 ± 0. 1926 (permeation model vs in vivo). This difference demonstrates the varying influence of the test systems and represents a factor about which in vivo and in vitro data are shifted against each other. As far as the model drug flufenamic acid is concerned, this methodology represents a tool to predict drug penetration into the deeper skin layers in vivo after carrying out corresponding in vitro experiments. Therefore, the potential is given {{to reduce the number of}} in vivo experiments, the risk for the volunteers, and the costs for the development of new drug preparations...|$|E
