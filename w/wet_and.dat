Randomized Complete Design (RCD) by two factors treatments with two replications is used in this research. Factor I was soil reactiveness that is define as (a) low reactive= R 1; (b) moderate reactive =R 2; (c) strong reactive= R 3, and (d) very strong reactive= R 4 respectively. Factor II was drying, <b>wetting,</b> <b>and</b> diluting that is define as (1) drying continuously after wetting = W 1, (2) wetting continuously = W 2; (3) drying after weeting and diluting =W 3; <b>and</b> (4) <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> diluting. The result of experiments show that continuous drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) <b>and</b> drying after <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> diluting (W 3) or continuous weeting (W 2) gave soils pH lower than the weeting and diluting (W 4).

The continouos drying after wetting (W 1) can increase EC (electrical conductivity) higher than the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> diluting (W 3). The continouos <b>wetting</b> (W 2) <b>and</b> the continouos drying after wetting (W 1) has given the total soluble acidity of 63, 30 dan 61, 71 cmolc kg- 1 respectively, higher than drying after <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> diluting (W 3) <b>and</b> <b>wetting</b> thatfollowed diluting (W 4) that given total soluble acidity of 54, 03 and 51, 95 cmolc kg- 1 respectively.

40|$|Rice grows {{well under}} certain {{condition}} and environment including soil, water and nutrients. Some researches {{have shown that}} traditional method with continues flooding need tremen- deous amount of water for rice cultivation and gives low water productivity. To increase the water productivity, number of water saving iriga- tion techniques have been studied and applied. Study on effect of number of water irrigation treatments on water productivity of rice was carried out. Eight irrigation treatments were conducted for growing rice in pot experiment i. e. shallow intermittent irrigation (SII), alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying (AWD 1, AWD 2, AWD 3 and AWD 4), shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying (SWD 1 and SWD 2), and semi-dry cultiva- tion (SDC). The performance of those treat- ments in terms of agronomic and water pa- rameters was compared to the shallow inter- mittent irrigation as a control method. The study reveals that the shallow intermittent irrigation needs the highest amount of water compare with other treatments. The lowest amount of water was achieved under the semi-dry cultivation. It could save water up to 18. 4 % compare to the control treatment. By using the alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying and the shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying treatments, irrigated water can be reduced up to 13. 1 % and 5. 4 %, respec- tively. The highest grain was obtained by alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying (AWD 4) and the semi-dry cultivation yielded the smalest grain. On average the alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying and shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying increased the grain yield by 22. 9 % and 17. 9 %, whereas the semi-dry cultivation reduced the yield up to 14 % compare to the shallow water depth treatment. The alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying treatments have significantly improved the water produc- tivity by 41. 6 %, shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> drying increased by 24. 2 % relative to the shallow intermittent irrigation treatment, whereas the most saving water treatment i. e. the semi- dry cultivation performed quite similar with the shallow water depth treatment, {{as a result of}} low grain yields under the treatment...|$|R

5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping.
