500|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit {{schools and}} {{believed she was}} well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E
500|$|After {{a string}} of films {{in which she was}} cast to add glamour, Kaif {{appeared}} in Kabir Khan's terrorism drama New York (2009). Featuring John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh in lead roles, the film tells the story of how three friends' lives are changed when the former is wrongly detained after 9/11. Kaif played Maya, a college student who later marries a terrorist. The actress said that she identified with Maya, since she experienced similar isolation because of her skin colour <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in London. Kaif also remarked that she was tired of [...] "arm candy" [...] roles and was looking for more substantial parts. New York did well at the box office and received favourable reviews. According to Subhash K. Jha, Kaif [...] "comes into her own as an actress of substance... From the carefree effervescent campus girl to the anguished wife, Katrina makes the journey look plausible all the way". New York brought Kaif her first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actress. She then appeared in a cameo for India's first underwater thriller Blue.|$|E

500|$|Described {{as one of}} [...] "R's most {{important}} artists" [...] during the 1990s, her second studio album, One in a Million, {{became one of the}} most influential R albums of the decade. Music critic Simon Reynolds cited [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] as [...] "the most radical pop single" [...] of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah [...] "knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line", and consequently [...] "helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'." [...] Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah [...] "had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years." [...] Music publication Popdust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground due mainly to her influence on the underground alternative music scene, which consists of heavy sampling and references to her music by underground artists. Popdust also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive mentioned that it's easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R movements. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the nicknames [...] "Princess of R" [...] and [...] "Queen of Urban Pop", as she [...] "proved she was a muse in her own right". Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone dubbed her as the [...] "undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on". Aaliyah has been referred to as a pop icon and a R icon for her impact and contributions to those respective genres. Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada has said several times that [...] "It was when I heard Aaliyah's Age Ain't Nothing but a Number that I got hooked on R", after which Utada released her debut album First Love with heavy R influences. Another Japanese pop singer Crystal Kay has expressed how she admired Aaliyah <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> and how she would practice dancing while watching her music videos.|$|E
2500|$|Hopper {{has been}} widely {{reported}} to be the godfather of actress Amber Tamblyn; in a 2009 interview with Parade, Tamblyn explained that [...] "godfather" [...] was [...] "just a loose term" [...] for Hopper, Dean Stockwell and Neil Young, three famous friends of her father's, who were always around the house <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> and who were big influences on her life.|$|E
2500|$|Dupré {{spent her}} early {{childhood}} years in Beachwood, New Jersey, a borough near the Jersey Shore. Her father, William Youmans, owned a landscaping business and also {{worked as a}} salesman of surfing accessories. When her parents divorced, Dupré moved to Wall Township, New Jersey with her mother, Carolyn Capalbo, and her stepfather, Mike DiPietro, an oral surgeon. There, she attended Old Mill (elementary) School and Wall High School until her sophomore year, when she moved to Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, {{to live with her}} father. On her MySpace page, Dupré described leaving home at age 17 to escape a broken family and abuse, but her aunt, Barbara Youmans of Seaside Heights, denied that Dupré had a difficult childhood. [...] "She never had a bad life <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> She had the best of everything: bicycles, clothing, O'Neill surf boards. ... She was always dressed to kill and got everything she wanted." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{left ankle}} seemed broken. The stirrup was heavy, {{and as soon}} as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tired <b>she</b> could no longer keep its weight from drawing her foot in. The inside of her right knee was as sore as a boil. Besides, she had other pains, just as severe, and she stood {{momentarily}} in mortal dread of that terrible stitch in her side. If it returned she knew she would fall off. But, fortunately, just <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> weak and dizzy, the horses ahead slowed to a walk on a descent. The road wound down into a wide deep canyon. Carley had a respite from her severest pains. Never before had she known {{what it meant to be}} so grateful for relief from anything.|$|R

500|$|Eddy {{responded to}} the early {{installments}} in McClure's by challenging its description of her father, early family life, and the issues surrounding her marriages. McClure's had said that the Bible was the only book in the house <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up; on the contrary, she wrote, {{her father was a}} great reader. To counter McClure's claim that her childhood home had provided a [...] "lonely and unstimulating existence", her statement described the educational and professional achievements of her family. In response to McClure's description of her as bad tempered, she offered as an example of her own kindness that a housekeeper of the family's had resigned because Eddy allowed a blind girl, who had knocked on the door and was unknown to the family, to stay with them.|$|R
2500|$|Andy Pryor, {{the casting}} director, {{suggested}} Gillan to Moffat after her {{performance in the}} fourth series episode [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", in which she played a soothsayer, but Moffat originally thought Gillan was [...] "short and dumpy". Later, however, he stated that she was [...] "exactly right for the role", though she portrayed the character differently from how Moffat originally wrote. Gillan was reportedly the last to audition for the role, and stood out as she was [...] "a bit kookier" [...] than the others. Moffat said of the casting, [...] "We saw some amazing actresses for this part. But when Karen came through the door, the game was up— she was funny, clever, gorgeous and sexy. Or Scottish, which is the quick way of saying it. A generation of little girls will want to be her. And a generation of little boys will {{want them to be}} her too." [...] Doctor Who executive producer and drama chief at BBC Wales Piers Wenger concurred, [...] "We knew Karen was perfect for the role the moment we saw her. She brought an energy and excitement to the part that was just fantastic." [...] Gillan was aware of the show but was not as big a fan of it as her mother was, due to it not being on <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> However, she watched some with her mother after it returned in 2005, and was also a fan of other science fiction such as The X-Files, The Outer Limits, [...] and [...]|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, NUVOtv {{announced}} a premier partnership with entertainer and entrepreneur Jennifer Lopez, which {{would focus on}} appealing the network's programming to a modern, Latino audience that is [...] "growing rapidly {{and in need of}} new, high-quality content". Lopez would work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing on programs featured on the network's programming. According to The Huffington Post, with a growing Latino audience, [...] "there is more demand for television programming around that audience. Until now, there have only been a few networks focused on this demographic, and really none focused on providing Latino cultural content in English". Lopez told USA Today that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> there was very little programming that appealed to her heritage, stating that: [...] "Growing up in the Bronx as a little Puerto Rican girl watching TV and not having a lot to identify with. West Side Story was really my favorite thing because it had Puerto Ricans in it". Lopez explained that her partnership with nuvoTV marked a natural step in her career. [...] "I'm in this business and I do know this business on many different levels – in music, in television, in film production, and as an actress, and in so many different ways, even in fashion. It's kind of right up my alley," [...] she said. Lopez was named as chief creative officer of the network on May 16, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{her other}} {{photographs}} containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in [...] "The Perfect Tomato," [...] the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie’s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.|$|E

5000|$|THE DIG (2008), Mattie's {{older brother}} Jamie told her stories of ancient myths <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing.</b> As a lonely girl of {{fourteen}} she {{said goodbye to}} Jamie married and flew across the globe {{to pursue a career}} in archaeology. On a dig in Lebanon in 1968, he had a break with reality and changed profoundly. As the play begins in 1998, an international inquiry compels Mattie, now married and working for the family business in Chicago, to investigate the provenance of an ancient pot found on Jamie's Dig. The process brings to the surface her buried feelings of abandonment and questions about his breakdown - and reveals the underlying power of the myths that he once taught her. Through scenes inter-splicing time and place, the play explores psychology, mythology and relationship. As Mattie strives to protect Jamie from a potentially traumatic trial, she remembers him as the loving brother before the Dig. She recalls the stories of the stars and Greek myths he told her as a child and ultimately learns to accept him as he is.|$|R

50|$|She quickly {{learns that}} she and several other nursing home {{residents}} had {{signed an agreement with}} Dr. Jimson and Dr. Reed to participate in a study for an experimental drug (PT-1) that reverses the effect of aging by making telomeres grow. All the residents at the nursing home had been given the drug and <b>are</b> now <b>growing</b> younger each day. However, because the drug is experimental, it must be kept a secret. While a second chance at life seems wonderful, when Amelia's first birthday while moving back in time arrives, she finds she cannot remember anything from the last year of her life <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> older. The residents realize that as they grow younger, their previous memories are disappearing and being rewritten with new memories from growing younger, even though the brain has plenty of chromosomes left for memory. It's then found out that it's like recording while hitting the rewind button. One man, afraid of forgetting his beloved wife's funeral where so many people said such nice things, is the first to request the Cure, a secondary drug that will halt his age at that exact moment. While the Cure works successfully on lab mice, the man immediately shrivels up, dies, and turns into dust when it is administered to him.|$|R
