5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in outer <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
25|$|Items were {{substituted}} with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer to {{make the}} aircraft lighter than a Kitfox Lite. This included the tailwheel leaf spring, wing spars, <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> (aluminum on later kits), lift struts, firewall, elevator and fuel tank. A variety of engines may be used such as the Hirth F33, Hirth F-23, Zanzottera MZ 34, 1/2 Volkswagen air-cooled engine and the Zanzottera MZ 201.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of metal}} for {{airframe}} construction {{was by no}} means uncommon: Robert Esnault-Pelterie used steel tubing to construct the fuselage of his aircraft as early as 1907, and Louis Breguet was another notable pioneer of metal construction, using steel channel sections for fuselage construction, steel tube for wing spars, pressed aluminium for <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> and aluminium sheeting for fuselage covering - this would not be improved upon until the second half of 1915.|$|E

40|$|Students of the Aviation Department at Purdue University {{enroll in}} a {{computer}} graphics course (CGT 162) during their freshmen year, and in this course {{they learn how to}} use the CATIA V 5 Solid modeling software. CATIA V 5 solid modeling software is used extensively in the aerospace industry to design aircraft and aircraft parts. The authors of this paper have incorporated a new project in the AT 166 Aircraft Materials II course to reinforce the knowledge gained in the introductory course and to apply this new skill set to design, and manufacture an aluminum alloy formed <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> using CNC equipment and conventional sheet metal equipment. For this project students select a wing airfoil using commercial available software based on assigned parameters like gross weight, cruise speed and stall speed. An airfoil for a small piston powered experimental aircraft is selected with a maximum gross weight of 500 pounds, cruise speed of 150 mph, and a stall speed of 50 mph. Airfoil optimizer software is used to download the drawings of the selected airfoil. The CATIA V 5 part design workbench is used to model the <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> form blocks, and the sheet metal design workbench is used to model the formed <b>wing</b> <b>rib.</b> A complete set of engineering drawings is generated to manufacture the parts. The flat pattern layout of the <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> is cut with a CNC mill, and the <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> is formed by using form blocks, and a press brake. The authors have noticed that students quickly lose the knowledge acquired during the introductory CGT course, if they don’t use it. By introducing new coursework that builds on existing knowledge, they hope to improve the student’s knowledge of design software and CNC machining. The students are introduced to a complete manufacturing cycle from conceptual design to the actual manufacture of the part...|$|R

The MSB {{requires}} addition of new <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> and modifications to the wing attachment structure for the first 228 Cessna 162s delivered. The modification was extensive and required 32 man-hours to complete and was required to be done within the next 100 flight hours or at the next annual inspection, whichever came first. Cessna paid to modify all aircraft involved.|$|E
25|$|The Avid Flyer is a {{conventional}} layout, single engine, {{side by side}} two seat light aircraft, with a strut-braced high wing configuration. Aluminum tubes serve as leading edge/main spar and rear spar, each wing being supported {{by a pair of}} tubular lift struts. Sawn plywood <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> are bonded to the aluminum tube spars using a filled epoxy compound. The Avid Flyer features Junkers style one-piece flaperons supported by three offset hinge arms. The Junkers design moves the control surfaces well underneath the wing, where they remain in undisturbed smooth airflow at low speed and/or higher climb angles.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Aircraft Sales and Parts (ASAP) of Vernon, British Columbia {{purchased}} the Beaver tooling and redesigned the RX 550.

50|$|The Titch is a single-seat low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all wood construction {{similar to}} the Monoplane but has fewer metal fittings than the earlier design and full size <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> plans are supplied for the tapered wing panels. With a cruise speed {{in the region of}} 160 mph (260 km/h), it is an effective cross-country touring aircraft and is also fully aerobatic. Builders can fit it with either a Continental or a Lycoming engine.|$|R
25|$|On 29 October 1917, Leutnant der Reserve Heinrich Gontermann, Staffelführer of Jasta 15, was {{performing}} aerobatics when his triplane broke up. Gontermann was fatally {{injured in the}} ensuing crash landing. Leutnant der Reserve Günther Pastor of Jasta 11 was killed two days later when his triplane broke up in level flight. Inspection of the wrecked aircraft showed that the wings had been poorly constructed. Examination of other high-time triplanes confirmed these findings. On 2 November, Idflieg grounded all remaining triplanes pending an inquiry. Idflieg convened a Sturzkommission (crash commission) which concluded that poor construction and lack of waterproofing had allowed moisture to damage the wing structure. This caused the <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> to disintegrate and the ailerons to break away in flight.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{structure}} of the Hurricane's cantilever wing consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness. The wing was described by aviation publication Flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars, after which the <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and rear spars. Hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the inner end of the wings. The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its leading edge. The majority of the Flight control surfaces, such as the Frise-type ailerons, also had fabric coverings.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 Nieuport {{produced}} a {{design for a}} single-seat sesquiplane fighter of mixed construction, the Nieuport-Delage NiD 42, which was ordered in small numbers for the French air force, entering service in 1927. Nieuport developed three refined versions in 1927, the all-metal NiD-52 and NiD-72 and the mixed construction Nieuport-Delage NiD 62. Like the NiD 42 on which it was based, the NiD 52 was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Hb V12 engine, but the wooden monocoque rear fuselage was replaced by an equivalent made of duralumin and the wooden <b>wing</b> <b>ribs</b> by light alloy, while retaining a fabric covering. Both the main and secondary wings were of reduced area compared to the NiD-42, and an enlarged tail fitted {{in an attempt to}} improve the aircraft's handling. Armament remained two 7.7mm Vickers machine guns.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} with fabric covered 4130 steel tube structure and spruce <b>wing</b> spars. <b>Ribs</b> are plywood with cap strips.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings are}} a fully {{cantilevered}} design. The outer wing panels, 6 {{feet in length}} each, are detachable to facilitate ground transportation. To simplify construction, each <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> is a single piece and slides onto the main spar, a technique that helps in rib alignment. The main spar utilizes a special channel that allows the outer wings to flex and minimizes the amount of material required for bracing. The Teenie Two is not equipped with flaps.|$|R

To simplify construction, each <b>wing</b> <b>rib</b> {{is a single}} piece and slides onto the main spar. This technique helps in rib alignment. The main spar utilizes a special channel that allows the outer wings to flex and minimizes the amount of material required to brace the wings. Additionally, the airplane is not equipped with flaps. The tail features an all flying tailplane, or stabilator.|$|R
25|$|The rear COW gun {{mounting}} {{was installed}} immediately aft of the wing, in a fixed mount that only {{allowed for a}} limited adjustment of the angle. A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, {{in the manner of}} the Schräge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install the gun at an angle at which the body lift of the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the effect of gravity, straightening the trajectory. The first firing trials resulted in several broken <b>wing</b> <b>ribs,</b> and a special rubber-spring shield was developed to protect the upper wing.|$|E
