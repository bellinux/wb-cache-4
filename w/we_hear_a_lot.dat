From its inception, compulsory schooling in the United States has always served the values of our nation’s dominant institutions and the interests of the social, political, and economic elites who own, control, and benefit most from the social arrangements and relations engendered by those institutions. To organize and operate a set of institutions dedicated to promoting critical and creative thought would run counter to those dominant values and interests by developing the cognitive habits among the population that could render them less susceptible to easy government and corporate manipulation. Therefore, so long as those values and interests remain dominant within the larger society, they will remain dominant within schools, thereby limiting the extent to which schools will ever nurture creativity and critical reflection...|$|E

And while platforms such as YouTube have been celebrated (and censored) for their ability to make protest visible through dispersed affective networks, the increasingly commercialized channel structure raises questions about the sustainability of ordinary acts of protest in the long term. This article examines a case study of peripheral anarchist political activism that moves through and beyond critical events. The study applies methods of video content analysis, qualitative analysis of comments and interactions, and visual analysis of selected videos to examine emergent “affective publics,” drawing on Daniel Stern’s notion of vitality affects...|$|E

We also hear a lot about a group of 1960 s conceptualists called the Artist Placement Group, who brokered some of the earliest artists’ residencies in industry and government in the UK. In 1966, when APG was founded, the art world regarded ‘tangling with the dirt’ of commerce and the public sector as an anomaly, even an aberration within art. Today, on the other hand, such tangling has come to define large swathes of artistic practice. Operating with few precedents, APG worked hard to formulate a rigorous methodology of engagement – one that makes many of today’s ubiquitous residencies appear complacent, and complicit, by comparison. With art having long since burst its disciplinary banks, APG’s early excursions outside the white cube’s perimeter also shed light on the emerging hybrid landscape of business art, art & science, socially engaged art and even network art. This summer, Josephine Berry and Pauline van Mourik Broekman talked to APG co-founders Barbara Steveni and John Latham, both artists in their own right, and discovered their sometimes quite different approaches to the organisation and its implication...|$|E

To explain this unlikely sounding proposition, I shall first analyze an incentive structure that is only now gaining explicit recognition in commercial real estate. Then I shall describe a two-hundred-year empirical trend to show how the above scenario is actually being played out. Finally, I shall explain why this is of more than mildly academic interest. In light of the incentives at play, the on-going historical trend has unexpected and important social implications. It does not matter that the incentive structure I am about to describe is in its infancy, for as always it is the trend, rather than any given stage of development, that is significant. However, before tracing out the logic of these incentives, a key term calls for definition. For a moment, let us talk abstractly about land. Social anthropologist living in Tonopah, Nevada...|$|E
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{political}} declarations stating {{the importance of}} developing an innovation economy by fostering venture capital inflows. But {{it is obvious that}} the venture capital market makes an extremely low contribution in terms of total R&D spending or gross investment. Thus, theory says venture capital investment (VCI) is important due to its huge impact on modernization, but practitioners note that there is no evidence and VCI constitutes about 1 % of total investments. Formal logic foregrounds the thesis that the effect of venture investment is important and significant, but delayed. We contribute to the theory and discussion of the problem of choosing between venture and non-venture funding by determining a specific niche for venture capital investment. We derive lagged regression models for GDP and patent applications for the US and Russia, to test VCI’s impact on economic growth and innovation. Comparison of model estimates shows significant VCI influence on GDP at a 4 - 6 - year lag and no synchronous influence, valid for both the US and Russia. We prove the main hypothesis of our research: the effect of venture investment on economic and innovation development parameters is significant and much greater than that of ‘conventional’ investment...|$|E

The debate, of course, is not a new one and can be boiled down (admittedly rather simplistically) to an argument over the seeming trade-off between the values of “liberty ” and “security. ” In the past, philosophers seemed to examine these societal goods not only in terms of intrinsic worth both also in terms of their instrumental value in the lives of the members of a society. 4 The “trade-off ” was indeed complex. For much of current scholarship, however, liberty and security are for the most part treated only as intrinsic goods. 5 Those who favor national security argue that security is of principal importance since, they argue, liberty itself cannot be enjoyed without a base level of security. Those who favor civil liberties argue that to restrict liberty for the sake of security defeats the purpose of supposedly needing security in order to maintain liberty.
