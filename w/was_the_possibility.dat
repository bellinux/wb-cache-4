5|$|There were {{experimental}} test operations {{set up to}} see if {{the idea}} was feasible; however, the technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in the nineteenth-century to operate such a system. Another disadvantage <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of power loss caused by wire breaks or electrical equipment failures – which often happened during storms. The nineteenth-century idea to replace the existing steam fire engines with electric ones was ahead of its time and never moved forward.|$|E
5|$|By August12, the NHC {{reported}} that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after {{a burst of}} deep convection over the center. At this point, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm; however, in a post-storm analysis, {{it was determined that}} the system had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40mph (65km/h) for 12hours on August12. Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August13, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but noted that there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of regeneration.|$|E
5|$|For the 20002001 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl {{had the right}} to select the No. 2 bowl-eligible team from both the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the Big East Conference. The bowl game's administrators also had a contract to include Notre Dame if that school met certain entry requirements. The conference champions of the ACC and Big East were guaranteed a spot in a Bowl Championship Series game, and there also <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of an at-large BCS selection for any team in each conference if it finished high enough in the BCS Poll but did not win the conference championship.|$|E

5|$|In July 1956, Nasser {{unilaterally}} nationalised the Suez Canal. The {{response of}} Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt {{that would give}} Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal. Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives, UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.|$|E
5|$|Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1999college {{football}} season with raised expectations. In 1998, the Hokies had gone 93 {{during the regular}} season and had posted a 52 record against fellow Big East Conference teams. The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which {{was supposed to be a}} rebuilding year—in the 1998 Music City Bowl, where the Hokies defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 387. With the addition of redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick to a team that had allowed an average of just 12.9points per game on defense, there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that Tech could improve upon its previous season's performance. Sports Illustrated, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami for the Big East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to the first game of the season.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{organised}} {{themselves into}} powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations {{to be largely}} unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the Manigramam, the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam. Local guilds were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled Ainnurruvar, {{also known as the}} 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations (Vira Bananjudharma or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions (prasasti). Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.|$|E

The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{incidents}} in recent years where the river has been polluted and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that this was not the first time building work had affected the river, and that there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout.|$|E
5|$|Although born in Canada, Stastny is a dual {{citizen of}} Canada and the United States. Both {{he and his}} brother Yan have chosen to play {{international}}ly for the United States. Among the reasons that led him to choose to play for the United States <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> to play in an international competition with his brother, who had chosen to play for the United States before Paul. Paul represented the U.S. {{for the first time in}} the 2004 Viking Cup, where he won a silver medal playing for the junior team. According to Hockey's Future, he was one of the most important American talents in the tournament. Stastny played internationally for the United States national ice hockey team for the first time in the 2007 IIHF World Championship. He played seven games, scored four goals and four assists, had two penalty minutes and finished even in plus/minus. The United States lost in the quarterfinals against Finland. Stastny was named the best American player in the 3–0 win against Germany, when he scored two goals and had one assist. He was chosen as one of the three best United States players at the tournament, together with Lee Stempniak and Toby Petersen.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{story was}} born from wanting to expand upon the {{original}} game's {{theme of the}} growing rift between mankind and the gods. The Greek Underworld was the one major mythical location that the developers of Titan Quest had not yet approached. As it offered {{a rich source of}} material for their creative staff, it was made the location for the expansion. The story concept the team began with <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a secondary hostile force besides the Titans that had only kept away from humans due to the presence of the Olympians, and now rose up as they retreated from human affairs. With the quests, the team worked to improve on the structure and impact they had in the original, introducing famous places and people from history and mythology. They also expanded the variety of side quests, and included elements such as legends and customs related to the dead. The script was written by Dean O'Donnell. While an experienced playwright, he encountered new challenges in writing for the video game medium, as he needed to always assume that the player had spoken first to a selected NPC and to contain the necessary information in the first line of dialogue with embellishment in additional lines. Aesthetically, the tone of Immortal Throne was darker than that of its predecessor, with one of the main elements of this change being the cover art: according to designer Arthur Bruno, this was in reaction to the unfavorable impression players received from the surface appearance of Titan Quest when compared to the darker take on Grecian mythology in the God of War series.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the loss}} to Miami knocked the Hokies out of {{contention}} for the Big East championship and its accompanying automatic BCS bid, there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that Tech could receive an at-large BCS game bid if it scored high enough in the final BCS poll and the administrators of a BCS game wanted to invite the Hokies. Tech was considered a long shot due to the availability of Oregon State and Notre Dame, two teams with large followings that would attract greater television revenue and ticket sales. Gator Bowl officials made plans based on different possibilities. If Virginia Tech was selected for a BCS bowl but Notre Dame was not, the Fighting Irish would play in the Gator Bowl. If both were selected, Big East No. 3 Pittsburgh would be given the nod for the Gator Bowl. On December 3, the BCS selections were announced: The Fiesta Bowl selected No. 5 Oregon State and No. 10 Notre Dame instead of No. 6 Virginia Tech. This left the Hokies available for the Gator Bowl, which picked them on the next day.|$|E
