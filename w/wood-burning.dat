5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, <b>wood-burning</b> stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|The Fitchburg Railroad {{main line}} opened on an east-west {{alignment}} through the tiny village of South Groton in Groton, Massachusetts in December 1845. Following a town vote the previous year, Groton station was established at Flannigan's Crossing (Groton-Harvard Road). The station was {{located on the}} southwest corner of the grade crossing, with a freight house just to its west and a woodshed (to supply early <b>wood-burning</b> locomotives) across the tracks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) plans a woodshop {{expansion}} {{in his home}} and seeks the approval of city planner Mark (Paul Schneider). Mark informs Ron that an inspection is needed {{to ensure that the}} facility meets all current zoning code standards, and an obviously lying Ron claims it does, clearly underscoring his vexation with governmental regulations. During the inspection, Mark finds numerous code violations, including oily rags placed above a <b>wood-burning</b> fireplace and a long-outdated fire extinguisher. Later, Mark takes a half-day off so that he can help his friend's woodshop meet city code. Ron thanks Mark by building a wooden canoe and leaving it in his office.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one cabins {{can be used}} by {{visitors}} at Black Moshannon State Park. Thirteen are rustic cabins, built by the CCC, with electric lights, a kitchen stove and a <b>wood-burning</b> stove, refrigerator, and bunk beds. Six are modern cabins, including the former ski lodge, with electric heat, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bath. There are also two deluxe camping cottages with electric heat and similar amenities as the rustic cabins. All cabin renters need to bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. Pets are prohibited in all cabins in the park.|$|E
5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations {{it may be the}} only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield in the search for fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern <b>wood-burning</b> stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E
5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognji≈°te {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a <b>wood-burning</b> kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E
5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight smokestack (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular headlamp, and a small cowcatcher. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an observation coach. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond smokestack (typical of <b>wood-burning</b> locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a caboose. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of cast iron <b>wood-burning</b> parlor stoves, the Amish only accept the product in black, so Lehman's {{arranges}} special manufacturer runs, typically buying a three-year supply at a time.|$|E
25|$|PAHs are {{typically}} found as complex mixtures. Lower-temperature combustion, such as tobacco smoking or <b>wood-burning,</b> tends to generate {{low molecular weight}} PAHs, whereas high-temperature industrial processes typically generate PAHs with higher molecular weights.|$|E
25|$|Odisha has {{a culinary}} {{tradition}} spanning centuries if not millennia. The kitchen {{of the famous}} Jagannath temple in Puri is reputed {{to be the largest}} in the world, with a thousand cooks, working around 752 <b>wood-burning</b> clay hearths called chulas, to feed over 10,000 people everyday.|$|E
25|$|One {{successful}} {{accomplishment of}} Barron {{and his allies}} was preventing the construction {{by the city of}} a <b>wood-burning</b> incinerator in the neighborhood. In 1996, Barron and community groups also fought the building of a natural gas generator. Barron said his opposition to the incinerator is what catapulted him into electoral politics.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} the {{transition}} from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her hair with a bright red bow. Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a <b>wood-burning</b> stove and flying her mother's old broom.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{interior}} {{consisted of two}} classrooms and a coatroom. In the 1940s the external outhouses were replaced with the installation of internal plumbing and two restrooms. The classrooms are divided by a sliding wooden partition. The original <b>wood-burning</b> stoves used to heat the structure have since been replaced by central heating. Neither the architect or builder is known.|$|E
25|$|For {{those who}} prefer to enjoy nature {{from the comfort of}} a chair, the city's public library is nestled in a serene and scenic {{location}} at the edge of Old Mill Park where visitors may relax indoors near the <b>wood-burning</b> fireplace and view the redwood forest through the library's multi-storied windows, or from the outside deck which overlooks the park and Cascade Creek.|$|E
25|$|Belize has {{considerable}} {{potential for}} hydroelectric and other renewable energy resources, such as solar and biomass. In the mid-1980s a Belizean businessman proposed {{the construction of}} a <b>wood-burning</b> power station for the production of electricity, but the idea foundered in the wake of ecological concerns and economic constraints. In late 2005, a company named Belize Natural Energy found oil in commercial quantities in the Spanish Lookout area of Belize.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} schools in Eagar, {{dating back to}} the 1890s. A new {{building}} was built in 1927, however while school was in session on Friday, January 10, 1930, the building caught fire from a spark from one of the <b>wood-burning</b> stoves used for heat. Within 30 minutes, the building burned to the ground, with no loss of life. It was after this disaster that the building currently known as Eagar school was constructed.|$|E
25|$|Besides mining {{anthracite}} coal, Pittston {{was home}} to many industries in the 19th and 20th centuries, including metals, plastics, paper products, apparel, electrical equipment and beverages. The Pittston Stove Company, established in 1864, manufactured coal and <b>wood-burning</b> stoves for heating and cooking. The Pittston Brewing Company, brewers of Glennon's Beer, maintained operations in Pittston from 1873 until 1948. Evan R. Jones Stoneware crafted pottery which bore the Pittston name in the 1870s and 1880s.|$|E
25|$|Between 2002 and 2004, 73% {{of heating}} fires and 27% of all {{residential}} {{fires in the}} United States {{were found to be}} caused by failure to clean out creosote buildup. Since 1990, creosote buildup has caused 75% fewer fires. This is partly due to the use of efficient <b>wood-burning</b> stoves that fully combust the carbon from fuel, and partly due to the use of Class A flues, insulated double wall stainless steel pipe.|$|E
25|$|Tongans {{no longer}} make an earth oven every day. Most daily cooking is done by women, who cook in {{battered}} pots over open fires in the village, in <b>wood-burning</b> stoves in some households, and on gas or electric ranges {{in some of the}} larger towns. The meal schedule has also changed, to more Westernized breakfast, light lunch, and heavy dinner. Tongans say that the old schedule is unworkable when household members have Western-style jobs, or attend schools at some distance from home; such family members cannot come home to eat, then have a doze after a heavy mid-day meal.|$|E
25|$|The organic farm at Green Gulch {{supplies}} local {{restaurants and}} food suppliers and sells flowers, produce and herbs at Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco. Guests {{stay at the}} Lindisfarne Guest House, a traditional Japanese building with a <b>wood-burning</b> stove as the heating source. Zen practice {{is not required to}} stay at Green Gulch, though guests are welcome to participate in zazen or any other activities. Tenshin Reb Anderson-roshi, former abbot of City Zen Center, is senior Dharma teacher at Green Gulch‚Äî‚Äîtraining priests and laypeople, leading sesshins, giving talks and conducting workshops while also living onsite.|$|E
25|$|Shi Yan Ming {{was born}} Duan Gen Shan in Zhumadian in Henan Province, China, on Chinese New Year's, February 13, 1964, {{the year of}} the Dragon, the seventh of nine children. His father grew up in a family so poor that they were {{essentially}} homeless, and begged for food door to door. Duan's father, who never went to school, slept under a <b>wood-burning</b> stove, or would dig a hole in a stack of wheat for warmth. Despite these hardships, he taught himself to be a very literate reader, writer and calligrapher. Duan's mother's family was slightly better off financially. As was typical, she was not educated either, had her feet bound, and was raised solely to be a mother and housewife. Duan's parents eventually acquired jobs for the Chinese government under Mao, and worked underground as telex operators.|$|E
25|$|With frame {{buildings}} and <b>wood-burning</b> fireplaces and stoves, fire {{was always a}} risk in the city. Chimney fires were frequent. On March 18, 1741, the governor's house in Fort George caught on fire, and soon the church connected to his house was ablaze too. People tried to save it, but the fire soon grew beyond control. The fire threatened to spread to another building, where all the city documents were kept. The governor ordered the windows smashed and documents thrown out to save them. Later the practice was {{to keep them in}} the City Hall. A week later another fire broke out, but was put out quickly. The same thing happened the next week at a warehouse. Three days later a fire broke out in a cow stable. On the next day a person walking past a wealthy neighborhood saw coals by the hay in a stable and put them out, saving the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church {{has a strong}} verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in <b>wood-burning</b> kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.|$|E
500|$|Tulsa has two static {{displays}} of old steam railroad locomotives for free public viewing: [...] the 1917 <b>wood-burning</b> Dierks Forest 207, a 2-6-2 Prairie-type {{located at the}} Tulsa State Fairgrounds; and, the 1942 oil-burning Frisco Meteor 4500, a Baldwin 4-8-4 Northern-type at the Route 66 Historical Village.|$|E
500|$|The housing {{developed}} by the Crest Nicholson/BioRegional Quintain joint venture is intended to encourage environmentally friendly, sustainable lifestyles, based on lessons learnt from the award-winning BedZED development in Wallington, south London. This was {{developed by}} the Peabody Trust in partnership with BioRegional Development Group. Proposals include [...] "green lifestyle" [...] packs and information for residents, solar panels, a communal <b>wood-burning</b> boiler to heat the apartments and provide hot water, solar-powered recharging point for electric cars, roof-mounted wind turbines, a community allotment/garden irrigated by rainwater from the roof, a car club, and a high proportion of recycled materials used in construction.|$|E
500|$|The oldest bell in {{the tower}} dates from 1698 and was cast by the Bilbie family who were bell founders and clockmakers based {{initially}} in the village. The Bilbie family produced more than 1,350 bells, which are hung in churches all over the West Country. Supplies of the tin and copper used to make bell metal were probably obtained from brass foundries in Kelston and Bristol. The metal was melted in a <b>wood-burning</b> furnace to over [...] and then poured into a mould made from loam, or foundry mud, from the River Chew. Others in St Andrew's are from the same maker are dated 1718 and 1731. The bells were tuned and re-hung into a new frame in 1908 and again in 1996 with a new bell from John Taylor's foundry in Loughborough replacing the treble. The redundant bell is now {{on display at the}} back of the church as a memorial to the Bilbies.|$|E
500|$|Just {{seven years}} after Robert Fulton proved the {{commercial}} viability of steam-powered ships with his North River Steamboat (more commonly known today as Clermont) in 1807, small <b>wood-burning</b> steamers began to ply the Chesapeake Bay. Before the arrival of railroads and river steamboats in the early 19th century, overland travel was exceedingly slow and tedious. Rivers were the main means of transportation and most cities were founded on them. This was especially so in North America, where journeys over vast distances of hundreds or even thousands of miles required months of hazardous, uncomfortable travel by stagecoach or wagon on rutted, unpaved trails. In the 1830s, railroads were being built, but the technology was crude and average passenger train speed was only [...] Perhaps more importantly, most early railroads did not connect. [...] It would be many years before the various lines were knitted together to make intercity rail travel in the U.S. a reality. Not until 1863, for example, was it possible to travel between New York City and Washington, D. C., without changing trains en route.|$|E
500|$|Not all of Peale's {{innovations}} were successful. [...] He {{caused the}} Mint {{to purchase a}} large lathe for turning heavy metal rolls, which cost the government at least $2,000 and that Peale conceded had never worked and likely never would. He bought from his nephew, George Sellers, a set of molds for casting ingots and accompanying equipment, which proved unusable as they were not adapted to the Mint's machinery. [...] A drawbench made by Peale {{at the cost of}} at least $1,500 proved dangerous as the piston would drive with tremendous force against the end of its cylinder, causing a concussion and endangering those nearby. [...] "Peale's machine gun" [...] was put aside by Mint staff as useless soon after its introduction. An 1853 attempt by Peale to convert the Philadelphia Mint's <b>wood-burning</b> annealing furnaces to use anthracite coal destroyed the furnaces, cost the government several thousand dollars, and led to Peale being ordered to undertake no more such projects. One invention that worked well was the [...] "noisy sofa"‚Äîsitting on it set off a trumpet blast. [...] Constructed at the cost of about $200 in government funds, it graced in turn the offices of Peale and Patterson.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>wood-burning</b> stove department, {{which was}} the most heavily damaged by the flood, {{was the last to}} reopen. [...] It did so on April 9, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} floor, the cabin has three rooms. [...] There {{is a central}} living room, a kitchen, and a small bedroom. [...] The upstairs is a bunkroom that {{provides}} additional sleeping quarters. [...] The cabin has two wooden platform beds and four bunk bed sets; however, there are no mattresses. [...] The cabin is also furnished with table and chairs. [...] In the living room, there is a <b>wood-burning</b> stove for heat. [...] In the kitchen, there is a <b>wood-burning</b> cook stove. The cabin does not have electricity or water.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} types of stoves such as the kitchen stove {{which is used to}} cook food, and the <b>wood-burning</b> stove or a coal stove which is {{typically}} used for heating a dwelling.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans {{introduced}} an oven called a [...] "furn" [...] ("purni" [...] in Talmudic Aramaic), a large, <b>wood-burning,</b> stone-lined oven with a bottom {{on which the}} dough or baking sheet was placed. This provided a major advance in bread and pastry baking, and made the baking of much thicker loaves possible.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the primary}} goal of carbon offsets is to reduce global carbon emissions, many offset {{projects}} also claim to lead to improvements in {{the quality of life for}} a local population. These additional improvements are termed co-benefits, and may be considered when evaluating and comparing carbon offset projects. Some possible co-benefits from a project that replaces <b>wood-burning</b> stoves with ovens using a less carbon-intensive fuel include: ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{air-tight}} stove is a <b>wood-burning</b> stove {{designed to}} burn solid fuel, traditionally wood, {{in a controlled}} fashion so as to provide for efficient and controlled fuel use, {{and the benefits of}} stable heating or cooking temperatures. [...] They are made of sheet metal, consisting of a drum-like combustion chamber with airflow openings that can be open and shut, and a chimney of a metre or more length.|$|E
