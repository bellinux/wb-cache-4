5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an emergency system of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion.

On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E

This <b>was</b> <b>roughly</b> constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp.
