40|$|The Site Generated Radiological Waste Handling System handles {{radioactive}} waste {{products that are}} generated at the geologic repository operations area. The waste is collected, treated if required, packaged for shipment, and shipped to a disposal site. Waste streams include low-level waste (LLW) in solid and liquid forms, as-well-as mixed waste that contains hazardous and radioactive constituents. Liquid LLW is segregated into two streams, non-recyclable and recyclable. The non-recyclable stream may contain detergents or other non-hazardous cleaning agents and is packaged for shipment. The recyclable stream is treated to recycle {{a large portion of}} the water while the remaining concentrated waste is packaged for shipment; this greatly reduces the volume of waste requiring disposal. There will be no liquid LLW discharge. Solid LLW consists of wet solids such as ion exchange resins and filter cartridges, as-well-as dry active waste such as tools, protective clothing, and poly bags. Solids will be sorted, volume reduced, and packaged for shipment. The generation of mixed waste at the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) is not planned; however, if it does come into existence, it will be collected and packaged for disposal at its point of occurrence, temporarily staged, then shipped to government-approved off-site facilities for disposal. The Site Generated Radiological Waste Handling System has equipment located in both the Waste Treatment Building (WTB) and in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). All types of liquid and solid LLW are processed in the WTB, while <b>wet</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> from the Pool Water Treatment and Cooling System is packaged where received in the WHB. There is no installed hardware for mixed waste. The Site Generated Radiological Waste Handling System receives waste from locations where water is used for decontamination functions. In most cases the water is piped back to the WTB for processing. The WTB and WHB provide staging areas for storing and shipping LLW packages as well as any mixed waste packages. The buildings house the system and provide shielding and support for the components. The system is ventilated by and connects to the ventilation systems in the buildings to prevent buildup and confine airborne radioactivity via the high efficiency particulate air filters.

40|$|Solid {{waste is}} the most {{critical}} and visible pollution stream in Sri Lanka. As many developing countries urban solid waste in Sri Lanka consists with high organic and <b>wet</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b> Studies on solid waste show that about 81 % of the total waste consists of organic solid waste. Organic waste can be composted {{and it is clear}} if organic waste issue is addressed the major part of the sold waste component will be automatically addressed. Above statistics show that the major component of any sustainable solid waste management plan should be organic waste treatment. However in Sri Lanka composting is not a popular option for solid waste. There are many reasons behind it. Some of them are long lead compo sting time, low quality of the final product, mixed solid waste, lack of funds, technical problems in composting, less availability of expertise, etc. Under this background there is a need of sustainable composting system which is suitable for high organic urban solid waste while answering the drawbacks of the present composting systems. This research aims to answer that timely and growing problem. Since composting is happened as a result of microbiological activities, by optimizing them factors for microbiological activities composting process can be optimized. This is the fundamental argument in this research. BIOCOM-MSW composting system(the method which IS introduced by this research) consists of relevant equipment for semi automation system, with a major component of drum reactor. The strategies are used to maintain a high compo sting process are controlling C:N ratio, moisture content, particle size, rotating speed and rotating time. It is aimed to maintain the thermophilic stage of the composting throughout the composting process. Final outcome of the research shows through this new attempt, after three days it is possible to obtain a stable product from organic solid waste. It can be identified that the waste has gone through a rapid stabilization. Result of this research shows that it can be introduced in two major practical implementations. They are as follows; 1. Rapid organic waste stabilization 2. Rapid pretreatment in sanitary land filling instead of biological pretreatment In present back ground, export and local market consist with an increasing demand for organic foods, especially for fruits, vegetables and tea. According to that there IS an increasing demand for organic fertilizers. It is a timely need of the country to identify a solution for organic solid waste not only in the point of environment and health but also in {{the point of view of}} economic and agricultural sector development.

Objective: The present study aimed to survey qualitative and quantitative analysis of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> in Shiraz city and comparative these results with the world scenario of <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> generation for improving the sustainable management of <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b> Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 in nine municipality regions Shiraz with a total population of approximately 1, 549, 354 people. Basic data was gathered through Shiraz waste management organization. Then generation (per capita) and constituent percent of the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> were evaluated based on the sampling and field analyzing from reliable guidelines. Data were analyzed with Stata- 13 and Excel statistical software. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test used for the normality of variables. Means were compared by Student T test and Mann-Whitney test.

40|$|This study {{involved}} a torrefaction (mild pyrolysis) processing approach {{that could be}} used to sterilize feces and produce a stable, odor-free solid product that can be stored or recycled, and also to simultaneously recover moisture. It was demonstrated that mild heating (200 - 250 C) in nitrogen or air was adequate for torrefaction of a fecal simulant and an analog of human <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> (canine feces). The net result was a nearly undetectable odor (for the canine feces), complete recovery of moisture, some additional water production, a modest reduction of the dry solid mass, and the production of small amounts of gas and liquid. The liquid product is mainly water, with a small Total Organic Carbon content. The amount of solid vs gas plus liquid products can be controlled by adjusting the torrefaction conditions (final temperature, holding time), and the current work has shown that the benefits of torrefaction could be achieved in a low temperature range (< 250 C). These temperatures are compatible with the PTFE bag materials historically used by NASA for fecal waste containment and will reduce the energy consumption of the process. The solid product was a dry material that did not support bacterial growth and was hydrophobic relative to the starting material. In the case of canine feces, the solid product was a mechanically friable material that could be easily compacted to a significantly smaller volume (approx. 50 %). The proposed Torrefaction Processing Unit (TPU) would be designed to be compatible with the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS), now under development by NASA. A stand-alone TPU could be used to treat the canister from the UWMS, along with other types of <b>wet</b> <b>solid</b> <b>wastes,</b> with either conventional or microwave heating. Over time, a more complete integration of the TPU and the UWMS could be achieved, but will require design changes in both units...|$|R

The replacement looked into in this paper is an algae pond with <b>wet</b> organic <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> (WOSW) in combination with an anaerobic digester (AD). The main focus of the algae type {{and the type of}} WOSW were Chlorella Vulgaris and wheat straw respectively. It was developed a chemical oxygen demand (COD) balance in Microsoft Excel to investigate the theoretical production of biogas. The two cases that were tested were the case with algae pond and WOSW and a case with algae pond and silage. The pond was investigated for surface areas of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 m 2. It was shown that theoretically the increase of biogas is 0. 1 m 3 CH 4 gas per day when you increase the pond size by 10 m 2. In the silage case it was investigated on how much mass that was needed to produce twice the volume of biogas from the AD. The same mass that was found in the silage case was then used in different ways to investigate the WOSW. In both cases the production of biogas will increase. How much the biogas will increase depends {{on the size of the}} farm and the space available to build the pond. Connecting WOSW and algae pond to an AD looks like a promising way to increase the biogas production. It should be look into in more detail and with experiments...|$|R

The City of Johannesburg {{is facing}} the {{simultaneous}} challenges of an increased generation of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> in the City, unemployment and the running out of land to dispose the <b>waste.</b> Of the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> that is generated, 50 % is recyclable while only 10 % is recycled (SOER, 2003 : 69). <b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling is mainly performed through private sector initiatives in the City of Johannesburg. Consequently, there is no proper coordination with government initiatives. In order for South Africa to increase and sustain economic growth that would decrease unemployment, {{there should be a}} culture of entrepreneurship (Mass, G & Herrington M, 2006 : 7). <b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> buy-back centres assist in addressing the challenges of dealing with the increased generation of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> and the scarcity of land for disposal. These centres also reduce the challenges of unemployment through promoting entrepreneurs to operate <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling businesses. Developed economies have managed to increase the rate of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling to 60 %. The problems associated with <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> have been reduced by promoting recycling through a combination of legislation and setting-up of agencies to deal with <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. South Africa has legislation and stated programmes to deal with <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. Nevertheless, there has been complexity with implementing recycling. This {{is the result of a}} lack of co-ordination between the role-players involved in the value chain of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. In order for the City of Johannesburg to increase the recycling of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> from 10 % to optimal rates of between 50 % and 60 %, there should be co-ordination of programmes amongst all the role players. In addition, there should also be skills provision to existing and potential entrepreneurs operating the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> buy-back centres. All spheres of government should promote <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling business to potential entrepreneurs and the public in order to recycle 40 % of the recyclable <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> that is not being recycled. The establishment of a <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> buy-back centre in the City of Johannesburg is economically viable with some buy-back centre realising a net-profit of least R 5 000 and some more than R 30 000 per month. In order for the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> buy-back centre to realise a net-profit of more than R 30 000 per month, there must be more than 40 tons of recyclable <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> received by the buy-back centre per month.

Such rise in <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> generation is observed in Brihanmumbai, Thane, Mira-Bhayandar, Kalyan-Dombivali, Ulhasnagar, Navi-Mumbai and Bhiwand-Nizampur Municipal Corporation. An increase in <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> is observed because {{of increase in}} urbanization, population density and income, changing food habits, taste and pattern. The growth of industry, commercial units such as hotels, theaters, restaurants, malls are rising fast. Such units are positively contributing to the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> generation. <b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> collection, segregation and disposal capacity of Municipal Corporations is low and inadequate with rising <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b> Therefore municipal corporations must adopt scientific methods for collection, segregation and disposal of <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b> Municipal corporations must accommodate private sector for investment and management of <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b> Urgent steps in this direction will reduce the water, air, soil pollutions and health hazards. It will improve the quality life of people in Mumbai Metropolitan Region. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ‚Äî <b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> {{management}} {{issues are}} increasing in developing world due {{to increase in}} population every year. Open dumping and irregular collections of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> are creating serious environmental threats in small towns of developing world. In Pakistan, poor <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management practices, lack of funds and irresponsible behavior of dwellers are reflecting the worst scenario in the country. To emphasize the major <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management issues in the small towns of developing world, Taxila city is selected as a case study. Taxila city is facing the worst <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management issues due to rapid urbanization, industrialization, insufficient funds and poor management. Open dumps of municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> are causing serious negative environmental impacts in the study area. Research findings are clearly indicating that due to rapid growth in population, increments in <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> generation rate, poor management, non-implementation of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> legislation and lack of funding {{are responsible for the}} <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management crises in the Taxila city. Faulty <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management system is creating negative environmental impacts like land and water pollution, infectious diseases, blockage of open drain and small canals and loss of biodiversity in Taxila city.

The population growth, changing consumption patterns, and rapid urbanization {{contribute significantly to}} the growing volumes of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> that are generated in urban settings. As the rate of urbanization increases, demand on the services of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management increases. The rapid urban growth in Langkawi Island, Malaysia, combined with the increasing rates of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> production has provided evidence that the traditional <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management practices, particularly the methods of waste collection and disposal, are inefficient and quite nonsustainable. Accordingly, municipal managers and planners in Langkawi need to look for and adopt a model for <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management that emphasizes an efficient and sustainable management of <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> in Langkawi Island. This study presents the current practices of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management in Langkawi Island, describes {{the composition of the}} <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> generated in that area, and presents views of local residents and tourist on issues related to <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management like the aesthetic value of the island environment. The most important issue of this paper is that {{it is the first time}} that integrated <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management is investigated in the Langkawi Island. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> {{has become}} a {{critical}} issue with rising population, urbanization, economic activities and consumerism, especially in urban centers creating {{a negative impact on}} environment due to inappropriate handling of municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste.</b> Further, social, economical and health issues such as unpleasant odor, ground water contamination, epidemics and social effects also are being created due to land filling. Lack of physical, human and financial resources, poor participation and less enthusiasm among community groups and government representatives overloaded with additional work none related to <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> activities are significant challenges. Equally, literature revealed that existing SWM systems established within most local authorities are not properly operated and maintained in Sri Lanka. Hence, significant gaps are visible in <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management activities at local authorities. Thus, this research intends to explore municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management systems in Sri Lanka to identify best practices. Case study research approach was used and multiple cases were selected representing both best and worst practices in municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management. Data were gathered through semi structured interviews. An outcome of the study is a framework developed for best practices of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management which can be used at local authorities for effective and efficient municipal <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> management.
