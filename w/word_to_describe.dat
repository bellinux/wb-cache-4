25|$|Empty cells do not {{necessarily}} imply that a particular language is lacking a <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language may be formed from another stem {{and is not a}} cognate with the other words in the row or that a loanword is used in its place.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{language of}} Iceland is Icelandic, a highly inflected North Germanic language. Danish and English are also taught in schools. Linguistic purism is strongly supported in Iceland {{in an attempt}} to prevent loanwords from entering the language. Instead, neologisms are coined from Icelandic roots, creating a compound <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> new concepts. It is often the case that old words which are no longer used are recycled with a new meaning. It should be noted, however, that some loanwords persist in Icelandic, and many more, the majority anglicisms, are used in everyday speech.|$|E

25|$|Goncharov's first novel, A Common Story, was {{published}} in Sovremennik in 1847. It dealt with {{the conflict between the}} excessive romanticism of a young Russian nobleman who has recently arrived in Saint Petersburg from the provinces, and the sober pragmatism of the emerging commercial class of the capital. A Common Story polarized critics and made its author famous. The novel was a direct response to Vissarion Belinsky's call for exposing a new type, that of the complacent romantic, common at the time; it was lavishly praised by the famous critic {{as one of the best}} Russian books of the year. The term aduyevschina (after the novel's protagonist Aduyev) became popular with reviewers who saw it as synonymous with vain romantic aspirations. Leo Tolstoy, who liked the novel, used the same <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> social egotism and the inability of some people to see beyond their immediate interests.|$|E
500|$|Another HouseGuest, Braden, {{made several}} racist and {{derogatory}} comments {{after the first}} Power of Veto ceremony to fellow HouseGuests Kevin and Lydia in an argument. The argument was edited during the first live eviction show on Thursday but played unedited on the live feeds. During the live portion of the show, Chima brought up the comments made by Braden again during her final plea speech to her fellow HouseGuests. Chima also stated Braden used a sexually insulting <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> Big Brother host Julie Chen. [...] This comment was made {{at the conclusion of}} a [...] "Julie Says" [...] game played by the HouseGuests a couple nights earlier as viewed on Big Brother After Dark.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{also took}} place in Manali and Film City in Mumbai. During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik {{described}} the incident as a [...] "freak accident", stating, [...] "I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do I say? I guess the right <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the situation would be jadoo (magic)." [...] Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the first}} use of the <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> music was in rock critic John Mendelsohn's scathing review of the first Stooges album {{published}} December 7, 1969 in the Los Angeles Times. He dismissed most of the songs on it as [...] "whiny, adolescently repulsive and barely distinguishable street-punk anthems." [...] The first known use of the phrase punk rock appeared in the Chicago Tribune on March 22, 1970, attributed to Ed Sanders, cofounder of New York's anarcho-prankster band the Fugs. Sanders was quoted describing a solo album of his as [...] "punk rock—redneck sentimentality". In the December 1970 issue of Creem, Lester Bangs, mocking more mainstream rock musicians, ironically referred to Iggy Pop as [...] "that Stooge punk". Suicide's Alan Vega credits this usage with inspiring his duo to bill its gigs as a [...] "punk mass" [...] {{for the next couple}} of years.|$|E
500|$|Birttany Spanos {{from the}} Rolling Stone called the video [...] "trippy", commenting that it's as [...] "inventive as her album Broke With Expensive Taste". Billboards Lars Brandle also {{provided}} a favorable review for the video, commenting [...] "you've never seen anything quite like it". According to Corban Goble of Pitchfork Media, it's not a [...] "typical music video", because [...] "the technology inserts your image into the video, like you're looking in a mirror". Taylor Weatherby from Entertainment Weekly wrote that there's only one <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the video and it's [...] "trippy". In July 2015, Paper ranked the music video for [...] "Wallace" [...] {{as one of the}} most underrated videos from 2014. Amidst controversy between Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift, concerning the fairness of the MTV Video Music Awards, Tshepo Mokoena from The Guardian claimed that if the process was truly based on quality, Banks' video for [...] "Wallace" [...] would have been nominated.|$|E
500|$|A UGO Networks {{columnist}} {{was concerned}} that the expensive pilot {{would be hard to}} translate into weekly episodes, but [...] "after sitting down to watch Fringes second episode, [...] "The Same Old Story", my concerns have vanished. Fringes second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of Fringes eleven-herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X-Files is even better defined in the first weekly-episode. I'd struggled to find the <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> it, and the winner is 'condensed'. [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more combustible space." [...] Another UGO writer, Alex Zalben, later compared [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Død Kalm". Zalben concluded that [...] "Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children. [...] In so doing, Nellie fails {{to live up to}} the American ideal that [...] "all men are created equal", which Emile had earlier affirmed. This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, {{initially}} unable to force out a <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word [...] "Polynesian", responds with [...] "colored". [...] This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production. [...] As Frank Rich of The New York Times commented, [...] "it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype– she's lovable... But how can we love a racist?" [...] Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor– Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, as she puts it, [...] "French planters stingy bastards!" ...|$|E
500|$|Literary scholar Karl Kroeber (1926–2009) {{argues that}} Lucy [...] "possesses a double existence; her actual, {{historical}} existence and her idealised {{existence in the}} poet's mind. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant only insofar as it makes manifest the significance implicit in the actual girl." [...] Hartman holds the same view; to him Lucy is seen [...] "entirely from within the poet, so that this modality may be the poet's own", but then he argues, [...] "she belongs to the category of spirits who must still become human... the poet describes her as dying at {{a point at which}} she would have been humanized." [...] The literary historian Kenneth Johnston concludes that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth's muse, and the group as a whole [...] "is a series of invocations to a Muse feared dead. As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> them, but breathlessly, almost aware of what such a loss would mean to the speaker: 'oh, the difference to me!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Romney held {{a series}} of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public {{services}} professionals and community activists who attended. [...] He opened his office in the Michigan State Capitol to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted to speak with him on Thursday mornings, and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol. [...] He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath. [...] His blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction, and family members and associates used the idiom [...] "bull in a china shop" [...] to describe him. [...] He took a theatrical approach to governance, staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome. One former aide later said that willful was too weak a <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> him, and chose messianic instead. [...] Romney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones; writer Theodore H. White said [...] "the first quality that surfaced, as one met and talked with George Romney over a number of years, was a sincerity so profound that, in conversation, one was almost embarrassed." ...|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Richard Erlich {{wrote in}} 2006 that the {{depiction}} of the religious cult of Bliss was influenced by Le Guin's interest in Taoist thought, and an example of Le Guin's critique of Christianity. The angels use of the phrase [...] "the planetary hypothesis" [...] to refer to their terrestrial origin was a gentle dig at Christian fundamentalism in the United States, with its insistence that evolution is [...] "merely a theory." [...] The story also refers {{to the success of}} Christian fundamentalists in taking over school boards in the US. A more direct criticism of Christianity comes in Le Guin's depiction of the cult of Bliss being disrespectful of women, as well as of believing in a nuclear, patriarchal family. Bliss is portrayed as a closed system; members reinforce manipulate the ship's data banks to remove references to Earth and their destination, because they value stability {{even to the point of}} denying some of their own knowledge. A reference to Christianity is also present in Le Guin's <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> activity outside the ship: the real-world term [...] "extravehicular activity" [...] or EVA is used as a single word [...] "Eva," [...] in reference to the biblical [...] "Eve": angels in the story see going outside the ship as an act of transgression associated with death.|$|E
500|$|In November 1988, Guns N' Roses {{released}} the stopgap album G N' R Lies, which {{sold more than}} five million copies in the U.S. alone. The band – and Rose in particular – were accused of promoting racist and homophobic attitudes with the song [...] "One in a Million", in which Rose warns [...] "niggers" [...] to [...] "get out of my way" [...] and complains about [...] "faggots" [...] who [...] "spread some fucking disease". During the controversy, Rose defended {{his use of the}} racial slur by claiming that [...] "it's a <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn't necessarily mean black." [...] In 1992, however, he conceded that he had used the word as an insult towards black people, stating, [...] "I was pissed off about some black people that were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult those particular black people. I didn't want to support racism." [...] In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself [...] "pro-heterosexual" [...] and blamed this attitude on [...] "bad experiences" [...] with gay men, citing an attempted rape in his late teens and the alleged molestation by his biological father. The controversy led to Guns N' Roses being dropped from the roster of an AIDS benefit show in New York organized by the Gay Men's Health Crisis.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} criticized for its {{graphics}} and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing {{is limited by the}} creaking engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' may be a better <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called [...] "outrageously bad." ...|$|E
