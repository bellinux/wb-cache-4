"If {{you want}} to make any remarks about this story, papa," [...] said the Daughter of the House, [...] "which shall be worth anything, you ought to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> more of it and begin to {{understand}} it. When Miss Amanda found she had a very little while to live, she composed herself comfortably, and began to repeat to herself the words, 'Fifty years, fifty years, fifty years,' over and over again.

When we move it must be as a mighty torrent to overwhelm the invaders. Not Camalodunum only, but every Roman town must be laid in ruins.

6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} way," [...] said he at last, [...] "though even in {{it there}} is danger. The woods are safer than the river, for the reeds are full of cached canoes. Five leagues from here is the {{blockhouse}} of Poitou, and fifteen miles beyond, that of Auvergne. We will go to-morrow to Poitou through the woods and see if all be safe. I will go with you, and I give you my word that if the Iroquois are there, Greysolon du Lhut will know it. The lady we shall leave here, and if we find that all is safe we shall come back for her.

6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] he said, [...] "we are only strangers from the {{personal}} point of view, which is possibly an advantage.

5000|$|On Classical Music Sentinel in 2011, Jean-Yves Duperron wrote, [...] "This great {{collaborative}} recording {{from the}} 1970s deserves {{the term of}} Definitive Recording simply for being what it is. A very successful coming together of different genres of music that created an impact, that is still being felt today.... If you like blues music, Leonard Bernstein's Mass, even something a bit more remote like the Sketches of Spain by Miles Davis, you will love these pieces blending the upbeat sound of a blues band with a symphony orchestra. And if you love {{the sound of a}} well-played blues harmonica, just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> what Corky Siegel can achieve on that versatile instrument.

'Into The Deep' (or as I have retitled it: 'Slow Story In A Burning Room') is a string of convenient plot twists stemming from the Sleeping Curse that Snow White, Aurora, and Henry have all fallen under in the past, and it uses the curse to progress the plot in a passive fashion. Last episode’s cliffhanger revealed that Aurora can talk to Henry inside the netherworld of their dreams, and this week, that burning room becomes a magical telephone that allows the two worlds to communicate with each other.
