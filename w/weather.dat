5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler <b>weather</b> radars operated by the National <b>Weather</b> Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced <b>Weather</b> Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of <b>weather,</b> satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term <b>weather</b> forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous <b>Weather</b> Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans <b>weather</b> forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter <b>weather</b> and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring <b>weather</b> balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA <b>weather</b> radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe <b>Weather</b> NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe <b>weather</b> operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe <b>weather</b> outbreaks, coordinating information between <b>weather</b> spotters and forecasters.|$|E

50|$|Spheroidal <b>weathering</b> {{is a form}} of {{chemical}} <b>weathering</b> that affects jointed bedrock and results in the formation of concentric or spherical layers of highly decayed rock within <b>weathered</b> bedrock that is known as saprolite. When saprolite is exposed by physical erosion, these concentric layers peel (spall) off as concentric shells much like the layers of a peeled onion.

Powdered basalt rock was <b>weathered</b> using solutions with pH of 4. 5, 5. 5, and 7. 0 under two conditions: continuous and alternate wetting and drying. Effects of solutions and <b>weathering</b> conditions on rate of <b>weathering</b> were analyzed. Results indicated that <b>weathering</b> rates for Mg, Na, and K (mobile ions) declined over time and approached a relatively stable rate that was not greatly affected by pH differences. <b>Weathering</b> with alternate wetting and drying showed more cumulative ion removal than continuous <b>weathering</b> for Mg, Na, K, Ca, Fe, and Si. Only Al showed no difference in cumulative <b>weathering</b> due to schedule. The steady-state <b>weathering</b> rate was higher with alternate wetting and drying than continuous <b>weathering.</b> Thus, <b>weathering</b> with intermittent drying resulted in more cumulative ion removal over time than continuous <b>weathering</b> with equal volumes of solution.

40|$|This study {{describes}} <b>weathering</b> {{pattern in}} saprolites of the Vånga Granite along various profiles at Ivö Klack, Scania (southern Sweden) {{and provides a}} model against which paleo-chemical <b>weathering</b> of ancient profiles (e. g. Utsira High) can be compared. These <b>weathering</b> profiles have been analyzed combining field data with XRD, thin sections and SEM analyses. Special emphasis has been on secondary minerals formation associated with paleoclimate, composition of primary minerals and its distribution in parent rock. Intrusive origin is attributed to the Vånga Granite which has composition between monzogranite and syenogranite (plotted on Streckeisen diagram). Sericite needles identified on plagioclase grains approve post-magmatic alteration of fresh granite. Two <b>weathering</b> profiles namely; profile- 1 and profile- 2, have been investigated in detail to give a representative overview on <b>weathering</b> processes prevailed at the locality. Two <b>weathering</b> stages (initial and advanced stage of <b>weathering)</b> have been designated to <b>weathering</b> profiles based on XRD% of three minerals (kaolinite, plagioclase and K-feldspar). Chemical <b>weathering</b> reactions largely include transformation of feldspars and phyllosilicates to kaolinite, smectite, illite and vermiculite. Plagioclase, especially anorthite content, and biotite are readily affected by <b>weathering</b> whereas K-feldspar stands out as more resistant mineral phase. During initial stage of <b>weathering,</b> pore waters achieve equilibrium with K-feldspar, kaolinite and illite. As <b>weathering</b> proceeds (upon total consumption of plagioclase) formation of kaolinite increases greatly due to dissolution of potassic phases. Three clay mineral phases (smectite, illite and kaolinite) are observed in both <b>weathering</b> profiles. In most <b>weathered</b> samples from both <b>weathering</b> profiles kaolinite˃˃ illite ˃ smectite. Deep kaolinite <b>weathering</b> and argillization at the study area started in humid tropical climate of the Rhaetian. <b>Weathering</b> of bedrock continued in humid tropical to sub-tropical climate from the Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous until Campanian Sea transgressed the area.

This paper presents the characteristics of <b>weathering</b> zones of various granitic rocks in the south of Malaysia. This region has a tropical climatic condition.

Refined dating of <b>weathering</b> related minerals allow to place the <b>weathering</b> phases in their paleo -geological and -geomorphological contexts and also to better decipher the different <b>weathering</b> processes leading to the formation of these rocks. In Wallonia, <b>weathering</b> took place in several relatively short phases: Late Permian - Early Triassic, Early Cretaceous, "middle" Cretaceous, Late Paleocene - Early Eocene and Early Miocene (Dupuis et al., 1992; Yans, 2003; Barbier, 2012). Datings on saprolites of the Haute-Lesse (Transinne and Villance) and the Entre-Sambre-Et-Meuse (Morialmé) areas illustrate these different <b>weathering</b> periods. In the Entre Sambre-Et-Meuse region, a single <b>weathering</b> phase, Late Paleocene - Early Eocene in age, 55. 75 +/- 2. 35 Ma, has been identified based on radiometric da ng (K/Ar) on birnessite (hydrated form of hollandite) forming concretions coating cracks crossing the upper and lower part of the <b>weathering</b> profile (Barbier, 2012). In this area, the <b>weathered</b> profile is overlain by a fluvial channel not <b>weathered</b> and dated as earliest Eocene. Given the geological and geometric relationships of the dated Mn oxides with the whole <b>weathering</b> profile developed and the terrestrial sediments deposited at Morialmé, this age {{is supposed to be the}} last <b>weathering</b> phase affecting the area. This does not preclude that any older phases could have contributed to the <b>weathering</b> profile, and as shown by Yans (2003) in the Haute-Lesse area at Transinne. The mineralogy and geochemistry related to the <b>weathering</b> have also been studied in details at Morialmé. The result of the XRD analysis of the clay frac on and the <b>Weathering</b> Index confirm the presence of different <b>weathering</b> degrees along the profile, defined on macroscopic criteria.
