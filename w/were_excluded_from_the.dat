5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A protracted {{battle over}} parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> succession.|$|E
5|$|Since 1714, Britain {{had shared}} a monarch with Hanover in Germany, but under Salic law women <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hanoverian succession. While Victoria {{inherited}} all the British dominions, Hanover passed instead to her father's younger brother, her unpopular uncle the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who became King of Hanover. He was her heir presumptive until she {{married and had}} a child.|$|E
5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North German Confederation.|$|E

5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Although they <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> formal {{rituals of}} the temple, laymen still sought to {{interact}} with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues {{to interact with}} the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E
5|$|Cornwall County Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1894, and first competed in the Minor Counties Championship in 1904. Their first {{appearance}} in List A cricket was in 1970, and in total they have played seventeen matches, making four Gillette Cup, five NatWest Trophy and eight Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy appearances. On three occasions the county progressed to {{the third round of}} the competition: in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Minor counties teams <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> competition from the 2006 season; Cornwall's last match was against the Netherlands {{in the first round of}} the 2004 competition.|$|E

5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 a New Zealand Māori side toured Australia {{where they}} played three Test matches. The tour was {{organised}} by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) after Māori players <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks' 1949 tour to apartheid South Africa. Windon appeared {{in all three}} Tests, as well as playing for New South Wales against the tourists. He scored a try in all three Tests; the first was won by the Maori, the second a draw, and the third won by Australia.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed {{to learn that the}} statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E

On the state level, Shelby revised militia laws to make every male {{between the ages of}} 18 and 45 eligible for military service; ministers <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> provision. Seven thousand volunteers enlisted, and many more had to be turned away. Shelby encouraged the state's women to sew and knit items for Kentucky's troops.|$|E
5|$|The Old School faction was {{convinced}} that the Plan of Union with the Congregational churches had undermined Presbyterian doctrine and order. At the 1837 General Assembly, the Old School majority successfully passed resolutions removing all judicatories found under the Plan from the Presbyterian Church. In total, three synods in New York and one synod in Ohio along with 28 presbyteries, 509 ministers, and 60 thousand church members (one-fifth of the PCUSA's membership) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> church. New School leaders reacted by meeting in Auburn, New York, and issuing the Auburn Declaration, a 16-point defense of their Calvinist orthodoxy.|$|E
5|$|While blacks <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> AG {{until the}} 1960s, the denomination's work among Spanish-speaking people {{has a long}} history, first sanctioned {{explicitly}} in 1918. Hispanic outreach became independent of the Foreign Missions Department in 1929 when the first Latin American District was established. By the end of World War II, the AG's Latin American constituency formed the largest Protestant presence among Hispanics in the United States. The AG also focused on major European immigrant populations, but as later generations assimilated into American culture, these separate European segments were absorbed into the regular geographic districts.|$|E

5|$|George V's {{death in}} 1936 was {{followed}} by the accession of Edward VIII, who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry the divorced American Wallis Simpson, even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of divorcées. Accordingly, Edward announced his intention to abdicate; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries granted his request. Edward VIII and any children by his new wife <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> line of succession, and the Crown went to his brother, George VI. George served as a rallying figure for the British people during World War II, making morale-boosting visits to the troops as well as to munitions factories and to areas bombed by Nazi Germany. In June 1948 George VI relinquished the title Emperor of India, although remaining head of state of the Dominion of India.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to US involvement in World War I.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} Scotland regained its {{independent}} system of law, its parliament and its kirk, {{but also the}} Lords of the Articles (through which the crown controlled parliamentary business) and bishops. It also had a king who did not visit the country and ruled largely without reference to Parliament {{through a series of}} commissioners. These began with Middleton, now an earl, and ended with the king's brother and heir, James, Duke of York (known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany). Legislation was revoked back to 1633, by the Rescissory Act 1661, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars, but the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods were renewed. Only four Covenanters <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> general pardon and were executed, the most prominent being the Marquis of Argyll, but also including the Protester James Guthrie.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic Party Tammany Hall {{political}} machine {{had been working}} to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish, most of whom already spoke English. In March 1863, with the war continuing, Congress passed the Enrollment Act to establish a draft for the first time, as more troops were needed. In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned {{they were expected to}} register for the draft to fight for their new country. Black men <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and wealthier white men could pay for substitutes.|$|E
5|$|The Jersey Act's major {{effect was}} the {{opposite}} of what was intended. In the years before the Second World War, British and Irish breeders had relied on imported Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding lines, a source that was unavailable during the war, and concerns were beginning to be expressed that the situation might lead to excessive inbreeding. Additionally, {{by the end of the}} war American-bred lines were some of the most successful racing lines in the world, effectively making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them second-rate, and harming the rebuilding of English racing. There were even calls for the creation of an international stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees, thus eliminating any perceived slight on the bloodlines that <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation. The La Pointe Band {{was given a}} reservation at Bad River around the Band's traditional wild ricing grounds on the south shore of Lake Superior, and some reserved land for fishing grounds at the eastern tip of Madeline Island. In Minnesota, the reservations for the Fond du Lac and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band. In Michigan, reservations for the Lac Vieux Desert, Ontonagon and L'Anse bands were established. The St. Croix and Sokaogon bands left the negotiations in protest and <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> agreement.|$|E
