5|$|From 1943 to 1946 {{he worked}} at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as a group leader for the Manhattan Project. He found in April 1944 that Thin Man, the {{proposed}} plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> {{because of the presence of}} plutonium-240 impurities.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, Oppenheimer reorganized the {{laboratory}} {{to focus on}} the problem of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was necessary because the gun-type design <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> with plutonium. P Division was broken up, and Bacher became the head of the G (for Gadget) Division. This much larger division contained eleven groups headed by leaders who included William Higinbotham, Seth Neddermeyer, Edwin McMillan, Luis Alvarez and Otto Frisch.|$|E

5|$|The Mint struck pattern {{pieces of}} the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have {{differentiated}} it from the quarter, but the patterns <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing Liberty with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of the shoot, Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work.</b> Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E
5|$|For {{its fifth}} album, Pearl Jam again worked with {{producer}} Brendan O'Brien, whom the band {{had worked with}} on its previous three records. Yield was recorded throughout 1997 in Seattle, Washington at Studio X and Studio Litho, the latter of {{which is owned by}} guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was then mixed by O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album would be the last collaboration with O'Brien for several years. They <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> with the producer again until he was brought on board in 2008 to remix their debut album Ten and to produce 2009's Backspacer.|$|E
50|$|Of {{much larger}} size, the Silbervogel {{antipodal}} bomber spaceplane was planned by the Germans late in World War II, however later calculations {{showed that it}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>worked,</b> and <b>would</b> have been destroyed during reentry.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the expected staff absentee rates and work attitudes in an Australian tertiary hospital workforce in two hypothetical scenarios: (i) a single admission of avian influenza; and (ii) multiple admissions of human pandemic influenza. Methods: A survey conducted at hospital staff meetings between May and August 2006. Results: Out of 570 questionnaires distributed, 560 were completed. For scenario one, 72 (13 %) {{indicated that they}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> attend <b>work,</b> and an additional 136 (25 %) would only work provided that immunizations and/or antiviral medications were immediately available, so that up to 208 (38 %) <b>would</b> <b>not</b> attend <b>work.</b> For scenario two, 196 (36 %) <b>would</b> <b>not</b> attend <b>work,</b> and an additional 95 (17 %) would work only if immunizations and/or antiviral medications were immediately available, so that up to 291 (53 %) staff <b>would</b> <b>not</b> attend <b>work.</b> Staff whose work required them {{to be in the}} ED (odds ratios 2. 2 and 1. 6 for each scenario respectively) or on acute medical wards (odds ratios 2. 2 and 2. 0 respectively) were more likely to work. Conclusion: High absenteeism among hospital staff should be anticipated if patients are admitted with either avian or pandemic influenza, particularly if specific antiviral preventative measures are not immediately available. Measures to maximize the safety of staff and their families would be important incentives to attend work. Education on realistic level of risk from avian and pandemic influenza, as well as the effectiveness of basic infection control procedures and personal protective equipment, would be useful in improving willingness to work.

5|$|Henry Moore {{was born}} in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale {{colliery}} in Castleford. He was an autodidact {{with an interest in}} music and literature. Determined that his sons <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.|$|E

However, he later reveals that he was feared as a child soldier—known as —who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past. This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work.</b> Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he does not have free will. Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work,</b> but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed to shrink the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} has been {{complicated by the}} most recent revision of the Holidays Act. The holiday is Mondayised only if the employee <b>would</b> <b>not</b> usually <b>work</b> on weekends. For example, an office worker who works only Monday to Friday would get to the Statutory holidays on the Monday (or Tuesday for days that fell on Sundays).

5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they {{began to think about}} {{what had happened to the}} characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of the 2017 film Logan, its {{theatrical}} runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before Logan in place of a traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> with Type-C sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of White Finland, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's first senate, {{was called the}} Vaasa Senate after relocation to the west-coast city of Vaasa, acting as {{the capital of the}} Whites from 29 January to 3 May. In domestic policy the White Senate's main goal was to return the political right to power in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported monarchy and opposed democracy; others approved parliamentarianism since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917-1918 concluded, that empowering the common people <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work.</b> Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Oppenheimer {{attempted}} to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher {{to work at}} the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work,</b> since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of TNT equivalent (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E

5|$|True Detective was {{intended}} to be a novel, but once the project took definite form, Pizzolatto thought the narrative's shifts in time and perspective made it more suitable for television. He pitched an adaptation of Galveston, and from May to July 2010 he developed six screenplays, including an early, 90-page draft of the True Detective pilot script. Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series shortly thereafter. He wrote a second True Detective script soon after his departure from The Killing thanks to the support of production company and manager Anonymous Content, which ultimately produced and developed the project in-house. By April 2012, following a heated bidding period, HBO commissioned eight episodes of True Detective. Pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff because he believed a collaborative approach <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> with his isolated, novelistic process, and that a group would not achieve his desired result. After working alone for about three months, the final copy of the project script was 500 pages long.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not {{do as well as}} the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E

40|$|This paper surveys {{independent}} Ireland’s {{economic policies}} and performance. It has three main messages. First, the economic history of post-independence Ireland {{was not particularly}} unusual. Very often, things that were happening in Ireland were happening elsewhere as well. Second, {{for a long time}} we were hampered by an excessive dependence on a poorly performing UK economy. And third, EC membership in 1973, and the Single Market programme of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, were absolutely crucial for us. Irish independence and EU membership have complemented each other, rather than being in conflict: each was required to give full effect to the other. Irish independence <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>worked</b> as well for us as it did without the EU; and the EU <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>worked</b> as well for us as it did without political independence...|$|R
