2500|$|From 1859 until 1866, the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia had a red-yellow-blue Romanian tricolor, with {{horizontal}} stripes, {{as national}} flag. The flag was described properly in Almanahul român din 1866: [...] "a tricolor flag, divided in three stripes, red, yellow {{and blue and}} laid out horizontally: red above, blue below and yellow in the middle". Although the Ottoman Empire did not allow the United Principalities {{to have their own}} symbols, the new flag gained a degree of international recognition. Relating prince Cuza's May–June 1864 journey to Constantinople, doctor Carol Davila observed: [...] "The Romanian flag was raised on the great mast, the Sultan's kayaks awaited us, the guard was armed, the Grand Vizier at the door... The Prince, quiet, dignified, concise in his speech, spent 20 minutes with the Sultan, who then came to review us… Once again, the Grand Vizier led the Prince to the main gate and <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Europe Palace, the Romanian flag still fluttering on the mast...".|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{others and}} told them {{everything}} that we had learned from Shadrach.|$|E

60|$|I {{ordered the}} taxi closed and <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel. The hall porter drew me {{on one side}} confidentially.|$|E
60|$|Declaring {{that there}} was no {{alternative}} but compliance, Media acceded; and with the king's messengers <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> glen.|$|E
60|$|Together <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell {{in which}} Xodar sat; {{descending}} {{to talk with}} him until the hour had passed.|$|E

60|$|It was a hint {{not to be}} neglected, and <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tavern where don Felipe had his nip.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Garden,[FN#66] {{and prayed}} another two-bow prayer, ending, as we began, with {{the worship of}} the Creator.|$|E
60|$|As for Charles and myself, <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. Half an {{hour later}} Forbes-Gaskell came back, too, in a towering temper.|$|E
60|$|Without apologising {{for this}} digression, <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thread of our tale.|$|R
60|$|Once again <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great city, and to Mrs Frog's poor lodging.|$|R

60|$|Perry had got {{to taking}} stock of our {{ammunition}} each time <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hut. It became {{something of an}} obsession with him.|$|E
60|$|We {{listened for}} a long time for the sound again; but as it did not come, <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bower and resumed our work.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll get it," [...] he responded, confidently. And {{a little}} later <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room where our psychic was sitting, still in deep trance.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, when it grew {{dark and}} <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house, I noticed that Dan was rather pale and quiet. He {{lay down on}} the kitchen sofa.|$|E
60|$|When Perry was rested <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prospector, {{where he}} fitted himself out fully like a civilized human being--under-clothing, socks, shoes, khaki jacket and {{breeches}} and good, substantial puttees.|$|E

60|$|The {{prospect}} of the waterfall, {{as seen from the}} opposite bank, presented even greater difficulties, to an amateur artist like me, than the prospect which he had just left. <b>We</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summer-house.|$|E
