"Bossy" [...] {{was written}} by Shaffer Smith, known by his stage name Ne-Yo, while {{additional}} writing and song production was done by Stargate members Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. In the beginning of May 2008, a clip of the song leaked on YouTube. As a result, Universal Motown released the full song to media outlets on May 7, 2008. In an interview with Billboard, Ne-Yo revealed that he was approached by the label to write a song for Lohan: [...] "I gotta admit, we were like ... Lindsay Lohan?' I mean, I've written for Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Celine Dion and ... Lindsay Lohan? But I will say this; we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job. I was so shocked I had to call her and apologize for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> because she did so good. I think the world is gonna be surprised." [...] In an interview with People Magazine, he revealed the song [...] "it's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it. In this case, 'Bossy' is a term that describes confidence and power." [...] "Bossy" [...] was digitally released on May 27, 2008, and it was set to appear on Lohan's third studio album.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking.</b> You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album artwork {{features}} Jepsen {{sitting in}} a reserved position as she dons a technicolor sweater and tights: [...] "There were a few different pictures that had more of a decided facial expression, but I kind of {{liked the fact that}} I can't totally read <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> in that picture. It could be many things, and this album, to me, was sort of a collection of many different emotions." [...] The artwork's typography bears the dictionary entry of [...] "Emotion" [...] as a noun.|$|E
2500|$|... "Face in the Sand" [...] {{is based}} on the media {{coverage}} surrounding the Iraq War, taking place as the album was being recorded. Dickinson explains, [...] "I remember thinking about the desert sands as an image and how it moves and shifts with time. Specifically <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> was that whatever empires you tend to build – whether they are British, American, Iraqi or whatever, they'll all crumble and fade away into something else. So, to my mind at least, {{the best thing you can}} hope for, if you were to leave anything behind, is just an imprint in the sand." [...] The song is notable for being the first and only Iron Maiden track in which McBrain uses a double bass pedal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day. That's when our marriage started breaking up. She never knew what I was talking about, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about, and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In remarks aired by the CNN program D.L. Hughley Breaks the News on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, {{rather than}} Limbaugh, is [...] "the de facto {{leader of the}} Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking.</b> It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} {{and success of}} her album Loud (2010), Rihanna {{originally}} revealed via Twitter that the album would be re-issued with new songs and released in Fall 2011, writing that [...] "he [...] continues with more new music to add to [...] collection". In September 2011, Rihanna again took to the social networking site {{to confirm that the}} plans had been scrapped, with the singer tweeting [...] "I [...] a , but LOUD is its own body of work! Plus [...] guys work so hard that [...] deserve to act brand new". On September 19, 2011, Rihanna further provoked excitement amongst her followers when she posted that she was listening to the song, only to be re-tweeted by Calvin Harris, who replied [...] "Sometimes it feels like we find love in the most hopeless place", suggesting that his response contained possible lyrics from the song. In an interview with Capital FM, Harris – who produced the track – explained that followers of Rihanna had sent messages to him regarding their expectations of the song, saying [...] "The song better not be rubbish", which he interpreted as slightly threatening, but {{went on to say that}} [...] "it's all part of the fun". In an interview for Q magazine, Harris said of the lyric, [...] "we found love in a hopeless place," [...] "It could have been Jumpin Jaks in Dumfries (Harris' home town), I don't know exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about." ...|$|E
