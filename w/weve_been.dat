40|$|To {{evaluate}} the venous flow dynamics in systemic and plumonary veins, we analyzed Doppler flow signals in superior vena cava (SVCF) and left upper plumonary veins (PVF : by transesophageal echo) in 14 normal subjects c and 26 patients including 10 with anterior myocardial infardtion (AMI), 8 with inferior myocardial infarction (IMI), and 8 with hypertrophic cardio cardiomyopathy (HCM). In all subjects biphasic systolic forward flow was recognized (S 1, S 2). The timing of S 1 showed rough correlation between SVCF and PVF (r＝ 0. 50, p＜ 0. 01). In each group, peak velocities of S 1 and S 2 in PVF were larger than thosein SVCF and peak velocity ratio (pV-S 1 /S 2) of PVF {{was significantly higher}} than that in SVCF except IMI group. The time-integral ratio of S 1 to total systolic flow in PVF was also larger than that in SVCF. These results indicated that the contribution of S 1 to atrial reservioir function was larger in PVF than that in SVCF. In IMI, both peal velocity ratio and time-integral ratio in PVF were higher than in C group, suggesting that increased S 1 <b>weve</b> <b>was</b> probably due to augmented left atrial contraction and relaxation resulted from severe impairment of left ventricular diastolic property. This tendency was also seen in SVCF, suggesting that severe damage of ventricular septum and pericardial effect might affect right ventricular diastoloc performance, and hyperkinetic motion of interatrial septum might enlarge S 1 of SVCF. Acceleration rate (ACR) od S 1 wave in PVF showed rough correlation with left ventricular end-diastoloc pressure (LVEDP, r＝ 0. 54, p＜ 0. 01) in patients except HCM group. In HCM group as well as AMI group, it was recoginized that increased peal A wave velocity, increased LVEDP and augmentation of S 1 contribution to left atrial reservoir function. But, was significantly decreased in HCM group, suggesting impairment of left artial relaxation itself. This tendency was also seen in SVCF. Venous flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography would enable us to evaluate both of atrial function...|$|R

40|$|A {{clinical}} {{classification of}} serum polarographic protein <b>weves</b> (PPW) <b>was</b> attempted, arid four main types were found. The classifications {{are as follows}} : 1) normal type 2) ascending type, which is observed in cancer and inflammatory diseases, 3) decending type, which is observed in cirrhosis of the liver, and 4) sub-ascending type, which is observed in nephrotic syndrome. According to studies on the electrophoretical protein patterns of the sera, carried out in Mehl's acetic acid buffer (pH 4. 5), {{it was observed that}} M- 1 and M- 2 peaks appeared in sera exhibiting ascending PPW-patterns, while in sera exhibiting normal and descending PPW-patterns the peaks did not appear. Mucoprotein levels (Tyrosine method) were definitely correlated with PPW-heights, however non-glucosamine polysaccharide levels (Tryptophane method) were not invariably correlated with wave-heights. Therefore, it is surmised that the mucoprotein content of the sera plays an important rifle in the appearance of pathological PPW, and that the mucoprotein level coincides with electrophoretical M-peaks...|$|R

5000|$|It {{gave us a}} huge shot in the arm. Soundtracks {{have a way of}} {{perpetuating the}} life of the song and when youre {{involved}} with something as popular as Twilight, it opens up a lot of new territory. Stephenie Meyer, who {{is the author of the}} Twilight books, is a big fan of Collective Soul and she handpicked every song on the entire first soundtrack. <b>Weve</b> <b>been</b> fortunate in our career to have those moments. [...] "Run" [...] was on the Varsity Blues soundtrack and [...] "She Said" [...] was on the Scream 2 soundtrack. Soundtracks widen your exposure to people who might not normally pay attention to your music. I can look back on my youth and the soundtrack for Singles played a very big role in my life. It was just as popular as any Alice in Chains or Pearl Jam record and exposed me to a lot of great music. Twilight has exposed us to a new generation of fans.

[...] Then when wed play something older like [...] "December" [...] or [...] "Shine," [...] you could almost read their lips: [...] "I didnt know they played that song?"

We didnt do a red carpet, we just did a friends and family screening on the eve of its release. I even bought drinks at my own premiere! Its generated warmth but I think - are we allowed to say things like its a peculiarly British film? It feels different? Its a little bit quirky? Its got an intentional DIY feel to it? Its meant to be like that. I think maybe thats something people have picked up on. Superhero films arent so much our cultural history, but we do that kind of comedy really well.
