40|$|When {{presented}} with responses of another person, people incorporate these responses into memory reports: a finding termed memory conformity. Research on memory conformity in recognition reveals that people rely on external social cues {{to guide their}} memory responses when their own ability to respond is at chance. In this way, conforming <b>to</b> a <b>reliable</b> <b>source</b> boosts recognition performance but conforming to a random source does not impair it. In the present study we assessed whether people would conform indiscriminately <b>to</b> <b>reliable</b> and unreliable (random) sources when they are {{given the opportunity to}} exercise metamemory control over their responding by withholding answers in a recognition test. In Experiments 1 and 2, we found the pattern of memory conformity <b>to</b> <b>reliable</b> and unreliable <b>sources</b> in 2 variants of a free-report recognition test, {{yet at the same time}} the provision of external cues did not affect the rate of response withholding. In Experiment 3, we provided participants with initial feedback on their recognition decisions, facilitating the discrimination between the <b>reliable</b> and unreliable <b>source.</b> This led to the reduction of memory conformity to the unreliable source, and at the same time modulated metamemory decisions concerning response withholding: participants displayed metamemory confor- mity <b>to</b> the <b>reliable</b> <b>source,</b> volunteering more responses in their memory report, and metamemory resistance to the random source, withholding more responses from the memory report. Together, the results show how metamemory decisions dissociate various types of memory conformity and that memory and metamemory decisions can be independent of each other...|$|R

The equilibrium between random energy, random data and random leakage results in an interesting performance analysis of these small but ubiquitous systems as a whole.

The costumes worn by dancers are based on traditional outfits with trendy elements added to them, such as oversized sunglasses and LED lights.
