25|$|The inn {{was forced}} to move with the {{expansion}} of U.S. Route 202. U.S. 202 is a major north-south highway that passes through the town from southwest to northeast. Its construction as a modern expressway would have caused {{the destruction of the}} King of Prussia Inn; however, historic preservationists managed to prevail upon the state of Pennsylvania to avoid this important structure by building north and southbound lanes on either side of it. For more than a quarter century the inn was marooned on a median island, with motor traffic <b>whizzing</b> past on both sides. It was sealed up for years, surrounded by a high fence. The inn was successfully relocated in 2000 and opened to the public in October 2002.|$|E

500|$|Things did {{not always}} work out {{according}} to plan at such executions; at a mass execution at Firozpur in 1857, there was an order that blank cartridge should be used, but some loaded with grapeshot instead. Several of the spectators facing the cannons were hit by the grapeshot and some had to have limbs amputated as a result. In addition, some of the soldiers had not been withdrawn properly and sustained damages by being hit by <b>whizzing</b> pieces of flesh and bone. In another case, a soldier who was to be shot managed to fall down just as the shot went off, with the resulting scene taking place: ...|$|E
500|$|Musical tones {{produced}} by the human voice and all acoustical musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees. Most consonants in human speech (e.g., the sounds of f, v, s, z, both voiced and unvoiced th, Scottish and German ch) are characterised by distinctive noises, and even vowels are not entirely noise free. Wind instruments include the <b>whizzing</b> or hissing sounds of air breaking against {{the edges of the}} mouthpiece, while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute, when the instrument is poor or the player unskilful, to what is perceived as a poor tone. When they are not excessive, listeners [...] "make themselves deaf" [...] to these noises by ignoring them.|$|E

Nevertheless, he limited their daily distances to , to preserve the strength of dogs and men. In the 24-hour daylight the party travelled during the notional night, to keep the sun at their backs and thus reduce the danger of snow-blindness. [...] Guided by the snow cairns built on their outward journey, they reached the Butchers' Shop on 4 January 1912, and began the descent to the Barrier. [...] The men on skis [...] "went <b>whizzing</b> down", but for the sledge drivers—Helmer Hanssen and Wisting—the descent was precarious; the sledges were hard to manoeuvre, and brakes {{were added to the}} runners to enable rapid stops when crevasses were encountered.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary press {{reaction}} to 2K and their Barbican performance was mixed but mostly negative. Since then, however, The Observer have {{held up the}} Barbican show as the model of a pop performance.

[...] at the tops of their voices ..." [...] Likewise, a 1999 feature on Drummond and Cauty in The Irish Times reported their millennium activities with some warmth.

500|$|The {{original}} {{production in}} Houston received mixed reviews. Chicago Tribune critic John von Rhein called Nixon in China [...] "an operatic triumph of grave and thought-provoking beauty". Houston Chronicle reviewer Ann Holmes {{said of the}} work, [...] "The music of [...] "Nixon" [...] catches in your ear; I find myself singing it while <b>whizzing</b> along the freeways." [...] Los Angeles Herald-Examiner critic Mark Swed wrote that it would [...] "bear relevance {{for as long as}} mankind cherished humanity". Martin Bernheimer, writing in the Los Angeles Times, drew attention to the choreography of Morris ("the trendy enfant terrible of modern dance") in the Act 2 ballet sequences. Morris had produced [...] "one of those classical yet militaristic Sino-Soviet ballets from the revolutionary repertory of Mme. Mao". Bernheimer also praised [...] "the subtle civility of Alice Goodman's couplet-dominated libretto".|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it {{four out of}} five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers, it is [...] "equally possible they will keep watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves". Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are <b>whizzing</b> by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..." [...] Lastly, Wagner observed that [...] "Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created".|$|E

500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come <b>whizzing</b> in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E
500|$|Madsen {{tried to}} explore this [...] "moral dilemma", [...] "the drama behind {{the story of the}} 'illegals'" [...] and human {{psychology}} in crisis situations. Madsen ultimately defined his film [...] "as an investigation of what happens psychologically to someone who sacrifices himself in war". Because of this, he portrayed Flammen and Citron as [...] "modern heroes with cracks in their souls and doubts and insecurities". Citron even reflected upon killing people but [...] "he did it. He sold out his humanity for the highest price." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described the story as [...] "a psychologically complex look at what heroism does to heroes. The actions these men take tear at their lives, their families, their very essence." [...] Morgenstern analysed it as [...] "a meditation on the nature of heroism, and the quest for purity of purpose". Turan even said it is [...] "more nihilistic than idealistic", while Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer asserted that it [...] "balances the <b>whizzing</b> bullets and political intrigue with an elegiac tone and an existential edge just this side of nihilism". Its depiction of the resistance in a non-heroic way made it a [...] "one-off film" [...] in Danish cinema, according to film historian Lars-Martin Sørensen.|$|E
