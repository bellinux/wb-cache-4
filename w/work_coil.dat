50|$|In {{practice}} the metal workpiece to be fabricated {{is placed in}} proximity to a heavily constructed coil of wire (called the <b>work</b> <b>coil).</b> A huge pulse of current is forced through the <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> by rapidly discharging a high voltage capacitor bank using an ignitron or a spark gap as a switch.

50|$|The high <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> current (typically tens or {{hundreds}} of thousands of amperes) creates ultrastrong magnetic forces that easily overcome the yield strength of the metal work piece, causing permanent deformation. The metal forming process occurs extremely quickly (typically tens of microseconds) and, because of the large forces, portions of the workpiece undergo high acceleration reaching velocities of up to 300 m/s.|$|E

50|$|Induction heating is {{the process}} of heating an {{electrically}} conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, through heat generated in the object by eddy currents. An induction heater consists of an electromagnet, and an electronic oscillator that passes a high-frequency alternating current (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating magnetic field penetrates the object, generating electric currents inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the material heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials like iron, heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses. The frequency of current used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.|$|E

5000|$|A {{source of}} high {{frequency}} electricity {{is used to}} drive a large alternating current through a coil. The passage of current through this coil generates a very intense and rapidly changing magnetic field in the space within the <b>work</b> <b>coil.</b> The workpiece to be heated is placed within this intense alternating magnetic field where eddy currents are generated within the workpiece and resistance leads to Joule heating of the metal. This operation is most commonly used in steel alloys. Many mechanical parts, such as shafts, gears, and springs, are subjected to surface treatments, before the delivering, {{in order to improve}} wear behavior. The effectiveness of these treatments depends both on surface materials properties modification and on the introduction of residual stress. Among these treatments, induction hardening {{is one of the most}} widely employed to improve component durability. It determines in the work-piece a tough core with tensile residual stresses and a hard surface layer with compressive stress, which have proved to be very effective in extending the component fatigue life and wear resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{oscillator}} circuit {{is responsible}} for creating the elevated frequency electric current, which when applied to the <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> creates the magnetic field which heats the part. The basic elements of the circuit are an inductance (tank coil) and a capacitance (tank capacitor) and an oscillator valve. Basic electrical principles dictate that if a voltage is applied to a circuit containing a capacitor and inductor the circuit will oscillate {{in much the same}} way as a swing which has been pushed. Using our swing as an analogy if we do not push again at the right time the swing will gradually stop this is the same with the oscillator. The purpose of the valve is to act as a switch which will allow energy to pass into the oscillator at the correct time to maintain the oscillations. In order to time the switching, a small amount of energy is fed back to the grid of the triode effectively blocking or firing the device or allow it to conduct at the correct time. This so-called grid bias can be derived, either capacitively, conductively or inductively depending on whether the oscillator is a Colpitts, Hartley oscillator, Armstrong tickler or a Meissner.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{induction}} hardening machines are utilized in the industries which produce machine parts and tools {{needed to achieve}} high wear resistance. If they are constructed in local, the industries can utilize them commonly and easily. As the machines are designed and constructed {{in accordance with the}} desired products, the quality of products is higher and the products can be used efficiently. In the study of Design and Construction of Induction Hardening Machine, the design of <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> is presented. A small model {{induction hardening}} machine is designed for the output power 5 kW and operation frequency 35 kHz. As the <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> {{is the heart of the}} machine, a good coil design reduces power requirement and causes good efficiency. The design of <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> that causes the most magnetic flux density in the work piece, the least power consumption and develops desired heat during limited time is studied. It has been attempted to design the helical multi-turn type of <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> for any size of cylindrical shape of work piece with uniform surface.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the power needs and impedance-matching techniques involved when heating small charges of relatively high-resistivity semiconductor materials.

Considerable emphasis is placed on the efficiency of coupling between the induction heater and the load. Different methods of coupling the power into loads of silicon and germanium are indicated. The discussion on coupling centers around two <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> designs, a single-turn coil and impedance-matching transformer, and a five-turn coil, which is connected in series with the tank-circuit coil.

40|$|<b>Working</b> <b>coils</b> for {{electromagnetic}} forming processes need {{to comply}} with a wide list of requirements such as durability, efficiency and a tailored pressure distribution. Due to its unique combination of high strength and high electrical conductivity CuCr 1 Zr meets these requirements and is a common material for coil turns. In combination with conventional coil production processes like winding or waterjet cutting the use of this material is state of the art. A promising approach for coil production is the use of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. In comparison to conventional manufacturing processes, AM offers tremendous advantages such as feature-integration e. g. undercuts or lattice structures. However, this increased design freedom only leads to improved working coils if copper alloys with high strength and high electrical conductivity such as CuCr 1 Zr can be processed. Due to the high thermal conductivity and reflectivity the use of suchlike materials in additive manufacturing processes is challenging. Considering the effects of the required pre- and post-processing treatments for additive manufactured parts the need for research is further increased. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a method for the qualification of CuCr 1 Zr for the selective laser melting (SLM) process. This comprises the powder characterization, the process parameter identification and the microstructure investigation of the generated test geometries...|$|R

40|$|The Q Meter has {{frequently}} {{been described as}} one of the most flexible instruments available with applications limited largely by the ingenuity of the person using it. It is our desire here to delineate some of those techniques, not normally encountered in everyday work, in the hope that wider dissemination of information gathered through many channels, will prove of some value. In order to approach our specific problems in a general way, it might be well to review some basic facts relative to the operation of the Q Meter. The Q Meter is always operated with-a coil connected to its coil terminals. If we are interested in measuring the Q of a coil, this coil will be connected to these terminals and it will be measured in one operation. If we are interested in making other measurements; (i. e., the Q of a capacitor, the impedance of a circuit, the parameters of a tuned circuit; etc.), we still need a coil, even though we are interested in that particular coil only as. a reference. This so-called “work coil “ would probably be a shielded unit to prevent stray coupling, hand-capacitance effects, etc.; and might be selected for its inductance, Q; etc., as needed for the particular application involved. In making measurements (other than the Q of a coil} of circuit parameters there will be two steps involved. The first will be with the <b>work</b> <b>coil</b> mounted on the Q meter, where the resonating capacitance (Cl), circuit Q (Ql), and frequency will be recorded.
