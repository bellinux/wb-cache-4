5|$|The baby drifts downriver to {{a village}} of the Nelwyn (dwarves). She comes into the care of Willow Ufgood, a kind farmer and conjurer who hopes to become a real sorcerer; his wife Kiaya and his {{children}} {{fall in love with}} the baby immediately, and Willow too soon grows to love her as one of his own. During a town festival, the village is attacked by a Nockmaar hound which is quickly killed by the village warriors. The High Aldwin, the village sorcerer, learns about the baby and selects Willow, due to his devotion to the child, to accompany a party of volunteers returning the baby to the Daikini (human) people. At a crossroads, they find a human warrior named Madmartigan trapped in a crow's cage. The rest of the party <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> baby to Madmartigan and go home immediately, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, so the others leave. After spending the night at the crossroads and meeting an army led by Airk Thaughbaer, an old friend of Madmartigan's marching against Bavmorda, Willow reluctantly decides to free Madmartigan so that he can take care of the baby for them.|$|E
25|$|Although the Danish Army {{had been}} forewarned of the attack, it was denied {{permission}} to deploy or prepare defensive positions as the Danish {{government did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> Germans any provocation for their actions. All that was available to meet the land invasion were small and scattered units of the frontier guard and elements of the Jutland division. Believing attack was imminent, the troops were placed on full alert at 13:30 on 8 April.|$|E
25|$|Churchill's {{other main}} concern while Colonial Secretary was the Middle East. He wanted Egypt (then {{administered}} by the Foreign Office) to be brought under his department's control. He was faced with continuing riots and communal violence in {{those parts of the}} former Ottoman Empire that British forces occupied after World War I. Most of these riots were against the British occupation. Churchill did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> complete independence that some of the Arabs had been promised. Rather, his aims were to reduce the British forces in the region and to ensure that British interests, particularly in the air route to India and the oil fields, were protected. The local population was a less important issue.|$|E

25|$|In March 1960, first-term U.S. Senator Richard L. Neuberger died in office. Despite {{calls to}} appoint his widow, Maurine Brown Neuberger, to the position, Governor Mark Hatfield instead {{appointed}} Oregon Supreme Court justice Hall S. Lusk {{to fill the}} position until a November special election. Hatfield stated {{that he intended to}} have appointed Neuberger, but that he wanted to appoint someone who would be focused on completing the remaining eight months of the term and not running in the regular-term Senate election as Neuberger had announced she would. Some observers noted that Hatfield, a Republican, though required by state law to appoint someone of the same political party as the late Senator Neuberger, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> other party the political advantage of incumbency.|$|E
500|$|Grace Lee Whitney was {{released}} {{during the filming}} of the first season. The official reason given for Whitney's departure from the show was that her character limited romantic possibilities for Captain Kirk. This idea was supported by Whitney, saying [...] "They didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> fans the idea [...] {{was in love with}} Janice Rand. That would limit him. They wanted him to go out and fool around. So, I was axed." ...|$|E

Ted Bundy died in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16a.m. EST on January 24, 1989; he was 42 years old. Hundreds of revelers—including 20 off-duty police officers, by one account—sang, danced and set off fireworks in a pasture {{across the street from the}} prison as the execution was carried out, then cheered loudly as the white hearse containing Bundy's corpse departed the prison. His remains were cremated in Gainesville, and the ashes scattered at an undisclosed location in the Cascade Range of Washington State, in accordance with his will.|$|E

500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> impression that the guests on the first album {{were part of the}} band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. We thought we could do something just a little more groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E
500|$|When Lawrence {{was first}} told he should meet Mars he was {{reluctant}} to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for The Black Eyed Peas, told him: [...] "Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you." [...] Lawrence responded: [...] "Just give me five dollars back for the bus." [...] The pair began collaborating, writing songs for Mars, but they received many rejections from labels. On the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. He liked their song [...] "Lost", which was written for Mars. The duo did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> song away, but when they were offered $20,000 for it they agreed. The sale of this song allowed them to continue working, and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs together for other artists. Eventually, Creed became Mars' manager for nine years.|$|E
500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> impression we were sucking up".|$|E

500|$|The Saints, having {{achieved}} their first winning record in team history, clinched their first-ever playoff spot by defeating the Buccaneers 44–34. The Saints led {{the game for}} good after two early Vinny Testaverde fumbles deep in Buccaneer territory. Testaverde was given the starting job over Steve DeBerg, a change that was not revealed until gametime. [...] "(Perkins) didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> Saints {{time to prepare for}} anything new", said Testaverde. In the second half, Testaverde made the Saints nervous by rallying the Buccaneers to score on four consecutive possessions. Mark Carrier's 212yards on eight receptions set a team record, and Bruce Hill contributed 73yards on five receptions. The rally lifted team spirits. [...] "There's definitely some {{light at the end of}} the tunnel, and it's not a train", said Perkins. The rally came after a turbulent halftime, in which Ron Heller urged his teammates not to quit. Ray Perkins, hearing only the word [...] "quit", punched Heller in the head, breaking his thumb on Heller's helmet. The Saints' first playoff-clinching win came on the tenth anniversary of the Buccaneers' first victory in franchise history, also a road game against the Saints.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Wipeout 2097 was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and the promotional art was designed by Sheffield-based The Designers Republic. The development cycle ran seven months. To cater for the increase in Wipeout players, an easier learning curve was introduced whilst keeping the difficulty at top end for the experienced gamers. The game was originally intended as a tracks add-on for the original Wipeout. No sequel had been planned, but Andy Satterthwaite (who worked on the MS-DOS version of the original) was asked by Psygnosis {{to apply for the}} role [...] "internal producer". He did, and during the interview, asked to do a sequel to Wipeout, but instead ended up developing extra tracks. The add-on was titled Wipeout 2097 because Psygnosis did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> impression that it was a full sequel. In the United States, it went by the name of Wipeout XL because it was felt that American players would not understand the concept of the game being set a century in the future. The American title was originally to be Wipeout XS (for [...] "Excess"), but it was pointed out that XS could also stand for [...] "extra small". Satterthwaite ended up with a team of two coders (two of who were new), six artists, and Nick Burcombe.|$|E
500|$|She had {{her usual}} {{domestic}} success in 1993, {{including a new}} record time in the Coast to Coast. Her focus sharpened in early 1994 {{when it was announced}} that mountain biking would be an Olympic event at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Although she would be 39 then, she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> selectors an opportunity to look past her. The 1994 domestic mountain bike season was the most competitive yet, with Kate Rattray and the visiting Susan DeMattei providing good competition, but it was 1995 where it counted. Rather than go for another veteran's medal, Lynch entered the Pro race at the 1995 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in Kirchzarten in Germany's Black Forest. Lynch had a fierce start of the cross country race and led the field into the first climb. One by one, younger and full-time professional cylists went past her, and Lynch ended up 21st, with Mary Grigson 33rd, and the other Kiwis further back. They had gained New Zealand two qualifying positions for the Olympics; no New Zealand men qualified. Grigson accepted an offer to race for Australia and left New Zealand (she competed at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000), so the New Zealand Mountain Bike Association decided to nominate just one competitor for the New Zealand Olympic team. The team was announced on 16 April 1996 and Lynch's name came up. This was by no means a foregone conclusion, and Lynch thinks that she was selected against the selection panel's inclinations: ...|$|E

When asked about For Keeps (1988), Ringwald said, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> wrong message to teenagers. I sort of felt a certain {{responsibility}} – I mean, I was a very, very famous teenager and I thought a lot of teenagers were looking up to me and emulating me, and I really didn't want to make a movie that said in any way that having a baby at that age was going to be easy."

I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> producers the impression that I'm sitting waiting." [...] It was later revealed that Serkis would also serve as second unit director on the films. Serkis stated, [...] "I think I understand Peter's sensibility and we have a common history of understanding Middle-earth. A lot of the crew from The Lord of the Rings was returning to work on The Hobbit. There is really a sense of Peter wanting people around him who totally understand the material and the work ethic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Halim Barakat {{described}} MEMRI as [...] "a propaganda {{organization dedicated}} to representing Arabs and Muslims as anti-semites". Barakat claims an essay he wrote for the Al-Hayat Daily of London titled The Wild Beast that Zionism Created: Self-Destruction, was mistranslated by MEMRI and retitled as Jews Have Lost Their Humanity. Barakat further stated [...] "Every time I wrote Zionism, MEMRI replaced the word by Jew or Judaism. They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> impression that I'm not criticizing Israeli policy, but that what I'm saying is anti-Semitic." [...] According to Barakat, he was subject to widespread condemnation from faculty and his office was [...] "flooded with hatemail". Fellow Georgetown faculty member Aviel Roshwald accused Barakat in an article he published of promoting a [...] "demonization of Israel and of Jews". Supported by Georgetown colleagues, Barakat denied the claim, which Roshwald had based on MEMRI's translation of Barakat's essay.|$|E

If Norman had no other spells, then Tom's Shock would resolve first and deal 2 damage to the Grizzly Bears, killing them. His Giant Growth would then go to the graveyard with no effect because the Bears would no longer be on the battlefield and would thus be an illegal target. Fortunately for Norman, he has another spell to cast. He taps a Plains and casts [...] targeting his Grizzly Bears. Now Mending Hands is on top of the stack, with Shock and then Giant Growth beneath it.|$|E
2500|$|That is not surprising.
