5000|$|The ship's single sail had {{probably}} been taken down before she sank as the stern contained more than 100 lead rigging rings from a large square sail stowed there. The wooden hull, built mostly of pine (pinus brutia), was preserved for a length of almost 14,7 metres originally measured long, by 4,4 metres across. The ship was built by using the [...] "shell first" [...] ancient method, rather the opposite of today's method. Contrary to the contemporary wood boat building method where a complete skeleton of frames of the entire vessel must first be constructed, in this case, the planking from the keel and up was joined together using a mortice-and-tenon construction and then the frames were laid in, secured with an ingenious assembly of hollow cylindrical softwood inserts hosting internal copper nails passing through both frames and planks. The ship was intended for long service and underwent four major repairs in her life. In the last repair her owner(s) had a skin of lead sheathing of 1,5 to 2 millimeters thickness applied to her body to hopefully keep the old ship comparatively safe from woodworm and probably help <b>watertightness.</b> Carbon 14 dating of the ship's planks gives a date of 389 BC (plus or minus 44 years).

Existing methodologies to establish test conditions only partially consider co-occurrence of rain and wind, which yields large uncertainties when determining return periods for extreme wind-driven rain events. This paper presents a new approach based on a Pareto fronts method for which wind driven rain intensities and wind pressures are derived. Straight lines can be fitted to consecutive fronts, and a generalized Pareto distribution describes the corresponding probabilities of occurrence of wind-driven rain events. Assumptions {{in the use of}} the methods are given and constraints to its use provided by means of case-studies. Advantages over existing methods for estimating <b>watertightness</b> test parameters are highlighted. Test conditions can be calculated for various configurations and different averaging periods depending on the failure behavior of specific building envelop components. Subsequently it is shown that the conversion of case-based test conditions to generic test protocols and performance levels requires careful consideration. Finally, the paper provides practical guidelines on defining realistic <b>watertightness</b> performance levels for building envelop components. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

Irrespective of the broad spectrum of research on wind loads, rainfall and wind driven rain (WDR) intensity, little information is available concerning the scientific basis for <b>watertightness</b> test methods or performance criteria. This paper provides an overview of existing methodologies to establish test conditions and a critical review of calculation methods for wind and WDR loads on buildings, from the viewpoint of establishing test parameters for <b>watertightness</b> testing.

40|$|Curtain wall systems {{typically}} rely {{on pressure}} equalization {{to achieve a}} good <b>watertightness.</b> The insulating glass unit is clamped to the mullion between two gaskets, functioning as a rain screen and airtightness layer. When the curtain wall system is subjected to wind driven rain and a pressure difference, water may penetrate past the first gasket into the drained cavity.

In this paper, the <b>watertightness</b> and drainage of water in curtain wall systems is investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCLs) {{are mainly}} {{used to provide}} <b>watertightness</b> for soils.

Sliding resistance characteristics of the GCL system can be quantified via the so-called “inclined board” apparatus, then taken into account in a set-in-place operation. This highlights the importance of careful experimentation and representation of interacting parameters. The present study simulates a GCL system failure by means of the inclined board test.
