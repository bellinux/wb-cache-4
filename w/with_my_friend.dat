We were talking about how you sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E

The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. I said, I rather chuse to dye there <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend,</b> than to part from her.

Rear-Admiral John Wilson, a former captain of the ship, stated in {{a meeting of the}} Royal United Services Institute discussing the most acceptable types of battleship in 1884, [...] "I also agree <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> Captain Colomb that we have no type of ship to my fancy equal to the [...] or the good old Thunderer. Give me the Thunderer, the hull of the Thunderer; she had bad engines, she was not arranged as I would like inside, she was badly gunned as we all know, and she had not enough light gun or sufficient armaments; but she carried [...] of coal, could steam at 10 knots from here to the Cape, and could fight any ship of her class on the salt water." ...|$|E

I was not comfortable being away from my family for that length of time. I am sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script and I was very much looking forward to working <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend,</b> Hugh Jackman, again". Fox also decided to be [...] "in no rush" [...] to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, Jackman said the project was moving ahead. [...] "It's too early to call on Japan, I'm not sure where they're at. So now we're finding another director, but Fox is very anxious to make the movie and we're moving ahead full steam to find another director".|$|E
2500|$|The name of Florence and the Machine is {{attributed}} to Florence Welch's teenage collaboration with Isabella [...] "Machine" [...] Summers. Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, [...] "The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend,</b> who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{pitched the}} idea to French {{composer}} Claude-Michel Schönberg, and the two developed a rough synopsis. They worked up an analysis of each character's mental and emotional state, {{as well as that}} of an audience. Schönberg then began to write the music, while Boublil began work on the text. According to Boublil, [...] "...I could begin work on the words. This I did—after myself deciding on the subject and title of every song—in collaboration <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend,</b> poet Jean-Marc Natel." [...] Two years later, a two-hour demo tape with Schönberg accompanying himself on the piano and singing every role was completed. An album of this collaboration was recorded at CTS Studios in Wembley and was released in 1980, selling 260,000 copies.|$|E
