It must have been published already nine or ten years when I read it.

The visible chromosomal damage produced by exposure to metal compounds should be considered as a <b>warning</b> <b>indication</b> of potentially adverse genetic and somatic effects in humans. Today genotoxic effects of environmental agents have high priority in research related to public health. Alterations in genetic material are undoubtedly significant in the etiology of cancer and congenital malformations. Since experimental assay systems capable of revealing changes in genetic material are more sensitive, quicker, and easier to run than tests depending upon tumor formation or teratological findings in laboratory animals, increasing emphasis has recently been placed on the assessment of mutagenicity. Interaction between chemicals and genetic material results principally in two types of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alterations: first, changes in single genes at the molecular level and, second, chromosomal aberrations derived from breakage in the linear coherence of chromosomes. Another type of genetic alteration may be induced by chemicals affecting the segregation of chromosomes through interaction with the spindle fiber mechanism, the result being nondisjunction and a deviant number of chromosomes. In addition to short-term test systems, cytogenetic methods applied directly to human cells can be used to evaluate genotoxic hazards. Cytogeneti...|$|E

Monthly, medium- and short range numerical weather prediction data (NWP) are input to the European Flood Alert System for a flood event that affected rivers in Romania in October 2007. The NWP¿s consist of ensembles and deterministic forecasts of different spatial resolutions and lead times from different weather prediction models. Results are explored for the individual NWP components {{as well as for}} the ensemble. For this case study, ensembles of monthly weather forecasts contribute only marginally to the early <b>warning,</b> although some <b>indication</b> is given as early as three weeks before the event. The 15 day medium-range weather forecasts produce early flood warning information 9 - 11 days in advance. As the event draws nearer and is in range to be captured by the higher resolution ensemble forecasts, the spatial extent of the event is being forecasted with much more precision than with the medium-range. A novel post-processing method for the discharge is applied for those stations where observations are available, corrects time shifts and improves the quantitative forecasts. The paper illustrates how combination of forecasts and post-processing improves the lead time for early flood by 2 - 3 days while remaining reliable also in the short-range. JRC.
