5|$|Oxenfree is {{developer}} Night School Studio's first game. Influenced by classic teen {{movies and}} coming-of-age shows, the developers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> story-driven game without cutscenes and allowing players to freely roam the environment. The game's audiovisual presentation marries dark, organic, and analog elements with sharp, distorted, and digital ones. Oxenfree received generally positive reviews on release, with critics praising the presentation and characters, although some reviewers were left wanting more.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Defender {{prompted}} Williams to approach Vid Kidz, who originally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new game. DeMar, however, suggested creating an enhanced version of Defender to meet Williams' four-month deadline. Vid Kidz titled the game Stargate, and developed it as {{a sequel to}} Defender. It features new elements and improved the original's performance. Some home ports of Stargate were released under the title Defender II for trademark purposes.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template {{in the field of}} literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E

The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was {{developed}} by Chunsoft and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi. Chunsoft had made successful visual novels in the past, but <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new type of visual novel that could be received by a wider audience; they contacted Uchikoshi {{and asked him to}} write visual novels for them. He {{came up with the idea}} to include puzzles that are integrated within the story, and need to be solved in order for the player to make progress.|$|E
5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> PC version.|$|E

To be inducted into the Hall of Fame, inductees must have held a title belt or {{played an important role in}} or around the Missouri area between 1959 and 1983, when the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) had a strong presence in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|Ventus was {{designed}} by director Tetsuya Nomura who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> character with an important connection with the series' main character Sora. Ventus bears a strong resemblance {{to the character of}} Roxas, both of whom are voiced by Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English. After Ventus' first cameo, Nomura had to state that both of them are different characters, and the reason for such connection would be revealed in Birth by Sleep. Video game websites also commented on Ventus' first appearance, initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of Birth by Sleep, but has since been well received.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> game which {{involved}} saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as they thought it was an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E
5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Cascade Games founded in 1983 by Guy Wilhelmy and Nigel Stevens. Wilhelmy had a pilot's license and had experience with aircraft control and responsiveness, while Stevens' father had been in British Royal Air Force. Wilhelmy explained that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> fast-paced flying game with responsive graphics that other games of the time struggled with. Cascade hired programmer Ian Martin and graphics designer Damon Redmond {{to work on the}} project in 1985. The first version known as A.C.E.: Air Combat Emulator was released in 1985 for the Commodore 16 and VIC-20 home computers. Martin describes that an advertisement erroneously promising a Plus/4 version forced them to develop it under threat of action by Advertising Standards Agency.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game Adventure and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> similar game in Swedish. The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play; as they found it more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also created the story concept and main character designs. Nomura <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> darker Final Fantasy title unsuitable {{for the main}} series. The initial development went slowly, and by 2007 {{the scale of the}} project generated discussions about rebranding the game as the next main entry in the series. Production on Versus XIII ended in 2012, when it was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and transferred over to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 3 version, which was originally built using the company's proprietary Crystal Tools game engine, was abandoned due to concerns about the platform's shortening life cycle. Its engine was changed to Luminous Studio, Square Enix's custom-built engine for eighth-generation gaming hardware.|$|E
5|$|The twelve-minute sketch {{was written}} by Michael O'Donoghue who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> scene that would {{showcase}} the acting talents of John Belushi. O'Donoghue {{had been the one}} who had initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program. O'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run, but had become much more successful during syndication. Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk. He demonstrated his intense desire to get the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk's facial appearance in the original series. They worked together on the sketch for thirty-days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the show when it would be hosted by Elliott Gould.|$|E

5|$|While Evolve carried some game {{mechanics}} from Left 4 Dead, {{others were}} discarded. The team originally {{thought that it}} could be added to the artificial intelligence system of Evolves wildlife, but was later scrapped. They thought that the core experience offered by Evolve should be tracking and hunting the monster, instead of getting attacked by wildlife constantly. The team also thought that it would become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife. The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed all the time, and introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to global}} demand and the {{development}} staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to XIII. The game tackles {{the question of whether}} Lightning is happy after the events of XIII. Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> truly happy ending for the character. Lightning's outfit in XIII-2 was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a science fiction-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the valkyries of Norse mythology. The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege was {{the first}} title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded by in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 {{real-time}} strategy game Total Annihilation. Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. Taylor also served {{as one of the}} designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the lead story and dialogue writer. The music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total Annihilation. Gas Powered Games concentrated on making a role-playing game that was stripped of the typical genre elements they found slow or frustrating, to keep the player focused on the action. Development took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two; completing the game within even four years required the team to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the time.|$|E
