Given a query string (e. g., a search key), {{we want to}} find those messages that approximately contain the query, i. e., certain inserts, deletes and mismatches are allowed when matching the query with a word (or phrase) in the messages. Our approach is to store the messages sequentially in a database and hash their “fingerprints ” into a number of “fingerprint files. ” When the query is given, its fingerprints are also hashed into the files and a histogram of votes is constructed on the messages. We derive a lower bound, based on which one can prune a large number of nonqualifying messages (i. e., those whose votes are below the lower bound) during searching. The paper presents some experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the index structure and the lower bound. I...|$|E
40|$|Ranked result lists with query-dependent snippets {{have become}} {{state of the}} art in text search. They are {{typically}} implemented by searching, at query time, for occurrences of the query words in the top-ranked documents. This document-based approach has three inherent problems: (i) when a document is indexed by terms which it does not contain literally (e. g., related <b>words</b> <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> variants), localization of the corresponding snippets becomes problematic; (ii) each query operator (e. g., phrase or proximity search) has to be implemented twice, on the index side in order to compute the correct result set, and on the snippet generation side to generate the appropriate snippets; and (iii) in a worst case, the whole document needs to be scanned for occurrences of the query words, which is problematic for very long documents. We present a new index-based method that localizes snippets by information solely computed from the index, and that overcomes all three problems. Unlike previous index-based methods, we show how to achieve this at essentially no extra cost in query processing time, by a technique we call query rotation. We also show how our index-based method allows the caching of individual segments instead of complete documents, which enables a significantly larger cache hit ratio as compared to the document-based approach. We have fully integrated our implementation with the CompleteSearch engine...|$|E

30|$|Case {{studies of}} two {{children}} with spelling difficulty are reported. LK was multilingual and ED bilingual. A training programme that targeted phonic decoding (<b>or</b> sublexical) <b>spelling</b> processes was conducted with both children. Immediate and delayed post-training assessments showed improvement in spelling nonwords for LK but not for ED. Training that targeted whole <b>word</b> (<b>or</b> lexical) <b>spelling</b> processes was then conducted with ED. Improvement in spelling of irregular words (a marker for lexical spelling processes) was observed. Research into literacy difficulties with multilingual children is sparse, although multilingualism is increasingly widespread. Up to now theoretically based training {{studies have focused on}} monolingual children and results were promising. The present findings indicate that theoretically based training programmes for literacy difficulties can also be effective for multilingual children.|$|R

Phonetic-spelling was very accurate with error rates on a 5 K task approaching zero. Most importantly, multiple input strategies can be used simultaneously with only a modest degradation in performance compared to allowing only a single input strategy.

40|$|The logopenic {{variant of}} primary {{progressive}} aphasia (lvPPA) {{has been associated}} with impaired phonological short-term memory (STM; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2008). In contrast, people with mild Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) are thought to not have impaired phonological STM. Therefore, one would predict that people with lvPPA would score significantly lower than a matched AD group on tasks that require phonological STM, but not on tasks that require visuospatial STM. We tested this prediction in the current study. For tasks that are not widely available, the lvPPA group was also compared to unimpaired participants. 	Subjects. The lvPPA group consisted of 11 participants who were diagnosed based on the currently accepted criteria (Gorno-Tempini et al, 2011). The AD group consisted of 12 participants who were matched with the lvPPA group on age (lvPPA: M = 70. 7, SD = 8. 3; AD: M = 69. 7, SD = 9. 3), education (lvPPA: M = 17. 3, SD = 1. 6; AD: M = 17. 0, SD = 1. 9), and MMSE (lvPPA: M = 22. 1, SD = 3. 8; AD: M = 22. 4, SD = 2. 0). The unimpaired control group consisted of 16 participants who were matched on age (M = 71. 2, SD = 9. 6) and education (M = 17. 6, SD = 1. 5). A few participants from each group did not complete every task. 	Procedure. Participants with lvPPA and AD completed tasks requiring phonological STM: digit span, BDAE repetition subtests, pseudoword repetition, and reading and spelling of pseudowords and matched real words. They also completed tasks requiring visuospatial STM: spatial span and block design. The control participants completed the pseudoword and matched real word tasks. 	Results. The Mann-Whitney U Test was utilized for group comparisons. The lvPPA group scored significantly lower than the AD group on word repetition (p. 05). 	The lvPPA group scored significantly lower on pseudoword repetition, compared to both the AD group (p <. 05) and the controls (p <. 01). For the reading and spelling tasks, difference scores were calculated by subtracting each participant’s <b>word</b> reading <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> score from his or her pseudoword reading <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> score (see Figure 1). Compared to the AD and control groups, the lvPPA group had a greater difference score for both tasks (lvPPA vs. AD: both p’s <. 05; lvPPA vs. Controls, Reading: p <. 05; Spelling: p <. 01). 	These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phonological STM is impaired in lvPPA. The logopenic participants were more impaired than the AD group on multiple tests requiring phonological STM. In contrast, there were no differences between these groups on tests requiring visuospatial STM...|$|R

5000|$|An agglutinative {{language}} {{is a type of}} synthetic language with morphology that primarily uses agglutination: words may contain different morphemes to determine their meaning, but each of these morphemes (including stems and affixes) remains in every aspect unchanged after their union, thus resulting in generally more easily deducible word meanings if compared to fusional languages, which allow modifications in either or both the phonetics <b>or</b> <b>spelling</b> of one <b>or</b> more morphemes within a word, usually shortening the <b>word</b> <b>or</b> providing easier pronunciation.

40|$|The paper aims {{to present}} an {{approach}} to HPSG phonology which would account for underlying forms of particular phonemes. Phonology in HPSG is largely an undeveloped field, and probably the most significant attempt to expand the value of PHON (in most syntax- and morphology-related papers typically presented as a string equivalent to the <b>word’s</b> pronunciation <b>or</b> orthographic <b>spelling)</b> was undertaken by Steven Bird (Bird 1994, Bird 1995). The framework he proposed expanded PHON into an actual phonological description and allowed formulating constraints determining the well-formedness of surface representations. His approach was based around the principles of COMPOSITIONALITY and a requirement that a framework be MONOSTRATAL (Bird 1995, 1. 4. 5). The latter meant, in simplified terms, that any phonological representation has only one level, corresponding to forms actually appearing in the surface representations, and no abstract representation is stored. Although such an approach {{would seem to be}} desirable in a computational framework, the phonological phenomena in various languages cannot be adequately described without a further reference to an underlying representation of a phoneme (Shoun 2005, 4. 4.). Abby Shoun points out the issue in her study, citing eg. problems arising when representing consonants in Bengali, but does not develop an actual implementation of reference to underlying forms in HPSG phonology- which is the aim of this paper...|$|R
