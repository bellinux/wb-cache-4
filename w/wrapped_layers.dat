40|$|In this paper, new {{information}} on {{physical and chemical}} properties of the widely used nanostructured Halloysite mineral are reported. Given that the Halloysite has a tubular structure formed by a variable number of <b>wrapped</b> <b>layers</b> containing Si-OH and Al-OH groups, their proton binding affinity was measured at different ionic strengths and ionic media by means of potentiometric measurements in heterogeneous phase. One protonation constant for the Si-OH groups and two for the Al-OH groups were determined. The protonation constant values increase with increasing of the ionic strength in all the ionic media. This suggests that the presence of a background electrolyte stabilizes the protonated species through the formation of weak complexes between ions of the supporting electrolytes and the protonated species. Ten weak species were determined with different stoichiometry. It was shown that the interactions do not depend {{on the nature of the}} supporting electrolytes but on the charge. The surface charge of Halloysite was estimated by ζ potential measurements as a function of pH, and the values obtained are consistent with the nanotubes ionization predicted by using the protonation constants for the Si-OH and Al-OH groups. The total solubility of the Halloysite nanotubes, was also determined in NaCl aqueous solution. These measurements showed that the solubility slightly increases with increasing ionic strength and contact time between Halloysite and NaCl solution. Goodness-of-fit (GOF) criteria were used to test the application of these models with good results. The obtained results confirm that the behavior of Halloysite in water is strictly correlated to the experimental conditions of the aqueous suspension (e. g., pH, ionic strength, and ionic media). The thermodynamic data here reported are of main importance in the several applications where is exploited the charge separation between the inner and outer surfaces of this nanotubular material...|$|E
40|$|A new and facile {{approach}} for the surface modification of high-voltage LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 cathode active materials is demonstrated. This strategy {{is based on}} polyimide (PI) gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) -directed nanoscale wrapping. The PI coating <b>layer</b> successfully <b>wraps</b> a large area of the LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 surface via thermal imidization of (pyromellitic dianhydride/ oxydianiline) polyamic acid. Salient features of the PI <b>wrapping</b> <b>layer</b> are the highly-continuous surface coverage with nanometer thickness (~ 10 nm) and the facile ion transport through the nanoscale PI layer. Based on a sound understanding of the nanoarchitectured PI <b>wrapping</b> <b>layer,</b> its influence on the cell performance and thermal stability of high-voltage LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 is investigated {{as a function of}} charge cut-off voltage (herein, 4. 6 and 4. 8 V). The anomalous PI <b>wrapping</b> <b>layer</b> substantially improves the high-voltage cycling performance and alleviates the interfacial exothermic reaction between delithiated LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 and liquid electrolyte.

This strategy is based on nanoarchitectured polyimide (PI) gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) coating. The PI coating <b>layer</b> successfully <b>wrapped</b> a large area of the LNMO surface via thermal imidization of 4 -component (pyromellitic dianhydride/biphenyl dianhydride/phenylenediamine/oxydianiline) polyamic acid. In comparison to conventional metal oxide-based coatings, distinctive features of the unusual PI <b>wrapping</b> <b>layer</b> are the highly continuous surface coverage with nanometre thickness (similar to 10 nm) {{and the provision of}} facile ion transport. The nanostructure-tuned PI <b>wrapping</b> <b>layer</b> served as an ion-conductive protection skin to suppress the undesired interfacial side reactions, effectively preventing the direct exposure of the LNMO surface to liquid electrolyte.

The investigations reveal that a stronger electromagnetic field can be generated at the narrowed gap of the h-BN surface, which results in higher Raman sensitivity. Moreover, the h-BN-wrapped Au substrate shows extraordinary stability against photothermal and oxidative damages. We also describe its capability to detect specific chemicals that are difficult to analyze using conventional SERS substrates.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} popularity of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) members, {{there will be more}} chances of vehicles/vessels or terrorist attacks on these structures in near future. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening can be an effective option to reduce impact damage or failure of CFST members. However, existing knowledge is very limited in understanding the behaviour of FRP strengthened CFST structures under lateral impact loading. This paper outlines drop hammer impact test results of a series of experimental programs of bare and FRP strengthened CFST specimens. A total of sixteen CFST specimens were prepared and tested under lateral impact at their mid-span. The results indicate that permanent lateral displacement of CFST members can be reduced up to 18. 2 % by externally bonded FRP sheets. The effects of FRP type, FRP wrapping direction, carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) <b>wrapping</b> <b>layers,</b> <b>wrapping</b> length, and impact velocity were investigated to understand the influences of these parameters on the behaviour of strengthened CFST specimens. CFRP laminates were found to be weak under impact loading when wrapped in only longitudinal direction.
