500|$|Reuters {{reported}} that Tsakalotos was considering not {{running in the}} September 2015 legislative election, as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> implement the bailout agreement. However, these fears were assuaged by Alexis Tsipras when {{he said there was}} no doubt that Tsakalotos would stand in the election. He also claimed that, during the election campaign, without Tsakalotos' involvement, {{there would have been no}} bailout package. In recognition of that, Tsakalotos was made to head the list for Syriza in Athens B. In an interview during the campaign, Tsakalotos admitted that the Greek government had suffered [...] "defeat" [...] during negotiations with creditors, implying that some responsibility for this lay with his predecessor, Varoufakis.|$|E
500|$|The wooden {{uprights}} {{between the}} wings of the Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified Pratt truss, a bridge-building design he used for his biplane glider (initially built as a triplane). The Wrights mounted the horizontal elevator in front of the wings rather than behind, apparently believing this feature would help to avoid, or protect them, from a nosedive and crash like the one that killed Lilienthal. [...] Wilbur incorrectly believed a tail was not necessary, and their first two gliders did not have one. According to some Wright biographers, Wilbur probably did all the gliding until 1902, perhaps to exercise his authority as older brother and to protect Orville from harm as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> explain to Bishop Wright if Orville got injured.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of his contemporaries, Simpson was open about the use of drugs in professional cycling. In 1960, interviewed by Chris Brasher for The Observer newspaper, Simpson spoke about his understanding of how riders could beat him, saying: [...] "I know from the way they ride the next day they are taking dope. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take it– I have too much respect for my body." [...] Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, The People, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked about drugs by Eamonn Andrews on the BBC Home Service radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might get to the top but would not stay there.|$|E

In both situations, the Federal Government sought to promote retraining for displaced workers, to undertake watershed assessment and restoration work, and to assist communities with economic planning, grants, and transitions. Both of these efforts point out the inherent conflicts between the economic and ecological objectives of watershed restoration.

500|$|Two props of the Orb were made. One of {{the prop}} Orbs {{was used for}} stunts and had {{retractable}} rods. A second version was manufactured from cast bronze, making it heavy: [...] "You really didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> handle it", Campbell said. The rocket car seen in the pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator Kam Cooney and was a working vehicle with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls. Some items used in the show had been repurposed from older productions, and some would later be used in other shows. For example, the steam locomotive seen in the pilot episode {{was the same as}} the one used in Back to the Future Part III. Two of Carry's prop guns– rifles whose barrels were sawed-off in fashion of the Mare's Leg– were later reused in the science fiction television series Firefly.|$|E
500|$|The {{morning of}} the operation, General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the {{professional}} head of the British Armed Forces—was coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost, a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost. The first public knowledge of Operation Barras came from Guthrie's interview with Frost, which took place while the operation was still concluding. Guthrie told Frost [...] "e didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> assault, because it's a very difficult operation, there are big risks in it but we have done it [...] because our negotiations were getting nowhere. The hostages had been there [...] for three weeks, they [...] were threatening to kill them, or they were threatening to move them {{to other parts of}} Sierra Leone and once they'd done that we'd never be able to recover [...] with ease, which I hope we've done this morning".

500|$|Petr Harmáček (known online by the alias [...] "Harmy") {{had watched}} a dubbed {{version of the}} {{original}} cut of Star Wars {{at the age of}} six, and had then seen the Special Editions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on their 1997 release. Although initially admiring them, he became disappointed when he learnt how much the films had been changed retroactively; he argued that replacing the original effects with re-composited digital effects was [...] "an act of cultural vandalism". A fan of the original trilogy, he had written his undergraduate thesis on their cultural impact. After seeing a trailer for Adywan's cut of The Empire Strikes Back, Harmáček was inspired to create a version of the film that [...] "undid" [...] the post-1977 changes and restored the theatrical releases in high-definition. He described his motivation as: [...] "I {{wanted to be able to}} show people who haven't seen Star Wars yet, like my little brother or my girlfriend, the original, Oscar-winning version, but I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> show it to them in bad quality."

500|$|For the session, {{which was}} booked for two hours, Wood and Joe Boyd {{operated}} the mixing desk, while Whitehead and Stern were filming. This {{recording of the}} song lasted nearly 16-minutes in length, recorded onto a 4-track recorder in one take, as the band didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play through the song again. The band then played another original instrumental, titled [...] "Nick's Boogie". While 5 seconds of the band playing was included in Whitehead's Tonite Lets All Make Love in London film, edits of the recording was included on the film's respective soundtrack. The soundtrack (released in 1968) includes an edited version of the song and two reprises of it. The full version {{is available on the}} album London '66–'67. While attempting to get the band a record deal, Boyd returned with the group to Sound Techniques studios. There, Boyd and the band recorded a demo tape which was to be given to various record labels, one of the songs that features on the tape was [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". An early, unoverdubbed, shortened mix of the album's [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] was used for a French EP released in July 1967. The 40th anniversary edition of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn contains two different, five-minute-long versions of the song, one of them being take 6 from 16 March.|$|E
500|$|After {{the strike}} force was recovered, {{much of the}} Home Fleet sailed away from the Norwegian coast to refuel. A group {{comprising}} Formidable, Furious, two cruisers and several destroyers set a course for the two fleet oilers, and the escort carrier group withdrew so that the carriers could refuel their escorts. At 5:25 pm, Nabob {{was struck by a}} torpedo fired from U-354. The carrier suffered serious damage and 21 fatalities but was able to continue limited flight operations. Shortly afterwards U-354 torpedoed the frigate [...] as the latter searched for Nabobs attacker. Nabob was forced to return to the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow that evening, escorted by Trumpeter, a cruiser and several destroyers. Formidable and Furious covered their withdrawal; during this period Furious also refuelled from the Home Fleet's tankers. The departure of both escort carriers meant that the mine-dropping component of Operation Goodwood had to be cancelled. Bickertons stern was wrecked by the torpedo, and she could have potentially been salvaged. However, the force's commander did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> protect two crippled ships, and the frigate was scuttled at around 8:30 pm on 22 August. Shortly after the attacks on Nabob and Bickerton, Seafires from 894 Naval Air Squadron shot down two German Blohm & Voss BV 138 reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E

Kobach complained that he was being discriminated against because former Republican Governor Bill Graves received a much smaller fine for similar violations. Kobach alleged, [...] "The only real distinction I can see is that I'm a conservative and he's a moderate." [...] The chair of the Kansas ethics commission said [...] "The commission does not condone lack of candor before the commission."

2500|$|Until mid-March 1939, Germany had {{considered}} that [...] "for military reasons a common Hungarian-Polish frontier was undesirable". [...] Indeed, Hitler had warned Hungary {{not to touch}} the remainder of Slovakia, when he authorized Hungary to occupy the rest of Carpathorus in March 1939. He meant to use Slovakia as a staging ground for his planned invasion of Poland. In March 1939 Hitler {{changed his mind about}} the common Hungarian-Polish frontier, and decided to betray Germany's ally, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, who had already in 1938 begun organizing Ukrainian military units in a sich outside Uzhhorod under German tutelage. Polish political and military authorities saw the sich as a real and present danger to nearby southeastern Poland, with its largely Ukrainian population. Hitler, however, was concerned that if a Ukrainian army organized in Rus were to accompany German forces invading the Soviet Union, Ukrainian nationalists would insist on the establishment of an independent Ukraine; Hitler, who had plans for the natural and farming resources of Ukraine, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with an independent Ukrainian government.|$|E
