5|$|Rutherford was {{succeeded by}} Nathan Homer Knorr as {{president}} of the <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford began {{a career}} in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He {{developed}} {{an interest in the}} doctrines of <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.|$|E
5|$|By 1916 Rutherford {{had become}} one of the seven {{directors}} of the <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society; when Russell died on October 31, 1916 he joined vice-President Alfred I. Ritchie and Secretary-Treasurer William E. Van Amburgh on a three-man executive committee that ran the Pennsylvania corporation until a new president was elected at the annual general meeting the following January. He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run The <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> from the December 15, 1916 issue. Russell's will, drawn up in 1907, had named the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death; Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Watch</b> <b>towers</b> are {{observation}} towers, {{on which}} persons supervise a larger area. Strictly speaking, control towers also {{fall into this}} category, although surveillance from these structures is mostly done in a non-optical way using Radar. <b>Watch</b> <b>towers</b> usually have a closed pulpit to protect the observer against bad weather. <b>Watch</b> <b>towers</b> {{do not have an}} elevator as a rule, since these buildings are mostly not higher than 20 metres. Active <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> are not as a rule accessible to the public, since they usually serve for the monitoring of sensitive ranges. However <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> can be quite ordered for forest fire monitoring a platform accessible for the public or be used during times without forest fire risk as observation <b>towers.</b> Shut down <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> can however be easily converted to observation towers.|$|R

50|$|For {{visitors}} {{there are}} a number of <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> to observe wild life. While Kochilaberana, Pitagadia and Charichhak <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> are excellent for observation of birds and animals, the ones at Kumarkhunti and Ambilo have the comfort of rest houses where one can make a night halt.|$|R
5|$|However, after 1912 {{he became}} more radical and began to {{predicted}} the liberation of the Africans {{and the end of}} colonial rule, and began to foster closer links with a number of other independent African churches. From 1914, he preached more militant sermons, often referring to Old Testament themes, concentrating on such aspects as the Israelites' escape from slavery in Egypt , Chilembwe himself {{was not part of the}} apocalyptic <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> movement, which was popular in central Africa at the time and later became known as Kitawala in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but some of his followers may have been influenced by it. The leader of <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower,</b> Charles Taze Russell had predicted that Armageddon would begin in October 1914, which some of Chilembwe’s followers equated to an end to colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a <b>watch</b> <b>tower</b> over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Rutherford {{published}} a systematic reinterpretation {{of the book}} of Revelation. Many of the symbols recorded in the book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928. These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views as well as the historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.|$|E
50|$|Piatra Roşie, {{which means}} Red Rock, was a Dacian hill fort two days {{march to the}} west from Costeşti-Cetăţuie fortress, at Luncani in Boşorod municipality. It was built in two phases. In the first phase a long (102 m) {{rectangular}} main citadel was built {{at the height of}} land with <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> on each end and two outlying <b>watch</b> <b>towers.</b> Later the larger area inside the <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> was enclosed with walls. It appears that the hilltop was flattened in the process in order to produce a usable space.|$|R

5|$|On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, {{was elected}} {{president}} of the <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the president would be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{expanded}} his means of spreading the <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> message in 1924 with {{the start of}} 15-minute radio broadcasts, initially from WBBR, based on Staten Island, and eventually via a network {{of as many as}} 480 radio stations. A 1931 talk was broadcast throughout North America, Australia and France, but his attacks on the clergy resulted in both the NBC and BBC radio networks banning his broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford married Mary Malcolm Fetzer of Boonville, Missouri on December 31, 1891. Their only child, Malcolm Cleveland, {{was born}} on November 10, 1892. The couple {{separated}} after Joseph Rutherford {{became president of the}} <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society. Mary remained {{an active member of the}} Jehovah's Witnesses until becoming confined to her home in the years before her death in 1962 at age 93.|$|E

5|$|The Calais Lighthouse (Le phare de Calais) {{was built}} in 1848, {{replacing}} the old <b>watch</b> <b>tower</b> as the lighthouse of the port. The 55 metre high tower was electrified in 1883 and automated in 1992. The staircase has 271 steps {{leading up to the}} lantern. By day it is easily distinguishable from other coastal lighthouses by its white color and black lantern. The lighthouse was classified as a historical monument on 22 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Fort Senneville {{is one of}} the {{outlying}} forts of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, built by the Canadiens of New France near the Sainte-Anne rapids in 1671. The property was part of a fief ceded to Dugué de Boisbriant in 1672 by the Sulpicians. A large stone windmill, which doubled as a <b>watch</b> <b>tower,</b> was built on a hill by late 1686 and featuring machicolation and other castle-like features. The fort was burned down by Iroquois in 1691, with only the mill itself left standing.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{external}} work was complete {{by the end of}} 1879. The result closely followed Burges's original plans, with the exception of an additional <b>watch</b> <b>tower</b> intended to resemble a minaret, and some defensive timber hoardings, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the drawbridge and portcullis, against surviving designs at other British castles.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{buildings}} {{in the area of}} the town date back to the time of the Order of Saint John. The Knights built two <b>Watch</b> <b>Towers</b> on the extreme ends of the current Pembroke coast. The first of these is Saint George's Tower, which was built in 1638 as part of a series of coastal <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> financed by Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris. The second tower, Madliena Tower, forms part of a network of 13 coastal <b>watch</b> <b>towers,</b> collectively known as the De Redin towers, which were built between 1658 and 1659 during the reign of Grand Master Martin de Redin to protect the then uninhabited northern coast of Malta. These 13 towers adorn the official flag and emblem of Pembroke, reflecting the town's military heritage.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> {{and other}} {{facilities}} provided and maintained by forest department. There is park nearby with a play area and guest house.|$|R
25|$|These {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of the later 15th and 16th century. In some stadt, tall and {{impressive}} <b>watch</b> <b>towers</b> were built either in or adjacent to the market place. A watchman would be employed continuously to survey the town walls and the surrounding countryside. Churches and the tall towers of the defences could also be permanent <b>watch</b> <b>towers.</b> Examples of these watchtowers are at Enns, 1554–68; Retz, where the tower is adjacent to the Rathaus; and Innsbruck of 1358.|$|R
5|$|By June, four of {{the seven}} <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society directors—Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright— had decided they had erred in {{endorsing}} Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic. In June, Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the board's authority from the president. Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society. The <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Society's official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted directors confirmed that given to Rutherford; however, the pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford's. On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned Rutherford to office.|$|E
5|$|Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian {{denomination}} {{whose members}} refuse {{to engage in}} any political or national practices, such as saluting the flag or performing national service. This was deemed prejudicial to the public welfare and good order of Singapore, and on 14 January 1972 the Government issued two orders {{to deal with the}} perceived threat to public order. First, Gazette Notification No. 123 of 1972 ("Order 123") was issued by the Minister for Culture pursuant to section 3 of the Undesirable Publications Act ("UPA") to ban works published by the <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Bible and Tract Society ("WTBTS"), the primary corporation used by Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a <b>watch</b> <b>tower,</b> who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a <b>watch</b> <b>tower,</b> and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

5|$|In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994), the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses by Order No. 179/1972 made {{pursuant}} to section 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act. This provision {{allows for the}} dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to public peace, welfare or good order. The Minister had also made Order No. 123/1972 and Order No. 405/1994 {{pursuant to}} section 3(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act, prohibiting publications by the <b>Watch</b> <b>Tower</b> Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications. They appealed and sought to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} Minister's prohibition order and the deregistration of the Jehovah's Witnesses, arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} or post-medieval period, {{the remains of}} the hillfort were used as a rabbit warren which was used to breed rabbits, {{providing}} valuable meat and fur. Many warrens were surrounded by banks or walls to prevent the rabbits from escaping; escaped rabbits caused damage to nearby farmland and meant a loss in profit. The warren at Dolebury is completely enclosed by the substantial ramparts of the Iron Age hill fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed rabbits. The presence of pillow mounds and vermin traps demonstrate man's management of the site for husbandry. Ridge and furrow agriculture has also been identified, from aerial photographs, within the fort. Some of these structures, along with earlier Iron Age features, have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for lead, ochre or calamine. The site was described by John Leland in the 16th century. A three-storey building, believed to be the warrener's house and possibly a <b>watch</b> <b>tower,</b> surrounded by a garden, was in ruins by 1830.|$|E
5|$|The Tour du Guet (<b>Watch</b> <b>Tower),</b> {{situated}} in Calais Nord on the Places d'Armes, {{is one of}} the few surviving pre-war buildings. Dating from 1229, when Philip I, Count of Boulogne, built the fortifications of Calais, it {{is one of the}} oldest monuments of Calais, although the oldest remaining traces date to 1302. It has a height of 35–39 metres (sources differ). An earthquake in 1580 split the tower in two, and at one time it threatened to collapse completely. The tower was repaired in 1606, and then had the purpose of serving as a hall to accommodate the merchants of Calais. It was damaged in 1658 when a young stable boy set fire to it, while it was temporarily being used as royal stables during a visit of King Louis XIV. It was not repaired for some 30 years. In 1770, a bell identical to the original bell of 1348 was cast. Due to its height, from the late 17th century it became an important watchout post for the city for centuries until 1905; the last keeper of the tower was forced to leave in 1926. Abraham Chappe, (a brother of Ignace Chappe) installed a telegraph office in the tower in 1816 and operated for 32 years. It was this office which announced the death of Napoleon I to the French public in 1821. It also had the dual function as lighthouse with a rotating beacon fuelled by oil from 1818. The lantern was finally replaced by a new lighthouse on 15 October 1848. During the First World War, it served as a military observation post and narrowly missed destruction during World War II. This tower has been classified as a historic monument since 6 November 1931.|$|E
