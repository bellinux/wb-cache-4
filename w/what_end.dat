500|$|Inevitably the rebels' 'king' was found. Walsingham and Capgrave {{agree that}} after Geoffrey Litster's capture, {{he was taken}} to North Walsham and was there drawn, hung and quartered. According to Capgrave's chronicle, [...] "The traitor was sought and found; he was {{captured}} and beheaded; and, divided into four parts, he was sent through the country to Norwich, Yarmouth, and Lynn, and to the site of his mansion; that rebels and insurgents against the peace might learn by <b>what</b> <b>end</b> they will finish their career". Walsingham wrote an account of the mercy shown by the bishop to Litster during his execution: [...] "After hearing his confession and absolving him by virtue of his office, he followed him to the gallows, showing, although he had overcome him, a deed of kindness and piety, for he supported his head lest it should be bruised by the ground when he was being drawn to the hanging".|$|E
500|$|In March 1599, Devereux {{was sent}} to defeat the growing {{rebellion}} in Ireland and was given command of 18,000men, but by November his army was reduced to 4,000, the rest [...] "frittered away" [...] in exchange for [...] " [...] nothing". On 5 June 1600 he faced a panel of Privy Councillors, judges {{and members of the}} nobility at York House, where he was charged with appointing generals without the Queen's permission, ignoring orders and negotiating [...] "very basely" [...] with the leader of the rebel forces. While the members of the nobility wished to be gentle with Devereux, the lawyers and judges felt differently, recommending fines and confinement in the Tower of London. In the end a compromise was reached, with Devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices. Devereux immediately began plotting rebellion. Orders were sent out for [...] "bedding" [...] and [...] "draperies"– codenames for weapons– and rebellious gentlemen gathered at Essex House to hear him talk of Elizabeth's [...] "crooked mind and crooked carcass". In response, Coke and Cecil began a counter-plot. In 1599 Sir John Hayward had written and published The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IV, dedicating it to Devereux. Elizabeth, furious, had banned the book, suggesting that it was a [...] "seditious prelude" [...] intended to show her as a corrupt and poor monarch. Against the backdrop of Devereux's plot, Coke and Cecil started a new investigation into the book, hoping to prove some involvement of Devereux in the publishing. Coke interviewed Hayward's licensing cleric, Samuel Harsnett, who complained that the dedication had been [...] "foisted" [...] on him by Devereux. In reaction, Coke decided to bring charges of treason against Devereux, saying that he had [...] "plotted and practised with the Pope and king of Spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of England... His permitting underhand that treasonable book of Henry IV to be printed and published; it being plainly deciphered, not only by the matter, and by the epistle itself, for <b>what</b> <b>end</b> and for whose behalf it was made, but also the Earl himself being present so often at the playing thereof, and with great applause giving countenance to it".|$|E

2500|$|In the Holy Land, Philip {{hoped to}} take part in a planned {{invasion}} of Egypt, for which purpose the crusaders had allied with the Byzantine Empire. A Byzantine fleet of 150 galleys was waiting at Acre when Philip arrived on 2 August. Philip had other plans, however. He and King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem were first cousins, sharing a grandfather, King Fulk, whose daughter from his first marriage, Sibylla of Anjou, was Philip's mother. Baldwin IV was a leper and childless, and offered Philip the regency of the Kingdom of Jerusalem as his closest male relative currently present there. Philip refused both this and the command of the army of the kingdom, saying he was there only as a pilgrim. Instead Baldwin appointed Raynald of Châtillon, to whom Philip would act as an assistant. As William of Tyre says, [...] "this being the situation, the count at last revealed the secret thought of his mind and did not try to conceal to <b>what</b> <b>end</b> all his plans were." [...] He had come to have his own vassals married to his cousins, Baldwin's sister Sibylla and half-sister Isabella.|$|E
