5|$|In the Matsya Purana, Ila was disinherited after {{becoming}} a female or kimpurusha. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila stayed with him. The Ramayana says that having returned to manhood, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his son Shashabindu ruled over Bahlika. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana tells {{that as a}} man Sudyumma governed the kingdom and as a woman remained indoors. His subjects were disturbed by his sex changes and did not respect him as they once had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas {{and went to the}} forest for penance. The sage Narada told Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, Navakshara, which would please the Supreme Goddess. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul <b>with</b> <b>herself</b> and thus, Ilā gained salvation.|$|E

5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet.

25|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} have arisen from this relationship amongst independent states, ranging from minor diplomatic matters—such as the monarch expressing {{on the advice}} of one of her cabinets views that counter those of another of her cabinets—to more serious conflicts regarding matters of armed conflict, wherein the monarch, as head of state of two different realms, may be simultaneously at war and at peace with a third country, or even at war <b>with</b> <b>herself</b> as head of two hostile nations. In such cases, viceroys have tended to avoid placing the sovereign directly in the centre of the conflict, meaning that a governor-general may have to take controversial actions entirely on his or her own initiative through the exercise of the reserve powers.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa {{started out}} {{socially}} awkward, she quickly became popular with her classmates. In the manga, she once {{became president of}} her class. Her initial shyness {{could be attributed to}} {{the fact that she was}} teased in the 30th-century for not having any Soldier powers. As the manga progresses, she gradually matures, becoming more comfortable <b>with</b> <b>herself</b> and more confident with her Soldier abilities. Because her dream in the manga is to become a beautiful lady, her actions often are based around this. She tries to be a perfectionist and starts off trying to do everything alone and for herself. This view evolves as she realizes what maturity really is and what it really means to be an adult. In the original anime, she is more judgmental and does not mature as much as her manga counterpart.

500|$|... "So Happy I Could Die" [...] is a mid-tempo Europop song, {{which is}} filled with Auto-Tune, giving it an echoing effect. According to the music sheet {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing on the website Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of A3 to A4 and the song follows a basic sequence of F–G–Em–Am as its chord progression. As Gaga sings the chorus, its melodic structure emulates that of Natasha Bedingfield's [...] "Pocketful of Sunshine" [...] (2008). Paul Lester of BBC suggested that [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] is reflective of the LGBT themes common in Gaga's songs, while Slant Magazine journalist Sal Cinquemani asserted that it telegraphed the [...] "instructive" [...] execution of the singer's rejection of [...] "any and all intimacy with others". [...] "'So Happy I Could Die' is a love song," [...] he remarked, [...] "but the object of her affection is herself—looking at herself, drinking <b>with</b> <b>herself,</b> dancing <b>with</b> <b>herself,</b> touching herself." ...|$|E

This is musically effected by Björk's vocals as she sings the lyric [...] "All is full of love" [...] in counterpoint <b>with</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
