40|$|Abstract. A {{function}} u on {{the unit}} circle T is said to <b>be</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in the weighted space Lp(T, w) if ‖u+ f‖Lp(T,w) ≥ ‖u‖Lp(T,w) for all f ∈ H∞. We prove that if an unimodular function u <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) and some non-zero weight w, then u is an inner function. We describe the inner functions Θ and the weights w {{on the unit}} circle T such that Θ <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p> 0. It turns out that, for given inner functions Θ, the class of all weights satisfying the above-mentioned condition depends only on the zero set of Θ. In other words, Θ <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) {{if and only if}} B <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞), where B is a Blaschke product with simple zeros and such that Θ− 1 (0) = B− 1 (0) ...|$|R

5|$|HMS Garland, {{also known}} by her Polish {{designation}} ORP Garland, was a G-class destroyer {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Shortly after World War II began, she <b>was</b> <b>badly</b> damaged by the premature explosion of her own depth charges and required over six months of repairs. Before these were completed, Garland was loaned to the Polish Navy in May 1940. The ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet afterwards and escorted convoys there before being assigned to the Western Approaches Command in September for escort duties. She escorted a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta during Operation Halberd in September 1941 and escorted Convoy PQ-16 from Iceland to Murmansk in May 1942. She <b>was</b> <b>badly</b> damaged by a near miss from a German bomber during that operation and required three months of repairs.|$|E
