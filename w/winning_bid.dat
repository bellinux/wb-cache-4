40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{stochastic}} {{properties of the}} first price and second price <b>winning</b> <b>bids</b> in auctions with risk neutral bidders with independent and identically distributed valuations. In such an environment, the <b>winning</b> first price <b>bids</b> second order stochastically dominate the second price <b>winning</b> <b>bids.</b> A key result {{of this paper is}} that the ratio of the variance of the <b>winning</b> first price <b>bid</b> to that of the <b>winning</b> second price <b>bid</b> is strictly less than one even as the number of bidders goes to infinity. This suggests that the stochastic dominance of the <b>winning</b> first price <b>bids</b> does not vanish even in the limit. Both the asymptotic and small sample properties of <b>winning</b> <b>bids</b> are investigated. In particular, the small sample results suggest that the identification power of econometric procedures that rely on <b>winning</b> <b>bids</b> can decline rapidly as the number of bidders increases. This paper also includes a systematic evaluation of the difference in certainty equivalents between the two auction formats for several common distributions and number of bidders for the case of auctioneers with constant coefficient of absolute risk aversion. These results are presented in a form that makes it easy to apply them to a specific auction of interest.

It would resurface decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 at a flea market in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a <b>winning</b> <b>bid</b> for $155,401 was placed, but not honored.

5|$|Since about 1900, the Black Canyon {{and nearby}} Boulder Canyon had been {{investigated}} for their potential {{to support a}} dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The <b>winning</b> <b>bid</b> to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc., which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, {{and some of the}} techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.|$|E

The contract was signed on 17 December and the plans were delivered to the building yard seven days later. Texas keel was laid down on 17 April 1911 at Newport News, Virginia.

5|$|Under Sinatra, the Celebrity Room {{was added}} {{alongside}} a helipad and it opened year round. His ownership gradually {{increased over the}} following two years until he owned 50 percent outright. But Giancana's attendance at the property first provoked a rift between Sinatra and share holder Hank Sanicola, and later resulted in Sinatra's gambling license being suspended by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. He initially leased the property to Jack L. Warner and later in 1968 {{to a group of}} investors. It passed through the hands of a series of investment groups until 1976 when it was bought by Kirk Kerkorian. The property closed for renovations in 2013 and has not reopened since.

5|$|After {{not being}} {{selected}} to become Labour's {{candidate in the}} 2000 London mayoral election, Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the congestion charge, Oyster card, and articulated buses, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of London Underground. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was re-elected in 2004, expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's <b>winning</b> <b>bid</b> to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012, losing both to the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. In 2016, accused of bringing the party into disrepute, he was suspended from Labour.|$|E
