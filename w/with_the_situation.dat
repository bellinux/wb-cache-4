5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts had little to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{historians have}} had mostly {{negative}} assessments of Ivan Shishman. He is {{often viewed as}} having intruded onto the throne due to the intrigues {{of his mother and}} thus taking the place of the rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of the country {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, “the land of emperor Shishman”.|$|E
