5|$|The {{girls are}} soon {{captured}} by Fireflies, who restrain them; Marlene, {{the leader of}} the Fireflies, recognizes Ellie, and demands that she remain safe. When Riley claims she would like to join their group, Marlene refuses, and the two argue, resulting in Marlene threatening to shoot Riley. Ellie intervenes, demanding at gunpoint that Marlene explain how she knows information about Ellie. When Ellie finally lowers the gun, Marlene informs her that she knew Ellie's mother, and had promised her that she would take care of Ellie. Ellie hands the gun to Marlene, who says that she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> more about her mother in the future, before telling the girls to leave. When Ellie and Riley reenter the quarantine zone, Riley says that there is no escape. Ellie suggests running away, but Riley informs her that this will just result in death. The two then walk back into the school.|$|E

25|$|Nouhad was a shy {{child and}} did not have many friends at school. However, she was very {{attached}} to her grandmother who lived in Debbieh (Shuf area), where Nouhad used to spend her summer holidays. Nouhad seemed to enjoy the rural village life. During the day, Nouhad would help her grandmother with house chores and fetch fresh water from a nearby water spring. She would sing {{all the way to the}} spring and back. In the evening, Nouhad would sit by the candlelight with her grandmother, who <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> stories.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Florence,' said Walter, 'on {{this last}} night of her bearing her own name, has made me promise--it was only just now, when you left us together--that I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> you--with <b>her</b> dear love--' ...|$|R
500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry {{explained}} to Whitney {{that he wanted}} Rand to be Captain Kirk's confidante but never wanted them to express their affection for one another, instead {{he wanted it to}} be played as an ongoing undercurrent. In the early publicity photos, Whitney was dressed in the same manner that the women had been in the two pilots – a loose gold colored tunic and black trousers. She complained to Roddenberry about them hiding her [...] "dancer's legs", so he had William Ware Theiss design a short skirt and tunic for her to wear, a uniform which was adopted by the other female characters on the series. She said the outfit was [...] "sensational" [...] and that [...] "it stopped traffic". Despite the outfit being designed specifically for Whitney, Theiss was concerned and <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to lose weight. She was subsequently prescribed amphetamines by her doctor, for the purpose of weight loss. Whitney stated that this was the start of her addiction to them, and in order to come down off them at night, she began drinking in the evening to take away the [...] "edginess".|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} written by Pausini after many years the press having {{announced}} she was pregnant when actually she was not. In her words, the song represents what <b>would</b> she <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> daughter when she born.|$|R
6000|$|But Lucy was {{resolved}} that she <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> anything. [...] "I am so wretched!" [...] That {{would have been}} all; but she <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> wretchedness. [...] "We are so quiet in Kingsbury Crescent," [...] she said; [...] "you have {{so much more to}} talk of." ...|$|R
60|$|Mildred had {{suggested}} coming {{at four in}} the afternoon, and he <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that the hour was inconvenient. After all she came first. He waited for her impatiently. He watched for her at the window and opened the front-door himself.|$|R
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
2500|$|LDS {{historian}} Wayne J. Embry interviewed several black LDS Church {{members in}} 1987 {{and reported that}} all the participants reported [...] "incidents of aloofness {{on the part of}} white members, a reluctance or a refusal to shake hands with them or sit by them, and racist comments made to them." [...] Embry further reported that one black church member attended church for three years, despite being completely ignored by fellow church members. Embry reports that [...] "she [...] had to write directly {{to the president of the}} LDS Church to find out how to be baptized" [...] because none of her fellow church members <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Professional Performing Arts School, Keys was {{accepted}} to Columbia University. She dropped out after four weeks to pursue her music career. She signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and his So So Def label. Keys co-wrote and recorded a song titled [...] "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 hit film, Men in Black. She {{also contributed to the}} So So Def Christmas recordings. Keys began writing, producing and recording the album in 1998. She completed it that same year, but it was rejected by Columbia Records. Keys explained that the producers she worked with <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to [...] "just get in the booth and sing", which frustrated her. Her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys then performed for Clive Davis, who sensed a [...] "special, unique" [...] artist; he bought Keys' contract from Columbia and signed her to Arista Records, which later disbanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{only makes}} it the worse for her. She is so much out of spirits, Lionel; and if you <b>would</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that part about his schools and his lodging, I am sure she {{would be so much}} obliged to you." ...|$|R
60|$|Clara laughed strangely, and rose, {{picking the}} cowslips from her hair. She took up her hat and pinned it on. One flower had {{remained}} tangled in her hair. He saw, but <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> He {{gathered up the}} flowers he had sprinkled over her.|$|R
6000|$|... “Come, get to work, Doctor. The {{signs are}} {{favourable}} for an extensive practice this voyage. I don’t {{know what the}} Ghost would have been without you, and if I could only cherish such noble sentiments I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>her</b> master is deeply grateful.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Coretta {{transferred}} out of Antioch {{when she}} won a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. It was while studying singing at that school with Marie Sundelius that she met Martin Luther King, Jr. after mutual friend Mary Powell gave King her phone number after he asked about girls on the campus. Coretta {{was the only one}} remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met. She told him [...] "I don't see how you can say that. You don't even know me." [...] But King was assured and asked to see her again. She readily accepted his invitation to a weekend party.|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that {{you have not been}} blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that you shall be cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her once." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course Isa {{agreed to}} do so, and Lockley, turning to Eve, said he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> a story before going home.|$|E
6000|$|... "How should I {{know that}} she had told him? She <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>her</b> own story--what she herself wished. And {{whatever}} story she told, he would not believe it. They know each other better than you and I know them. It must be you, Harry, if you will do it." ...|$|R
60|$|She owned {{that she}} had loved too well, Had loved too well, unhappy she, And bore a secret time <b>would</b> <b>tell,</b> Though in <b>her</b> shroud she'd sooner be.|$|R
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} they were {{steaming}} {{out of the}} harbour for their voyage {{of four or five}} hours, at whose ending she <b>would</b> have to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> strange story.|$|R
60|$|In {{the pause}} that followed, {{he seemed to}} debate, not so much whether he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> as how to begin to tell her.|$|E
6000|$|And {{what had}} Eleanor meant when she {{declared}} that whatever she did, she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> father first? What was she thinking of doing? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{waited in}} silence, sadly, patiently. It {{was no good}} being {{impatient}} with him. At any rate, he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> now what ailed him.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} quick enough to note that, at mention of Gaston's name, his eyes {{suddenly}} wore a curious shamefaced expression and avoided meeting her own. She pressed her point more carelessly, {{feeling that there}} was something that he <b>would</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> if she was perfectly calm and natural in her questionings.|$|R
6000|$|... "When you please, and as often. Have I {{not said}} that you are light and heat to me? Can the sun rise too often for those who love it?" [...] Then she held her hand up to be kissed, and kissed his in return, and went silently down the stairs into the street. He had said once {{in the course of}} the conversation--nay, twice, as she came to {{remember}} in thinking over it--that she might do as she <b>would</b> about <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> friends; and she had been almost craftily careful to say nothing herself, and to draw nothing from him, which could be held as militating against this authority, or as subsequently negativing the permission so given. She <b>would</b> undoubtedly <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> father--and her aunt; and would as certainly demand from her uncle those documents of which Anton Trendellsohn had spoken to her.|$|R
60|$|On {{this evening}} that we speak of, {{she had made}} up her mind that she <b>would</b> try and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> husband {{some of the things that}} were passing in her mind.|$|R
60|$|It {{had come}} to her as an {{inspiration}} that if he thought she knew, or were on the edge of knowledge, he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would begin}} by asking her pardon for {{worrying}} her with my invention when I knew she disliked problematic mechanics. Then I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> in as few words as possible, that I had expected this little instrument {{to give me}} fame and fortune, and therefore I wanted her to know all about it; and then, before she could ask me why I wanted her to know this, I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> it was because I wished to lay that fame and fortune at her feet. After that, {{in the best way}} my ardent feelings should dictate, I would offer myself to her without fortune, without fame, just the plain John Howard who loved her with all his heart. If she accepted me, I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that the invention had not worked as I had intended it should, and therefore I should put it behind me forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so--it {{is what she}} {{especially}} wants not to do! But the spirit of opposition is not the thing to cause tenderness.' ...|$|E

And I really felt: “Isn’t it great to have someone like that?!” Because I never had anyone who <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me: pay attention to that, watch for that. So I’m like: “I will take on that role for her”.” [Lale, woman of Turkish origin] [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rachel {{will see}} about them; she knows." [...] Now Rachel {{was the old}} female servant of twenty years' standing; and the {{disappointment}} experienced by poor Miss Biggs at the ignorance {{in which she was}} left was greatly enhanced by a belief that Rachel knew more than she did. Mrs. Furnival <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> Rachel but <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> This was very, very hard, as Miss Biggs felt. But, nevertheless, friendship, sincere friendship is long enduring, and true patient merit will generally receive at last its appropriate reward.|$|R
6000|$|He {{hoped to}} find rest and peace beside Gilda; he <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he had {{condemned}} the man to death.
