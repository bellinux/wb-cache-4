5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I. Joe: Yearbook {{differed from the}} typical comic book annual publication in that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> magazine. Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, {{a summary of the}} comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E
5|$|Adrian Paul {{said that}} Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her {{out as a}} {{different}} character from Tessa. Paul also said that his lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, Lisa <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hostile takeover. They formed the Hands off Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few good years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E

25|$|The Joneses were {{assisted}} by many younger archaeologists and 'volunteers' from Britain and abroad {{including more than}} 3,000 students from many countries. The volunteers lived mainly in tents during the warmer months, but in the winter, occupied old caravans and sheds. The organisation of the camp, the feeding, the pay and the volunteers' welfare involved many individuals guided by terse memos signed by the initials 'muj'. Jones sometimes commented that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> holiday camp than an archaeological dig.

25|$|Despite {{being an}} Islamic Sultanate, Mataram had never adopted Islamic culture, systems and {{institutions}} thoroughly. Its political system <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> syncretism of earlier Javanese Hindu civilisation merged with Islamic elements. The major formation {{took place during}} Sultan Agung's reign as he adapted Islam to the Hindu-Javanese tradition and introduced a new calendar in 1633 based on Islamic and Javanese practice. The arts during Sultan Agung's reign were a mixture of Islamic and Hindu-Javanese elements. The mainstream belief system was the Kejawen tradition, while the Islamic beliefs was held {{by a handful of}} kiyai or ulama religious elite clustering around Kauman area near court's mosque. The Javanese court ceremonies, culture and rituals of Mataram still bears Hindu-Buddhist elements. Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan, batik, kris, wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, and inherited by its successors, the courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman.|$|E
25|$|Alfonso XI {{launched}} his expedition in August 1349, having made extensive preparations {{to ensure that}} he would not face the problems that had doomed his 1333 attempt. He raised money through three extraordinary levies, obtaining shares of ecclesiastical income granted by the Pope (who had endorsed Alfonso's campaigns as crusades), selling royal lands and having the crown jewels melted down and sold. He also had much tighter control of his nobles than in 1333, with many of the great nobles of Castile accompanying the expedition. He set up his base in the area of La Línea de la Concepción, north of Gibraltar, with an army of some 20,000 men. The Castilians made no attempt to storm Gibraltar but settled down for a long siege and dug defensive ditches across the isthmus to block Moorish attempts to break out. The camp <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> town than a temporary camp, with barracks constructed for the army. Alfonso even brought along most of his family by his mistress Leonora de Guzman – four boys and a girl – with his legitimate son Peter remaining in Seville. The siege was supported by primitive cannon in what was to be the first use of gunpowder weapons against Gibraltar's fortifications.|$|E

500|$|Although Herschel {{continued}} {{to describe his}} new object as a comet, other astronomers {{had already begun to}} suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object. Its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as [...] "a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn". Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> planet than a comet.|$|E

Patton had never seen Blue's Clues before he auditioned for the part but, like Burns, was the favorite with preschool test audiences. Burns helped train Patton to perform the role.

Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> game that I really wanted to make.

500|$|From 1705 to 1865, the Greenwich Hospital for Seamen {{provided}} {{medical care}} to injured seamen and lodgings for those injured sailors who had been pensioned off or were unable to work on ships.
