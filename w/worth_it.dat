5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy {{said that it was}} <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E

25|$|With few {{commissions}} for painting, Hazlitt {{seized the}} opportunity to ready for publication his philosophical treatise, which, according to his son, he had completed by 1803. Godwin intervened to help him find a publisher, and the work, An Essay on the Principles of Human Action: Being an Argument in favour of the Natural Disinterestedness of the Human Mind, was printed in a limited edition of 250 copies by Joseph Johnson on 19 July 1805. This gained him little notice as an original thinker, and no money. Although the treatise he valued above anything else he wrote was never, at least in his own lifetime, recognised for what he believed was its true <b>worth,</b> <b>it</b> brought him attention as one who had a grasp of contemporary philosophy. He therefore was commissioned to abridge and write a preface to a now obscure work of mental philosophy, The Light of Nature Pursued by Abraham Tucker (originally published in seven volumes from 1765 to 1777), which appeared in 1807 and may have had some influence on his own later thinking.|$|E

25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that it was <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents.

25|$|Using these variables, {{the optimal}} diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with energy value E1 and {{handling}} time h1, and small prey2 with energy value E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator {{must consider the}} profitability of the two prey types. If {{it is assumed that}} big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> Thus, the animal should only eat prey2 if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. {{how difficult it is to}} find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1.|$|E

25|$|Around 1770, a {{small group}} {{consisting}} of Spanish explorers decided that the Cosumnes River Preserve and other places within the Central Valley was a perfect pasture for grazing animals. Trappers came into {{the area around the}} preserve in the early 1800s but found that there was no place to settle and the fur trapping was not <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> The Mexican government started issuing land grants in 1844 and John Sutter who was a European immigrant {{was one of the first}} to colonize the Cosumnes River area. John Sutter founded the colony New Helvetia and soon some of his assistants moved out to the Cosumnes River Preserve area. Once the California gold rush started in 1848, many miners settled in along the Cosumnes River hoping to find gold and get rich. Once realizing that there wasn't very much gold in the region, they dammed the river and changed the landscape to grow hay, wheat, and various types of fruit. The Miwok people lost sources of food that they relied on and soon after villages and burial grounds were destroyed. Shortly after, the Miwok moved out of the region where the Cosumnes River Preserve is and in 1999, the last person to spoke Plains Miwuk died.|$|E
