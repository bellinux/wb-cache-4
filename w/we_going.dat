25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are <b>We</b> <b>Going?.</b> In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

[...] In keeping with the UFA's view of good government as being the non-partisan administration of business rather than any clash of ideologies, he concluded his speeches by asking [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to return in this Province to Government based on the two-party system, or are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to continue to work for a better ?" ...|$|E

500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to crash into some walls? Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> {{to go into a}} kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we {{can do a lot of}} different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E

He leaves Marsh behind, walking into the London night, and sometime later a second manned rocket roars into space.|$|E
500|$|Originally set for {{a single}} {{theatrical}} release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called [...] "creative imperative". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, “No, David. How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do it?”. After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.|$|E

The encounter was repeated, but both the character and the creators denied that this made Buffy gay, with Joss Whedon saying: [...] "We're not going to make her gay, nor are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to take the next 50 issues explaining that she's not. She's young and experimenting, and did I mention open-minded?".|$|E
500|$|Gig 'em: Both {{a saying}} and the thumbs up hand gesture of all Texas A University {{current and former}} {{students}} as sign of affiliation. Gig 'em also {{is the name of}} an Aggie yell. This tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before the football game against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate and member of the school's Board of Regents, asked the crowd [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do to those Horned Frogs?"

500|$|On March 12, Begaye {{announced}} {{his decision to}} keep the zoo open without expanding it and letting the remaining animals live out {{their lives on the}} zoo-grounds. According to Harry Walters, an anthropologist and former chairman of the Center for Diné Studies at Diné College in , the incident demonstrates a crucial difference between Navajo and Western culture in the way visions and supernatural experiences are handled: [...] "Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw it was nuts or not – that's what a Westerner would do – we {{look at it as a}} message: 'Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> the way we should?

When asked about the constructs created from the power rings, Campbell stated [...] "One of the nice things is, we'll all sit down and say, 'Well, what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to do here?' Really, it's as much as your imagination can go to make the constructs". The studio also confirmed to MTV News {{that the film}} would have a 3-D release.|$|E

[...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America.

500|$|The first chapter, [...] "Gauguin's Questions", {{poses the}} {{questions}} that {{provide a framework for}} the book. Referring to Paul Gauguin's painting of the same name the questions are: Where do we come from? What are we? Where are <b>we</b> <b>going?</b> Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms [...] "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age, Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.|$|E

[...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] For emphasis, he made a fist with the thumb extended. The phrase and hand signal proved popular, and it became the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference. Gig 'em is also the name of one of the school yells, which is used during football kickoffs.|$|E
500|$|The Virginia Tech defense {{looked to}} recover from its slide during the last five games of the regular season. During the Hokies' first eight games (all wins), Tech gave up averages of 10.5points, 267.5total yards and 40.8rushing yards per game. In the final five games (in which Tech went 1–4), the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32.8points, 446.7total yards and 229.4rushing yards per game. This led to doubts about Tech's ability to stop the Falcons' top-ranked rushing attack.
