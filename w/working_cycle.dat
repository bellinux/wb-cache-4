50|$|A {{positive}} <b>working</b> capital <b>cycle</b> balances incoming {{and outgoing}} payments to minimize {{net working capital}} and maximize free cash flow. For example, a company that pays its suppliers in 30 days but takes 60 days to collect its receivables has a <b>working</b> capital <b>cycle</b> of 30 days. This 30-day cycle usually needs to be funded through a bank operating line, and the interest on this financing is a carrying cost that reduces the company's profitability. Growing businesses require cash, {{and being able to}} free up cash by shortening the <b>working</b> capital <b>cycle</b> is the most inexpensive way to grow. Sophisticated buyers review closely a target's <b>working</b> capital <b>cycle</b> because it provides them with an idea of the management's effectiveness at managing their balance sheet and generating free cash flows.|$|R

30|$|Within a cluster, each node is {{responsible}} for estimating the distance from it to the target and sending this information to the CH. If the clocks of these nodes are unsynchronized, the measurements of sensors will be “drifted” because of the target movement. To overcome this problem, we adopt a simple mechanism to synchronize the <b>working</b> <b>cycles</b> of nodes in a cluster. This mechanism is based on adjusting timers for triggering the sensing action of nodes {{at the same time}} by utilizing the broadcast nature of wireless communication and predicting the sensing cycles of nodes. It consists of two steps: synchronization during target detection and clustering and synchronization during target positioning at the CH and relaying data to the BS. After realizing this cluster synchronization algorithm, the working-cycles of nodes are constructed by predefined consecutive working intervals with fixed length. Therefore, nodes in a synchronized cluster have synchronized <b>working</b> <b>cycles,</b> and it is unnecessary to synchronize the clocks of nodes.|$|R
50|$|Design of {{the flat}} {{double-acting}} Stirling engine solves the drive of a displacer {{with the help of}} the fact that areas of the hot and cold pistons of the displacer are different.The drive does so without any mechanical transmission.Using diaphragms eliminates friction and need for lubricants.When the displacer is in motion, the generator holds the working piston in the limit position, which brings the engine <b>working</b> <b>cycle</b> close to an ideal Stirling cycle.The ratio of the area of the heat exchangers to the volume of the machine increases by the implementation of a flat design.Flat design of the working cylinder approximates thermal process of the expansion and compression closer to the isothermal one.The disadvantage is a large area of the thermal insulation between the hot and cold space.|$|E
50|$|Key to the engine's <b>working</b> <b>cycle</b> was an axial {{compressor}} of then-unique construction. Most German engines {{of the era}} had the stators {{do all of the}} actual compression, with the rotors speeding up the air for them to compress. In the HeS 30, the rotor and stators shared compression about 50-50, a design originally provided by Rudolph Friedrich of Junkers. Overall the engine had a five-stage compressor providing air at a compression ratio of 3:1 to ten flame cans, which powered a single-stage turbine. The turbine was also unique for the era, using a set of guide vanes that were adjustable for various operating speeds. Like most German axial engines, the engine also included a variable-geometry exhaust cone to lower back pressure when starting, but used an electric starter motor instead of the Riedel two-stroke, opposed-twin piston engine built into the BMW 003, Jumo 004 and the later HeS 011 engine designs for startup needs.|$|E
5000|$|The lack of {{valves and}} the doubled-up <b>working</b> <b>cycle</b> {{also means that}} a {{two-stroke}} hot-bulb engine can run equally well in both directions. A common starting technique for smaller two-stroke engines is to turn the engine over against the normal direction of rotation. The piston will [...] "bounce" [...] off the compression phase with sufficient force to spin the engine the correct way and start it. This bi-directional running was an advantage in marine applications, as the engine could, like the steam engine, drive a vessel forward or in reverse {{without the need for}} a gearbox. The direction could be reversed either by stopping the engine and starting it again in the other direction, or, with sufficient skill and timing {{on the part of the}} operator, slowing the engine until it carried just enough momentum to bounce against its own compression and run the other way. This was an undesirable quality in hot-bulb-powered tractors equipped with gearboxes. At very low engine speeds the engine could reverse itself almost without any change in sound or running quality and without the driver noticing until the tractor drove in the opposite direction to that intended. Lanz Bulldog tractors featured a dial, mechanically driven by the engine, that showed a spinning arrow. The arrow pointed in the direction of normal engine rotation; if the dial spun the other way, the engine had reversed itself.|$|E
50|$|The <b>working</b> capital <b>cycle</b> (WCC) is {{the amount}} of time it takes to turn the net current assets and current {{liabilities}} into cash.
