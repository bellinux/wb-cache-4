5|$|Within {{the first}} hour, 50people were {{rescued from the}} Murrah Federal Building. Victims were sent to every {{hospital}} in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> at University Hospital, and 18 people <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> at Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats {{could be used to}} locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce coma) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.|$|E
5|$|Currently, four {{subspecies}} of ringneck are recognised, all {{of which}} have been described as distinct species in the past: (As of 1993, the twenty-eight and Cloncurry parrot <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> as subspecies of the Port Lincoln parrot and the mallee ringneck, respectively).|$|E

5|$|Over 60 {{people in}} the city of Jackson <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> for {{injuries}} {{as a result of the}} severe weather, 50 of whom were released immediately. Estimates indicate that the tornadoes caused about $47million worth of damages in Madison County, with $40million of that total occurring at Union University alone.|$|E

25|$|There are {{numerous}} processes {{that can be}} used to clean up wastewaters depending on the type and extent of contamination. Wastewater can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> in wastewater treatment plants which include physical, chemical and biological treatment processes. Municipal wastewater <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> in sewage treatment plants (which may also be referred to as wastewater treatment plants). Agricultural wastewater may <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> in agricultural wastewater treatment processes, whereas industrial wastewater <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> in industrial wastewater treatment processes.|$|R
5|$|Plant {{conservation}} and the heritage value of exceptional historic landscapes <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> {{with a growing}} sense of urgency. Specialist gardens were sometimes given a separate or adjoining site, to display native and indigenous plants.|$|E
5|$|The Texas City area {{includes}} Texas City and La Marque {{and surrounding}} communities. Until recently {{this area and}} Galveston together <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> {{by the federal government}} as a metro area distinct from Houston. The area's prosperity revolves to a great degree around the Port of Texas City and the heavy industry around it.|$|E

5|$|The film grossed {{less than}} its budget of $175 million worldwide, and {{received}} generally negative reviews. Evan Almighty was also notable for {{allegations that the}} many animals used in the film <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> poorly, but Universal Pictures stressed the animals' conditions were acceptable.|$|E
5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|All 320 {{of the men}} on duty at {{the pier}} died instantly, and 390 civilians and {{military}} personnel were injured, many seriously. Among the dead were all five Coast Guard personnel posted aboard the fire barge. African Americans suffered 202 dead and 233 injured, which accounted for 15% of all African-American naval casualties during World War II. Naval personnel worked quickly to contain the fires and to prevent other explosions. Injuries <b>were</b> <b>treated,</b> those seriously injured were hospitalized, and uninjured servicemen were evacuated to nearby stations.|$|E

50|$|Density {{functional}} theory {{seeks to}} solve for an approximate {{form of the}} electronic density of a system. In general, atoms are split into ionic cores and valence electrons. The ionic cores (nuclei plus non-bonding electrons) {{are assumed to be}} stable and <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> as a single object. Each valence electron <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> separately. Thus, for example, a Lithium atom <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> as two bodies - Li+ and e- - while oxygen <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> as three bodies, namely O2+ and 2e−.|$|R

5|$|An early {{estimate}} by the Small Business Administration put total {{damage in}} Gilroy {{at twice the}} amount of what was seen in Hollister. Ten people were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of lacerations, a cardiac problem, and anxiety. In Gilroy, the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip. Most of those that sought care (including four that were transported by ambulance) <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> and released, but six were admitted.|$|E
5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that the children were systematically punished for various infractions, and <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
5|$|Convicted {{prisoners were}} refused {{the same rights}} as internees until July 1972, when Special Category Status was {{introduced}} following a hunger strike by 40 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political, status meant prisoners <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> similarly to prisoners of war; for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.|$|E

5|$|Dartmouth {{was not as}} densely {{populated}} as Halifax and was separated from the blast by {{the width of the}} harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Almost 100 people were estimated to have died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company. Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital in Dartmouth and many of the victims <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> there.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{retreat from}} Quebec, {{and in this}} battle, wounded {{soldiers}} <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> at the Ursuline convent in Trois-Rivières. Congress never authorized payment for these services and the convent has retained the bill. By the early 21st century, the original bill of about £26 {{was estimated to be}} equivalent to between ten and twenty million Canadian dollars, if compound interest was applied. On July 4, 2009, during festivities marking the town's 375th anniversary, American Consul-General David Fetter symbolically repaid the debt to the Ursulines with a payment of C$130.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, slaves <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> harshly and oppressively during the Roman republican period. Under Republican law, a slave was not {{considered}} a person, but property. Owners could abuse, injure or even kill their own slaves without legal consequence. While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades {{who worked in the}} fields and mines were subject to a life of hard physical labor.|$|E
