50|$|Hindcasting usually {{refers to}} a {{numerical}} model integration of a historical period where no observations have been assimilated. This distinguishes a hindcast run from a reanalysis. Oceanographic observations of salinity and temperature as well as observations of surface-wave parameters such as the significant wave height are much scarcer than meteorological observations, making hindcasting more common in oceanography than in meteorology. Also, since surface waves represent a forced system where the wind is the only generating force, <b>wave</b> <b>hindcasting</b> is often considered adequate for generating a reasonable representation of the wave climate with little need for a full reanalysis.

40|$|Significant {{variability}} in the modality of mean and storm wave climates along the south-eastern Australian coast, has been observed on annual to decadal time scales. On longer timescales of interest to marine geologists, wave climate shifts result in switching of sand transport paths on the lower shoreface and alongshore via headland bypassing. Using a novel approach we use <b>wave</b> climate <b>hindcasting</b> and marine geoscience investigations to illuminate sand supply and transport processes for sections of the eastern Australian coast. The problem is approached through the combined analysis of shoreface bathymetric change and related nearshore, shoreline and spit behaviour, over a 119 year period, together with wave climate variability associated with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). A rotation in the seabed bathymetry is interpreted {{as a response to}} multidecadal processes, including: a rotation in the dominant deepwater south-easterly wave power from 120 - 140 to 140 - 160 and changes in modality between La Nina-like to El Nino-like phases of the IPO; and, associated changes in across-shoreface and headland bypassing longshore sand transport. The shift from unimodal mean and storm wave climate in the 1800 's to bimodalilty in the 1900 's is associated with large scale changes in the windfield over the Tasman Sea. Centennial scale processes can delay dynamic equilibrium over the shoreface, and our results can be applied to understanding Late Holocene shoreface evolution. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between wave {{energy and the}} seabed results in a dissipation of energy that is due to bottom friction. Work is also done on bedforms both solid and mobile (cohesive and noncohesive sediments) such as sand ripples, on suspending and moving sediment, due to percolation (Komen et al. 1994), and due to excessive breaking caused by shoaling (e. g. Babanin et al. 2001). For a relatively flat granular seabed, {{the magnitude of the}} roughness that contributes to dissipation is determined by the grain size of the sediment, and dependence of the wave-motion friction on this grain size is one of the subjects of this paper. However, the bedform of a mobile seabed can be altered due to the action of waves and currents. Experimental analysis of flow in the boundary layer found, for example, eddies moving the sediment in an orbital trajectory that results in parallel ridges (or ripples). Their formation and size is determined by the dimension of the eddies (Melnikhova amd Volkov 2000). A bottom-friction routine, based on the Nielsen algorithm (Nielsen 1981), was introduced into the SWAN model (Booij et al. 1999) which makes the bottom friction for waves dependent on presence/absence of ripples if the sea bed is mobile, and on grain size of the sediment.

High-resolution wave forecasts are useful for navigational planning, identifying wave energy resources, providing information for site-specific coastal flood models, and having an informed recreational beach user group, among other things. This forecasting model is run once a day at 1200 UTC producing 84 -h forecasts. A series of nested grids with increasing resolution shoreward are implemented to achieve a 30 -arc-second resolution at the shelf level. This resolution is significantly higher than what the current operational models produce, thus improving the ability to quantify the alongshore variations of wave conditions on the PNW coast. Normalized root-mean-squared errors in significant wave height and mean wave period range from 0. 13 to 0. 24 and from 0. 13 to 0. 26, respectively. Visualization of the forecasts is made available online and is presently being used by recreational beach users and the scientific community.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find a suitable model for predicting longshore sediment transport rate for Krueng Aceh Urgent Flood Control Project in Indonesia. Black Box approach was used in the study by employing the U. S. Army CERC-formula. To employ the CERC-formula, wave properties i. e., wave height, wave period and wave direction are required as data input. For longshore sediment transport estimation, a K-value of 0. 39 was used since H₁/₃ and T₁/₃ were used in the study. Estimated longshore sediment transport was, then, compared to actual sediment trapped at the jetty which is in the study site. To estimate the volume of sediment trapped during periods of study, three cross sectional surveys were conducted. The first survey was in May 1992, second was in May 1993, and the last one was in August 1993. [...] Three procedures in estimating wave properties were tried. First, wind speed and direction at the study site (Alue Naga station) were estimated using wind data of another station (Blang Bintang station) employing vector regression analysis. Since the vector correlation coefficients were found to be very low, the procedure was not continued. Second, linear regression was used to estimate monthly average wind speeds at Alue Naga using data of Blang Bintang. Using monthly average wind speed data, the correlation coefficient of these stations was quite good. The procedure was continued to predict wave data from estimated wind speed. Third, the available wave data of a previous period were used, since the wind climate of this period and the period of study are almost identical.

40|$|In {{relevant}} Norwegian regulations, {{the characteristic}} response {{is defined as}} a given annual probability of exceedance. Effective and accurate methods of estimating the response for the required annual probability levels are consequently {{a vital part of the}} design. The thesis provides an overview of the riser systems that are currently available, along with a description of the main loads acting on the systems. Further, methods for predicting extreme response are presented. The most consistent method of predicting the characteristic extreme response of a complicated nonlinear system is the all sea-states approach. However, due to it being computationally very demanding, alternative less demanding methods such as the contour plot method have been developed. In this thesis, both methods will be used to determine the 100 -year return response value of a riser system consisting of a steel catenary riser connected to a semi-submersible at 1000 meters depth. The value derived from the all sea-states method will serve as a benchmark response level in order to determine the necessary percentile level for the short-term response of the critical sea-state along the contour plot. Additionally, a comparative study of environmental parameters derived from in situ <b>wave</b> measurements versus <b>hindcasting</b> of meteorological data was conducted. The pre-processing of the environmental data and post-processing of the response analysis was executed using MATLAB. The modeling and time domain simulations of the riser systems were conducted using the software package SIMA/Riflex. The required percentile level to account for short-term variability was discovered to be 0. 997, which is significantly higher than the recommended NORSOK value of 0. 9. The high percentile level is likely due to the large amount of variability carried by the short-term extreme value distribution relative to the slowly varying environmental characteristics, due to the high degree of nonlinearity in the system. The vessels pitch period coinciding with the high-energy wave period is likely to have caused large dynamic effects on the system, consequently increasing the percentile level substantially. Note, the value given by NORSOK is not necessarily representative for the system, but merely meant as a guidance value. The short time step required in the analysis to obtain a stable numerical solution for the worst sea-states also indicates pronounced nonlinear characteristics. The comparative study of in situ wave measurements and hindcast data indicates a slightly higher Hs-peak for the hindcast based contour plot, and a significantly higher Tp-peak for the in situ wave measurements. Further comparative studies are necessary to draw any conclusions, but the hindcast data seem to give sufficiently accurate estimate of the contour in the more critical areas around the high-energy waves. </p...|$|R

The numerical wave models express the physical concepts of the phenomena. The performance of the numerical wave model depends on how best the phenomena are expressed into the numerical schemes, so that more accurate wave parameters could be estimated. There are still scopes for improving the numerical wave models. When exact input-output parameters are known for the same phenomenon, it can be well de-fined by the neural network. Hindcasting of ocean wave parameters using neural networks shows its potential usefulness. It is observed that the short-term wave predictions using neural networks are very close to the actual ones. It is also ob-served that the neural network simplifies not only the complex phenomena, but also predicts fairly accurate wave parame-ters...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{waves are}} the most {{important}} environmental forces acting on the marine structures. Due to the incompleteness of measured wave parameters, wave prediction {{plays a key role in}} the design of coastal and offshore structures. Nowadays, numerical wind wave models are widely used for wave hindcast and forecast. Since wind is the most important forcing term in the numerical wind wave model, the selection of appropriate wind source is a vital step in the wave modeling. In the present study; two wind sources i. e. the measured synoptic and the ECMWF (European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts) data, were evaluated for wave simulation near the Chabahar zone. To simulate wave parameters the third generation spectral SWAN model was utilized and the results were compared with those of in situ measurements in a depth of about 17 m. The whitecapping dissipation coefficient and bottom friction factor were used for calibration of the model. The sensitivity analysis showed that other physical parameters have no specific effect on the wave characteristics. Calibration of whitecapping dissipation rate led to the overestimation of high waves. Therefore, a combination of whitecapping dissipation and bottom friction factors was used to calibrate the model. It was found that the SWAN model forced by ECMWF wind data predicted the south-west and west waves successfully while underestimated the east, south-east and south waves. This was mainly due to well prediction of south-west and west wind and underestimation of wind from the east to the south by the ECMWF model. In addition, it was revealed that synoptic wind data can be used as an appropriate wind source for <b>wave</b> <b>hindcasting</b> at the studied area. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to determine characteristics of the directional energy distribution of wind generated waves on the basis of observations with a relatively high resolution. Approximately 75 observations of the above distribution are studied. They are selected from five spectra which are determined from stereophotographic observations of the sea surface. Three of these spectra were obtained in a so-called ideal generation situation. This is a situation where a homogeneous, stationary wind blows perpendicularly off a straight coast over deep water. The other two spectra were observed in similar situations. The difference with the ideal situation is for one spectrum that the wind was slanting across the coastline and for the other that the coastline was irregular. The observed distributions are compared with the cos²s (?/ 2) -model introduced by Longuet-Higgins et al. (1963). The differences between the observations and this model can be quantified due to the high resolution of the observations. It is found in the ideal situation that the model agrees well for most practical purposes with the observed distributions. In fact, the model is found to be highly consistent with those observations in the ideal situation for which a consistency analysis was carried out. In the other two situations it is found that the shape of the directional energy distribution is strongly influenced by the geometry of the upwind coastline. Thls suggests a directionally decoupled generation of the waves. The results of a simple parametric <b>wave</b> <b>hindcasting</b> model support this suggestion. The shape of the observed functional relationship between the width parameter s of the cos²s(?/ 2) -model and the wavenumber agrees fairly well with the shapes suggested by Mitsuyasu et al.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} shore {{processes}} of Lake Pukaki {{to assess the}} suitability and performance of existing and potential future options for management of shore hazards. Following two successive raisings of the water level in the past sixty years, Lake Pukaki’s shoreline has undergone extensive erosion. Since mid 1987 until early 1988, shoreline erosion control structures (i. e. rock revetments, gabion baskets and groynes) were constructed and maintained to protect sections of road and other assets from further encroachment of the lake shoreline. The use of the RBR XR- 620 pressure sensor in this study marks the first occasion when wave statistics were measured via instrumentation at Lake Pukaki. The mean significant wave height (Hs) identified {{for this study was}} 0. 53 m, while the maximum recorded wave height was 1. 84 m. Similar to other alpine lakes, Lake Pukaki has characteristics of steep plunging waves. The LAKEWAVE <b>wave</b> <b>hindcasting</b> model is used to describe the wave environment about the Lake Pukaki shoreline in terms of its optimum energy potential. The maximum wave height and wave period values estimated by LAKEWAVE have been found to compare well with measured wave statistics. Under the current wave climate, experienced during this study period (July 2010 – February 2011), the majority of the assessed rock revetments seem to be performing well. The Hudson and Van der Meer formula seemed to predict respectable stability thresholds that agree with what was observed in the field. The revetment at Site 3 is the biggest concern in terms of performance based on field observations. The short-period high-magnitude storm events, eventuating from a strong north/northwest wind flow, that coincide with high lake levels tend to cause the most significant erosion along the shoreline at Lake Pukaki and have a major influence of riprap stability. Other environmental factors including the steep nearshore profile, the glacial till backshore, groundwater and precipitation were identified as controlling factors leading to {{the success or failure of}} the shore protection structures...|$|E

Knowledge of the wave climate and trends in this region are critical {{to better understand the}} last decade's evolution of coastal hazards and morphology and to anticipate their potential future changes. This study aims to characterize the long-term trends of the present wave climate over {{the second half of the}} twentieth century in the Bay of Biscay through a robust and homogeneous intercomparison of five-wave datasets (Corrected ERA- 40 (C-ERA- 40), ECMWF Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim), Bay Of Biscay Wave Atlas (BOBWA- 10 kH), ANEMOC, and Bertin and Dodet 2010)). The comparison of the quality of the datasets against offshore and nearshore measurements reveals that at offshore locations, global reanalyses slightly underestimate wave heights, while regional hindcasts overestimate wave heights, especially for the highest quantiles. At coastal locations, BOBWA- 10 kH is the dataset that compares the best with observations. Concerning long time-scale features, the comparison highlights that the main significant trends are similarly present in the five datasets, especially during summer for which there is an increase of significant wave heights and mean wave periods (up to + 15 cm and + 0. 6 s over the period 1970 - 2001) as well as a southerly shift of wave directions (around − 0. 4 ° year− 1). Over the same period, an increase of high quantiles of wave heights during the autumn season (around 3 cm year− 1 for 90 th quantile of significant wave heights (SWH 90)) is also apparent. During winter, significant trends are much lower than during summer and autumn despite a slight increase of wave heights and periods during 1958 - 2001. These trends can be related to modifications in the wave-type occurrence. Finally, the trends common to the five datasets are discussed by analyzing the similarities with centennial trends issued from longer time-scale studies and exploring the various factors that could explain them...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of the Oceans and Seas have been exploited by societies for many centuries; the marine offshore and naval sectors have been the predominant users of the waters. It has been overlooked until recently, that significant amounts of energy can be harnessed by waves, providing an additional abundant resource for renewable energy generation. The increasing energy needs of current societies {{have led to the}} consideration of waves as an exploitable renewable resource. During the past decades, advancements have been made towards commercialising wave energy converters (WECs), though significant knowledge gap exists on the accurate estimation of the potential energy that can be harnessed. In order, to enhance our understanding of opportunities within wave energy highly resolved long-term resource assessment of potential sites are necessary, which will allow for not only a detailed energy estimation methodology but also information on extreme waves that are expected to affect the survivability and reliability of future wave energy converters. This research work aims to contribute the necessary knowledge to the estimation of wave energy resources from both highly energetic and milder sea environment, exhibiting the opportunities that lay within these environments. A numerical model SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore), based on spectral wave formulation has been utilised for <b>wave</b> <b>hindcasting</b> which was driven by high resolution temporal and spatially varying wind data. The capabilities of the model, allow a detailed representation of several coastal areas, which are not usually accurately resolved by larger ocean models. The outcome of this research provides long-term data and characterisation of the wave environment and its extremes for the Scottish region. Moreover, investigation on the applicability of wave energy in the Mediterranean Sea, an area which was often overlooked, showed that wave energy is more versatile than expected. The outcomes provide robust estimations of extreme wave values for coastal waters, alongside valuable information about the usage of numerical modelling and WECs to establish energy pattern production. Several key tuning factors and inputs such as boundary wind conditions and computational domain parameters are tested. This was done in a systematic way in order to establish a customized solution and detect parameters that may hinder the process and lead to erroneous results. The uncertainty of power production by WECs is reduced by the introduction of utilization rates based on the long-term data, which include annual and seasonal variability. This will assist to minimize assumptions for energy estimates and financial returns in business plans. Finally, the importance of continuous improvements in resource assessment is stressed in order to enhance our understanding of the wave environment...|$|E
