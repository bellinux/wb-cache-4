Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially hesitant to report there, <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> he was ready for Class AAA baseball. In his first at bat at the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall and seemed to collect a triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second base.|$|E

5|$|The story {{continues}} {{with the arrival}} of several more Christian princes and their armies. Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandián accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandián is the most handsome and elegant man that has ever existed. Calafia determines that she must see the man herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga embroidered with jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandián from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should live, that she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandián considers Calafia an infidel, an abomination of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, and he makes no response.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them {{that it was a good}} idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the year, Alpha Oumar Konaré, the {{chairman}} of the commission of the African Union and former president of Mali, reportedly urged Bozizé not to stand for election. Bozizé gave an interview to Radio France Internationale on May 17 in which he refused to say whether or not he would run, but he confirmed that Konaré had spoken to him about it, while criticizing Konaré for what he called interference in the country's affairs, and <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> he had consulted the opinions of the Central African people before getting involved. He stressed that the matter would depend on the will of the people. Some of his supporters campaigned prominently for him to stand. About 5,000 people walked in Bangui on June 19 to support his candidacy; Bozizé thanked them and asked for time to reflect.|$|E
25|$|GDP growth {{returned}} {{in the third}} quarter of 2009, expanding at a 1.6% pace, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter. Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010. The country's GDP consistently grew by about 2% in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. However, median household income (adjusted for inflation) fell to $53,600 in 2014, down from an inflation-adjusted $57,400 in 2007, just before the start of the Great Recession. The poverty rate peaked at 15.1% in 2010 but declined to 13.5% in 2015, which is still higher than the 12.5% pre-recession figure of 2007. The relatively small GDP growth rates in the United States and other developed countries following the Great Recession left economists and others <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> U.S. growth rates would ever return to the levels seen in the second half of the twentieth century.|$|E
