5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm also felt he was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too was {{released}} by Smalltown Supersound on August 18, 2008 in the United Kingdom, and August 19 in the United States. A special edition was issued on December 23, 2008. The album featured a bonus disc with edited versions of the original tracks by frequent Lindstrøm collaborator Prins Thomas. Lindstrøm toured in Austria, Germany, Spain, and the United States that fall.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
500|$|<b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too debuted at No. 11 on the Norwegian music chart. The {{following}} week {{it fell to}} No. 27 before leaving the list. The record did not chart internationally. In 2009, <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too received a Spellemannprisen award for [...] "best electronica album". The album was well received by critics and received an 82 out of 100 on the aggregate website Metacritic, which signifies [...] "universal acclaim".|$|E
500|$|<b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too is {{the first}} studio album by Norwegian electronica artist Hans-Peter Lindstrøm. It was first {{released}} in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2008 and was subsequently released {{the next day in}} the United States. The album comprises three tracks, roughly 30, 10, and 15 minutes in length. <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too is usually labeled [...] "space disco" [...] due to its [...] "spacey, psychedelic" [...] feel and four-to-the-floor beats.|$|E

The songs grow and develop independent musical traits, such as motifs, polyrhythms, and melodies. According to The Guardian, some musical changes are pronounced, such as {{the introduction of a}} synthesizer, while others, such as small tempo changes, remain [...] "almost insensible". Some critics have noted the album conjures the feeling of a journey.|$|E

[...] Pitchfork editor Tim Finney believed <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too showed signs of a masterpiece, but also possessed [...] "bloat, excess, and splendor" [...] reminiscent of disco revivalists.

500|$|The {{music is}} a collage of {{electronic}} music, characterized by synthesized melodies, layered sounds, live performances, and [...] four-to-the-floor beats. Pitchfork editor Dominique Leone {{described it as a}} [...] "seamless combination of digital production, analog synthesizers and live instrumentation." [...] Lindstrøm has been heavily influenced by music from the 1970s and 1980s, particularly disco progenitors Jean-Marc Cerrone and Giorgio Moroder. <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too is often classified as [...] "space disco" [...] due to these influences and because it possesses a [...] "spacey, psychedelic" [...] sound. Lindstrøm listened to the Beach Boys, the Eagles, and Kirsty MacColl while writing the album.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic writer K. Ross Hoffman {{declared}} the record an [...] "entirely satisfying display" [...] of Lindstrøm's talents and positively {{commented on the}} textured instrumentation. Hoffman concluded the music was an [...] "expansive, exploratory journey" [...] worth experiencing. Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club disagreed, believing the album to be narrow minded and a missed opportunity to exploit the lengthy tracks and deliver more musical depth. Praise was given by Alex Macpherson of The Guardian, who stated [...] "Every aspect of the record seems tailor-made to produce maximum pleasure [...] <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> I Go Too would make even the most hellish of journeys seem like a first-class trip." ...|$|E

500|$|Although forty-six {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Martin Truex, Jr. clinched his third pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 26.643. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kurt Busch. Johnson qualified third, Kahne took fourth, and Hamlin started fifth. Biffle, Kyle Busch, Stewart, Casey Mears and Martin completed the top ten positions. The three drivers that failed to qualify were Regan Smith, Kevin Conway and Brandon Ash. After the qualifier Truex said, [...] "(Today) we were pretty good in practice. This is a weird track <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out in practice, then expect to pick up a half-second somehow (in qualifying). We did. It's strange, but it felt good." ...|$|E

[...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up.

500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E
