5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} why Michelangelo {{selected}} the five particular Sibyls that were depicted, given that, as with the Minor Prophets, there were ten or twelve possibilities.

Blado {{is named after}} the printer Antonio Blado, a {{colleague}} of Arrighi. Morison preferred Bembo's roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus. Unlike Bembo, both in metal featured a Greek-influenced Y with a curving head, as in the original.|$|E

This was created {{at the same time as}} the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} took place in 1811 to consider how the situation could be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed {{an extension of the}} canal {{to the top of the}} Gwendraeth valley, and another which would cross Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13collieries which would be served in this way. Wharfs at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a lock and weir, <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal.|$|E
