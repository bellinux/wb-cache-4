5|$|Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, {{there was}} a call for the product's {{reinstatement}} from fans of the product on forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that {{they are one of}} the 17 most requested fast products that people would like to see returned to menus. Fans of the product also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as a limited time offering (LTO). The return of the product met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as well because of the product's status as a limited time offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.|$|E

This results in a brief conflict between the two, Luthor claiming that Superman's 'unprovoked' attack proves that he is an impostor while Superman counters that Luthor's brutal response proves him right, but the fight is cut short when Doomsday apparently emerges. Despite Superman's uncertainty about Luthor and Luthor's own beliefs about Superman, Superman convinces Luthor to help him by focusing on evacuating civilians while he deals with Doomsday due to his greater experience. After the crisis is over, Superman talks with Luthor and agrees to let him continue acting as a hero using his logo when Superman concedes that he has no clear evidence that this Luthor has any criminal activity. Luthor is later attacked by an alien warrior who attacks people who, according to visions of the future he receives, will go on to commit various acts of death and violence, but Superman appeals to them to let Luthor free by arguing that the future is always changing and he will do his best to ensure that the dark future they foresaw for Luthor <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> to pass.|$|E

Kapp attempts to repair his equipment in order to contact the alien presence, but the Planet People destroy his efforts. They try {{to persuade him to}} join them but he refuses, convinced now that his family are dead. Quatermass, aided by Gurov, who has travelled to London from Moscow, assembles a team of scientists to find a solution. He deliberately selects old people for the task as they are immune to the effects of the alien force. Quatermass decides to set a trap. He plans to fake the presence of a large gathering of Planet People at Kapp's observatory and, when the force comes, to detonate a nuclear weapon. Quatermass does not believe this will be sufficient to destroy the alien machine but he hopes that it will damage it enough to make it go away. Kapp volunteers to stay behind with Quatermass to help detonate the bomb. The pair set up the trap and wait. Suddenly, Kickalong appears with a group of Planet People, including Quatermass' granddaughter, Hettie. Kapp tries to warn them away but is shot by Kickalong. The light appears, indicating that the alien force has arrived, but the shock of seeing his granddaughter among the Planet People causes Quatermass to suffer a heart attack. However, aided by Hettie, he is able to detonate the bomb. Later, according to Gurov, [...] "The message was taken. It has not come again. We pray it <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> again".|$|E
500|$|In 1813, {{with the}} tide of the Napoleonic Wars having turned firmly in Britain's favour, George began to seriously {{consider}} the question of Charlotte's marriage. [...] The Prince Regent and his advisors decided on William, Hereditary Prince of Orange, son and heir-apparent of Prince William VI of Orange. [...] Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George's birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself {{and many of the}} guests. [...] Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers. [...] Dr. Henry Halford was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner. Believing that his daughter intended to marry Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester. [...] According to Charlotte, [...] "He spoke as if he had the most improper ideas of my inclinations. [...] I see that he is compleatly [...] poisoned against me, and that he <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> round." [...] She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time. The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry [...] "the Orange or the Cheese" [...] (a reference to Gloucester cheese), [...] "Slender Billy" [...] or [...] "Silly Billy". [...] The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that [...] "I could not quit this country, as Queen of England still less" [...] and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to [...] "visit his frogs solo". [...] However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision. [...] She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} appears {{when there}} is no natural choice of elements from each set. [...] If we cannot make explicit choices, {{how do we know that}} our set exists? [...] For example, suppose that X is the set of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers. [...] First we might try to proceed as if X were finite. [...] If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because X is infinite, our choice procedure <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of X. [...] Next we might try specifying the least element from each set. [...] But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if x is in (0,1), then so is x/2, and x/2 is always strictly smaller than x. [...] So this attempt also fails.|$|E
