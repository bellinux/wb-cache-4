25|$|The {{first victory}} for the Bf 110 in this {{capacity}} was recorded on 4 February 1943 against a B-24 formation attacking Hamm. The Germans suffered from defensive fire as the Bf 110s were a bigger target. Along with the seven Fw 190s and five lost by JG 1, all eight IV./NJG 1s Bf 110s were damaged. They claimed three B-17s, although only one was lost. The reason for the failure {{was the lack of}} training in day fighter tactics. Hans-Joachim Jabs said;This <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>only</b> day victory in a night fighter. We flew these missions at no greater than Schwarm strength, and were ourselves never escorted. It was wasteful to use highly trained night fighter crews in this role, and it was given up when the US escorts appeared.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art. At the same parties {{during which he}} banged his head against those of other men, Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife. Sage, according to friends’ accounts, made no response to her husband’s aggression except {{to try to persuade}} him to go home. Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage’s painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her. The couple must have shared different feelings in private, however, because all accounts agree that Sage was devastated by Tanguy’s death. “Yves <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>only</b> friend who understood everything,” she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, an old friend of Tanguy’s, about a month after Tanguy’s fatal stroke.|$|E
500|$|Maureen Teefy, an {{established}} actress of Irish descent, was cast as Doris Finsecker, a shy and uptight Jewish girl. De Silva disagreed with Teefy's casting, stating, [...] "...I'd envisioned [...] as a 16-or 17-year-old Barbra Streisand from Brooklyn, and when [...] cast this Irish actress {{that was a}} trouble... that <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>only</b> reservation; I really had envisioned {{she was a young}} Barbra Streisand, a Jewish girl." [...] Parker and the casting department had difficulty finding an actress for the role of Hilary Van Doren. Antonia Franceschi, who had previously acted as a background dancer in the musical Grease (1978), secured the role based on the strength of her audition. Meg Tilly appears in her acting debut as a principal dancer. In his first credited screen role, Peter Rafelson, son of Bob Rafelson, appears as a principal musician and vocalist.|$|E

2500|$|The Marshalls {{had long}} before decided that John {{was to be}} a lawyer. William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England had been {{published}} in America and Thomas Marshall bought a copy for his own use and for John to read and study. After John returned home from Campbell's academy he continued his studies with no other aid than his dictionary. John's father superintended the English part of his education. Marshall wrote of his father, [...] "... and to his care I am indebted for anything valuable which I may have acquired in my youth. He <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>only</b> intelligent companion; and was both a watchful parent and an affectionate friend".|$|E
2500|$|To {{enhance the}} {{intensity}} between his characters, Bhansali wanted a correctly intense reference point for Hrithik and Aishwarya's feelings and conversations. Bhansali {{said that he}} thought the sentiment of thwarted passion and smothered intensity of star-crossed lovers in Romeo & Juliet expressed his protagonists' inexpressible feelings very well. Hence he included dialogues from Zeffirelli's Romeo & Juliet in Guzaarish. Bhansali insisted on Zeffirelli's version since to him [...] "..his work is the ultimate tribute to Shakespeare's love story. So many times, I've wanted to do my own version of Romeo & Juliet. But one look at Zeffirelli's film makes me feel I can never equal his beauty grandeur harmony and principal casting." [...] Though {{it was difficult to}} obtain permission to use the materials, an adamant Bhansali accomplished the feat. He said," [...] This <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>only</b> chance to pay homage to one of my all-time favourite screen romances." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Gravano's rise {{in status}} to consigliere, Gotti {{continued}} to use Gravano for the task of murder. In May 1988, Gravano and Robert Bisaccia, a New Jersey crime family soldier, murdered Francessco Oliverri for beating a Gambino family crew member to death. Bisaccia shot Oliverri to death while Gravano waited in a stolen get-away car. After Oliverri, John Gotti had finally got around to taking care of Wilfred [...] "Willie Boy" [...] Johnson. Johnson had been a childhood friend of Gotti's and a longtime crew member while Gotti was captain of the Bergin crew. However, at Gotti's RICO trial, Diane Giacalone, the head prosecutor, revealed that Johnson had been an informant for the FBI for years. Johnson refused to testify for the prosecution. In Underboss Gravano claims that Gotti met with Johnson during the trial and informed Johnson {{that as long as}} he never testified against Gotti, he and his family would not be harmed. Johnson would never be allowed to participate in mob matters again, however. Johnson asked Gotti to swear on his dead son, Frank Gotti, who had been killed in an accident years ago. Gotti swore. Now Gotti was having second thoughts. [...] "John discussed how it should go, using me to bounce off ideas about {{the best way to do}} it. That <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>only</b> involvement," [...] Gravano explained. Johnson was shot while walking to his car to go to work in front of his house in May 1988. In 1990, Gravano was involved in two murders, the first of which was Eddie Garofalo, a demolition contractor who made the mistake of running afoul of the Gambinos. On August 9, 1990, Garofalo was shot to death in front of his home as arranged by Gravano.|$|E
