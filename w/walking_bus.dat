40|$|Our {{interest}} in connectivity and student health {{led us to}} Joni Axel, Community Program Manager of the Blue Zones committee in Muscatine, who spoke {{to us about the}} Walking School Bus program. We met with Joni Axel, the Community Program Manager of Blue Zones in Muscatine. She discussed the modern-day fears about kids walking on their own, as well as the way that the paths in cities inhibit movement. She was adamant about kids needing more exercise, offering many examples and ideas about how to improve these habits. One such way to implement more exercise for kids and appease the fears of parents is the <b>walking</b> school <b>bus.</b> This was an idea that Joni was instrumental in incorporating in Muscatine, and she continues to {{play a key role in}} its application. She knew a lot about the <b>walking</b> school <b>bus</b> program and was very passionate about it. Her enthusiasm about the program got us excited about its goals and encouraged us to look critically at our own lifestyles and share her message with others...|$|R

5000|$|In some countries, parents and/or {{children}} on walking buses {{are encouraged to}} wear brightly coloured jackets or waistcoats. This has led to criticism that the <b>walking</b> <b>bus</b> is too regimented, and fails to achieve its original purpose of improving children's independent mobility. David Engwicht, whose 1992 book [...] "Reclaiming our Cities and Towns" [...] is credited by some as {{the origin of the}} Walking School Bus concept, has since stated that [...] "The moment the <b>Walking</b> <b>Bus</b> turns into an official program, it creates some significant difficulties, particularly in litigious and risk-adverse cultures." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we discuss}} our {{implementation}} of a web-based navigation system for the campus of Texas A&M University. This application represents the campus as a roadmap; a set of vertices and weighted edges. We designed a multilayer roadmap for our application that supports multiple methods of traversing each edge; in the campus environment, these methods represent different modes of transportation (e. g. <b>walking,</b> driving, riding <b>bus).</b> The resulting paths our navigator provides can be composed of segments of different transportation types; for instance, a long path across campus might include <b>walking</b> to a <b>bus</b> stop, riding the <b>bus,</b> then <b>walking</b> from the <b>bus</b> to the destination. An important benefit of our implementation is its simplicity. When dealing with a campus as large as Texas A&M, {{it is important that}} students, faculty, staff, and visitors be able to easily enter queries with little/no prior knowledge of the campus, and then clearly understand how to follow the resulting path to their destination. Also, an intuitive interface provides an adminstrator to easily expand/maintain the campus roadmap. Our efforts produced a navigation application that will aid {{the tens of thousands of}} people in finding their way around the campus of Texas A&M University. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{communities}} that support walking buses may see reduced congestion around school grounds. The <b>walking</b> <b>bus</b> is a non-polluting and sustainable transport alternative to cars and buses. In {{regards to the}} safety of the walking bus; the section about Safe Routes to School below goes into more detail about improvements being made to increase the safety for commuting pedestrians.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>walking</b> <b>bus</b> {{is a form}} {{of student}} {{transport}} for schoolchildren who, chaperoned by two adults (a [...] "Driver" [...] leads and a [...] "conductor" [...] follows), walk to school along a set route, {{in much the same way}} a school bus would drive them to school. Like a traditional bus, walking buses have a fixed route with designated [...] "bus stops" [...] and [...] "pick up times" [...] in which they pick up children.|$|E
50|$|This law {{is central}} to the success of {{programs}} like the <b>Walking</b> <b>Bus</b> because it identifies the many components involved. Active transport to school and examples such as the walking school bus require collaboration from many different sectors (transportation, law enforcement, school policies, and local government to name a few). In addition, the ability to create an environment conducive to walkability is dependent on the built environment as well as numerous policies from these various sectors.|$|E
50|$|Most Lytton Park {{residents}} are within <b>walking</b> distance of <b>bus</b> routes that run along Yonge Street and Avenue Road (142 Downtown/Avenue Road Express; 61 Avenue Road North).

50|$|Natural land-use {{patterns}} {{within the}} city of Curitiba support public transit systems. Buildings along the dedicated busways are up to six stories tall, gradually giving way, within a few blocks, to single story homes. This mix of densities ensures sufficient user population within <b>walking</b> distance of <b>bus</b> stops.|$|R
40|$|Active {{commuting}} to school increases children’s daily physical activity. The built environment {{is associated with}} children’s physical activity levels in cross-sectional studies. This study examined {{the role of the}} built environment on the out- comes of a “walking school bus” study. Geographical information systems was used to map out and compare the built envi- ronments around schools participating in a pilot <b>walking</b> school <b>bus</b> randomised controlled trial, as well as along school routes. Multi-level modelling was used to determine the built environment attributes associated with the outcomes of active {{commuting to}} school and accelerometer-determined moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MPVA). There were no differ- ences in the surrounding built environments of control (n = 4) and intervention (n = 4) schools participating in the <b>walking</b> school <b>bus</b> study. Among school walking routes, park space was inversely associated with active commuting to school (β = - 0. 008, SE = 0. 004, P = 0. 03), while mixed-land use was positively associated with daily MPVA (β = 60. 0, SE = 24. 3, P = 0. 02). There was effect modification such that high traffic volume and high street connectivity were associated with greater moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the built environment may play a role in active school commuting outcomes and daily physical activity...|$|R

Today the event has grown to include international artists. It has also moved to the plaine de L'Asse, accessible either by <b>walking,</b> <b>bus</b> or the Chemin de fer Nyon-St-Cergue-Morez narrow-gauge railway.|$|E
5000|$|A {{riding school}} bus {{is a group}} of {{schoolchildren}} supervised by one or more adults, riding pedal cycles along a set route, picking kids up at [...] "bus stops" [...] along the way until they all arrive at school. Riding school buses are similar to <b>walking</b> <b>bus</b> programs. Like a traditional bus, riding school buses (also known as RSBs) have a fixed route with designated [...] "bus stops" [...] and [...] "pick up times" [...] in which they pick up children. Ideally the riding school bus will include at least 1 adult ‘driver’, who leads the group, and an adult ‘conductor' who supervises {{from the end of the}} group.|$|E
50|$|According to the Safe Routes to School National Partnership, 1 mile {{of walking}} equates to 2/3rds of the {{recommendation}} of 60 minutes a day. In addition to the potential health benefits, the <b>walking</b> school <b>bus</b> can help children arrive to school safely, on time, and ready to learn. Walking to school counts towards the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Another benefit is the positive association between physical activity and improved academic performance. In a study done by the CDC, they found that {{with a minimum of}} 60 minutes a day there were increase in academic behavior, cognitive skills and attitudes.|$|R
40|$|Smartphones are everywhere, {{and they}} are a very {{attractive}} platform to perform unobtrusive monitoring of users. In this work, we use common features of modern smartphones to build a human activity recognition (HAR) system for elderly care. We have built a classifier that detects the transport mode of the user including whether an individual is inactive, <b>walking,</b> in <b>bus,</b> in car, in train or in metro. We evaluated our approach using over 24 hours of transportation data from a group of 15 individuals. Our tests show that our classifier can detect the transportation mode with over 90 % accuracy. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
50|$|The <b>walking</b> school <b>bus</b> {{can help}} to reduce {{childhood}} obesity rates in the United States by increasing active transportation to school. The American Public Health Association cites that participation in active transportation to school has reduced by a third in the last 40 years. The reduction in active transportation has coincided {{with an increase in}} childhood obesity rates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the prevalence of obesity among children has doubled and among adolescents has quadrupled in the past 30 years. In 2012, 18% of children and 21% of adolescents were obese.|$|R
