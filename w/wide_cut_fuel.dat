50|$|BAE Systems is {{considering}} upgrading the CV90 with a hybrid-electric propulsion system as armies look to <b>cut</b> <b>fuel</b> expenses, due to {{environmental issues and}} fuel economy. A hybrid-electric drive could <b>cut</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption by 10 to 30 percent. The new system would also provide a power boost to move the vehicle. The hybrid-electric combines a standard diesel engine with a battery pack to provide extra power to propel the vehicle or provide additional electricity.|$|R

40|$|Energy Concepts has {{developed}} an absorption-augmented system as a cost-effective means of achieving more cooling capacity with a substantial reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for industrial refrigeration. It <b>cuts</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption by 30 % by combining an internal combustion engine with a mechanical compression refrigeration system and an absorption refrigeration system. The absorption system is powered by engine waste heat. Conventional industrial refrigeration uses mechanical vapor compression, powered by electric motors, which results in higher energy costs. By the year 2010, the new system could <b>cut</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption by 19 trillion Btu and greenhouse emissions by more than 1 million tons per year...|$|R
50|$|Yudhoyono also {{allocated}} more {{funds in}} an effort to further decrease poverty. In 2004, 11 trillion rupiah was set aside, increasing to 23 trillion in 2005 and 42 trillion in 2006. For 2007, 51 trillion was allocated. In March 2005 and again in October 2005, Yudhoyono made the unpopular decision to <b>cut</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidies, leading to increases in fuel prices of 29% and 125% respectively. The poor were somewhat compensated by the Direct Cash Assistance (BLT), but the subsidy cutting damaged Yudhoyono's popularity. In May 2008, rising oil prices contributed to Yudhoyono's decision to again <b>cut</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidies, which were the subject of protests in May and June 2008.|$|R

The servicing of CO2 systems will be less costly and less complicated than that for present systems. For the consumer {{the total cost of}} ownership is lowest with CO2 as it will significantly <b>cut</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption by the air conditioning device. Carmakers have to make an initial investment estimated at €20 per unit, with no additional costs once CO2 Technology enters into mass production.|$|R

50|$|All {{injection}} pumps incorporate a governor to <b>cut</b> <b>fuel</b> supply if the crankshaft rpm endangers the engine - the heavy moving parts of diesel engines do not tolerate overspeeding well, and catastrophic damage can occur {{if they are}} over-revved. Poorly maintained and worn engines can consume their lubrication oil through worn out crankcase ventilation systems and 'run away', causing increasing engine speed until the engine destroys itself. This is because most diesel engines only regulate their speed by fuel supply control and don't have a throttle valve to control air intake.|$|R
