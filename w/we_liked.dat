25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Davis—the band's bassist—expounded on {{what they}} felt before {{releasing}} the song, [...] "After we started writing weird stuff like 'Ain't It Fun', we got nervous. But that was a comfort. We've grown and we don't like the same music <b>we</b> <b>liked,</b> so why would [...] not? That idea kept us pushing ourselves." [...] York considered {{that the decision to}} bring a gospel choir would have been difficult to approve if the original lineup of the band had remained. The track was mixed by Ken Andrews, and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound Studios.|$|E

Ellen McLain provided {{the voice of the}} antagonist GLaDOS. Erik Wolpaw noted, [...] "When we were still fishing around for the turret voice, Ellen did a sultry version. It didn't work for the turrets, but <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> it a lot, and so a slightly modified version of that became the model for GLaDOS's final incarnation." [...] Mike Patton performed the growling and snarling voice of GLaDOS's final personality core, named the Anger Sphere.|$|E

[...] He also explained that this CD has both the catchiest and most mature songs they've ever recorded and called it a [...] "step forward." ...|$|E
500|$|Earthsuit {{began in}} 1995 as a {{collaboration}} between Adam LaClave and Paul Meany, who began composing music together after being introduced at a church in New Orleans. In an interview with Family Christian Stores, Meany explained that a sermon was {{the inspiration for the}} band's name: [...] "...This man was preaching about how humans are really spirit beings encased in fleshly bodies. The term [...] "earth suit" [...] came up. At the time <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> it, and we took it." [...] The two regularly performed at Café Joel, a small coffeehouse their church had started where Meany was music director. These performances helped cultivate their unique sound and introduced them to future band member David Rumsey.|$|E

500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Smith's {{personal}} favourite is {{the cover}} recorded by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr., which was released {{as a single}} in the UK in 1989 (and 1990 in the US). Dinosaur Jr.'s version has a faster tempo and showcases the band's loud and distortion-heavy sound. The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when we finished it <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> it so much we didn't {{want to give it}} to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a cover version before or since", and even said the cover has [...] "influenced how we play it live".|$|E
500|$|The season {{one episode}} [...] "Death" [...] heavily {{influenced}} the film's screenplay. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around {{the parents of}} South Park protesting about Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, [...] "After about {{the first year of}} South Park, Paramount already wanted to make a South Park movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing." [...] During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as [...] "disastrous". As such, they figured the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical.|$|E

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|Evan Gutierrez from AllMusic {{considered}} the record's instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette to be [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "unassuming". Arjona experimented with prominent Latin sounds for Adentro, such as Mexican and Tejano music on [...] "Mojado", {{a duet with}} Mexican band Intocable about immigration. Ricky Muñoz, the vocalist of the group, said that the group met Arjona in Monterrey, {{and that they were}} in contact with Arjona through Carlos Cabral, one of Adentro producers, who had also worked with them formerly. Muñoz additionally reflected: [...] "We admire Arjona. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> the song and then we recorded it [...] It is very cool that he invited us [...]" [...] "Adiós Melancolía" [...] is mainly composed as a bachata song with Colombian influences. [...] "No Te Cambio Por Nada" [...] is intermittently rock-dabbled. The lyrics of [...] "De Vez En Mes" [...] pertain to a woman's menstruation.|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{warns against}} such {{misplaced}} values and condemns {{the practice of}} censorship, as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like South Park or Terrance and Phillip. The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere. The plot of [...] "Death" [...] heavily influenced the screenplay Parker and Stone wrote for their 1999 film, [...] The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around the parents of South Park protesting Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children.

500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone pursued {{other films}} of his own, Chernin was {{replaced}} by Thomas Rothman, and a drunken Sellers crashed his car, killing a much-loved colleague and earning jail time, while producers Murphy and Hamsher were paid off. [...] "After they got rid of us, they brought on Chris Columbus", Murphy stated. [...] "Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing, which didn't make much sense." [...] Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought Sam Hamm, his co-writer on an unproduced Fantastic Four script, to write the screenplay. [...] "We tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to the elements <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> from the five films, and would also incorporate {{a lot of material}} [...] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production," [...] Hamm continued. [...] "The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book, {{but a lot of the}} stuff in the second half comes directly from it, or directly inspired by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone {{through a lot of}} personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is just the best that it can be from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} two suicide falls, the {{miniature}} New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along {{the heights of}} the buildings. McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds, but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty. Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots {{would be more effective}} with a wide-angle lens. [...] "The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens, but as we tried a 14 mm lens, and then a 10 mm, <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> the shots more and more." [...] However, the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the model city, leaving empty spaces with no buildings. In the end, extra buildings were created from putting the one-sided buildings together and placing them at the edges. Charles Durning's fall was shot conventionally, but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera, his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera.|$|E
500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, {{if you really want to}} get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how <b>we</b> <b>liked,</b> on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to think about doing a story {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we said maybe we can do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E
