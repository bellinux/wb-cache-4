5|$|Amy rescues Sonic from {{imprisonment}} {{and asks}} him {{to marry her}} but yet again Sonic refuses to in Sonic Adventure 2. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then spends much of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E
5|$|When Buffy is on patrol, she laments in {{song about}} how uninspired her life has become ("Going Through the Motions"). The {{next morning at}} the Magic Box, the gang reveal that they also sang that evening. Led by Giles, the gang theorizes about {{the cause of the}} singing; they sense no {{immediate}} danger but agreeing that by working together they can overcome anything ("I've Got a Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together"). Buffy learns that the whole town is affected <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer David Fury) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service got their stains out ("The Mustard").|$|E
25|$|Peggy is then {{kidnapped by}} Charlie, leaving {{everyone}} at the Lodge thinking that the ritual worked. He tells her that he told his dad that he gave up singing and was given 10% of the business so he can support her. He then proposes and gives her the locket she wore {{at the beginning of}} the film. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> inside, she sees baby pictures of her and Charlie, which resemble their children. Peggy sees how much he loves her and how much she loves him, and they kiss. They begin to make love, which would again lead to Peggy getting pregnant and marrying him. In the next moment, Peggy is transported back to 1985.|$|E

500|$|Debra is {{insecure}} in {{her relationship}} with Gabriel because her ex-fiancé Brian Moser, the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", kidnapped and tried to kill her. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> through Gabriel's e-mail, she sees that he has sent a book titled The Ice Princess {{to a number of}} publishers. She assumes that the book is about her and angrily breaks up with him. Discussing the break-up with FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine), he gives her the background check that he had run on Gabriel, revealing that Gabriel is a children's writer, and Debra realizes that The Ice Princess is a children's book.|$|E
500|$|The Orphanage was {{received}} very well by American critics on its original release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics {{had given the}} film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 168. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 74, based on 33 reviews. Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be [...] "deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, a sense of place, a sympathy with the characters, instead of rushing into cheap thrills". Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting, [...] "Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed {{in the context of}} Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even explainable (or not)." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote, [...] "The year's best horror picture {{is also one of the}} simplest. The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors." [...] The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull. Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos, saying [...] "Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos, but he isn't given that much to do". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying, [...] "Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> one way and then the other, while skulking through the hallways of her childhood home, every nerve-wracking whatwasthat? registers, and how. Cayo is pretty dull by comparison, but Chaplin certainly is not." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail praised Rueda stating, [...] "The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding, intense performance by Spanish actress, Belen Rueda." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Bai {{claimed that}} she is from the moon, where her {{grandmother}} lives. [...] "I'm not really in reality. I'm in my own universe and my mind is a million miles somewhere else," [...] she stated, further explaining, [...] "Why I feel like I come from the moon is because {{my mother told me}} I was found somewhere." [...] She believes that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> up at the moon, she can often spot her grandmother there, still living in her childhood home.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 Evans {{returned}} to the film studios after an absence of more than thirty years. At the instigation of Emlyn Williams she appeared in The Last Days of Dolwyn. The cast included Williams, Richard Burton, in his first film, and Allan Aynesworth, who had created the role of Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest in 1895. This was Aynesworth's last film; Evans went on to make eighteen more {{over the next three}} decades. She played an elderly Welsh woman, and was well received by reviewers, although one wondered if she was yet quite at home before the camera: [...] "there are indeed moments <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> as disproportionate as a life-size Rembrandt in a one-room flatlet. But it is not, of course, the flatlet which stays in the memory". In the same year she played Countess Ranevskaya in Thorold Dickinson's film version of The Queen of Spades.|$|E
2500|$|Michael {{reveals that}} he wants her {{to go with him}} and another woman to Utah (where {{polygamy}} is legal) so they can marry and support him while he writes. After his revelation, she tells him he should go and to write about their night together. In the middle of their conversation, she hears a voice she recognizes singing. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at the stage, she sees that it is Charlie and realizes that she did not know everything about him. Michael is upset, thinking that she declined his offer for Charlie and is ready to go. After they leave, Charlie is auditioning for a music agent and is rejected. The next day when Peggy goes to talk to Charlie, he lashes out at her and she gives him a song she [...] "wrote" [...] for him (which ends up being [...] "She Loves You", by The Beatles). She then goes to Richard to say goodbye, saying she wants to stop messing up her life and everyone else's since the reason Charlie stopped singing was her becoming pregnant right before they graduated. Richard proposes, but she refuses because she does not want to marry anyone and he has to be valedictorian. Confused, she visits her grandparents for her birthday. After her grandparents tell her that her grandmother can see the future, she tells them her story. Her grandfather and his lodge friends then try a strange séance ritual to send her back to 1985.|$|E
60|$|Nancy (who has a fine appetite) looked pleased. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> pleased, {{she looks}} nice. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> nice, I chuck her under the chin. It isn't immorality--it's only habit.|$|E
