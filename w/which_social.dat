He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and <b>which</b> <b>social</b> problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E

The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on <b>which</b> <b>social</b> group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E

5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened {{to the outside world}} in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in <b>which</b> <b>social</b> life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E

25|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{examines}} the nature of online social interactions, and the way in <b>which</b> <b>social</b> media has changed how people, particularly younger people, connect with one another. Turkle argues that because people in interpersonal social situations, particularly young people, are often distracted by their phones, they will pay insufficient attention to one another, creating increasingly shallow relationships. Turkle argues that teenagers' reliance on friends' advice prevents self-reflection, leading to less personal independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree to}} <b>which</b> <b>social</b> origin affects these {{preferences}} surpasses both educational and economic capital. Demonstrably, at equivalent levels of educational capital, social origin remains an influential {{factor in determining}} these dispositions. How one describes one’s social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development. Also, across the divisions of labor, “economic constraints tend to relax without any {{fundamental change in the}} pattern of spending.” This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability, consumption patterns remain stable.|$|E

25|$|Dewey's {{educational}} theories {{were presented}} in My Pedagogic Creed (1897), The School and Society (1900), The Child and the Curriculum (1902), Democracy and Education (1916) and Experience and Education (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through <b>which</b> <b>social</b> reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive {{in an environment where}} they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.|$|E
25|$|Sexual pheromones {{are defined}} as odors and {{are one of the}} {{prevalent}} ways in <b>which</b> <b>social</b> male insects find females to mate with. They can be produced in either males or females. The central roles of pheromones are to trigger behavioral interactions between the two sexes. Ultimately, this brings the sexes together for mating purposes. In addition, females discriminate against mates by the judgment of their sex pheromones. Courtship pheromones are issued in many cases by males. In the queen butterfly Danaus gilippus and the Arctic moth Utetheisa ornatrix, the chemical stimulation of the female is necessary for male mating success.|$|E
25|$|As a middle-range {{theoretical}} platform, social complexity can {{be applied}} to any research in <b>which</b> <b>social</b> interaction or the outcomes of such interactions can be observed, but particularly where they can be measured and expressed as continuous or discrete data points. One common criticism often cited regarding the usefulness of complexity science in sociology is the difficulty of obtaining adequate data. Nonetheless, application of the concept of social complexity and the analysis of such complexity has begun and continues to be an ongoing field of inquiry in sociology. From childhood friendships and teen pregnancy to criminology and counter-terrorism, theories of social complexity are being applied in almost all areas of sociological research.|$|E

25|$|A second {{exception}} {{is to be}} found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings. This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to <b>which</b> <b>social</b> science can address the content of legal practice.|$|E
25|$|The mate {{deprivation}} hypothesis {{alludes to}} the concept that the threshold for rape is lowered in males that lack alternative reproductive options. This idea {{is supported by the}} fact that rape is disproportionately committed by men with a lower socioeconomic status. However, Malamuth found a relationship between low socioeconomic status and a rearing environment in <b>which</b> <b>social</b> relationships were not committed, which in turn resulted in a male’s reduced ability to form enduring relationships in later life. This subsequently results in less alternative reproductive options. Therefore, while there is indeed a relationship between a lack of alternative reproductive options and rape behaviour, there are likely to be a number of co-morbid factors affecting this correlation, leading Thornhill and Palmer to conclude that the idea of a specific psychological adaptation that motivated men with a lack of sexual access to females is unlikely, and that further research need be conducted.|$|E
25|$|Students {{enrolled}} {{in one of}} the undergraduate programs of the Faculty of Social Sciences can earn a degree with a certification through one of the collaborative programs with local colleges. There are 11 Collaborative programs in <b>which</b> <b>social</b> science majors can choose from; Behavioural Science, Child and Youth Workers, Contemporary Labour Studies, Emergency Management, Film Studies, Geomatics, Journalism, Paralegal, Policing and Criminal Justice, Public Relations and Yukon College. Applications must be submitted after completion of their first year of study maintaining a 70% average. Students spend their first, second and fourth year at Brock while their third is spent at the preferred local college. For example, Media and Communication students can enrol in their third year of study in the Public Relations collaborative program with Mohawk College. This allows students to end their undergraduate with a certification of Public Relations and a Bachelor of Arts in four years rather than five if done consecutively. Students who complete this program tend to go into the government sector, private agencies, corporations and/or non-profit.|$|E

'Relative Size: According to Goffman, {{relative}} size can {{be defined}} as “one way in <b>which</b> <b>social</b> weight–power, authority, rank, office, renown- is echoed expressively in social situations through relative size, especially height”. With relative size, women are generally shown smaller or lower than men in terms of girth and height. Although men tend to be biologically taller or larger than females, Goffman suggests that this size difference is manipulated in man-made advertisements to convey difference in status or power in certain social situations. The concept that relative size conveys social status remains relevant even when women are portrayed as the taller or larger individual on screen or in print. Goffman states that on the few occasions when women are pictured taller than men, the men seem almost always to be subordinated in social class status and/or depicted as inferior.|$|E
