Lewis then learns that Gloria is not ill and she and Gail were testing his loyalty to Audrey. Lewis is outraged when he realises Audrey knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> breaks up with her. He then gets revenge on Gloria by revealing that she has cheated in the local pub of the year competition. Lewis gets his job back at The Bistro and he moves into a flat on Victoria Street. Lewis begins to formulate a plan {{to get back at}} Gail for ruining his relationship with Audrey. He decides to use her guilt against her. One night at the Bistro, he pretends to slip and hurt his back. Gail takes pity on Lewis and allows him to stay with her, while she cares for him. During his time with Gail, Lewis offers her his support and advice about her problems. Lewis is not happy when he sees Audrey on a date with another man.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 2016, several {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} White Water Landing ride. The ride operator was {{not paying attention}} and started the ride without putting the restraint bars down. As the raft ascended the lift hill, the onboard guests started to panic and started yelling at the ride operators. One of the passengers stood up, {{trying to get the}} ride operator's attention. Soon after this, one of the ride operators realized <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> stopped the ride.

25|$|Cicero {{understood}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, {{to oppose}} every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing {{that this could}} result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope {{the whole of the}} senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not want to appear to have instigated Clodius or to be pleased with his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve anything if he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar was giving him bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E

[...] As they advanced, the British light troops signalled with bugle calls, which to Colonel Joseph Reed were {{reminiscent of a}} fox hunt, and seemed to him to be intended as an insult. [...] Probably about this time, the Second and Third battalions of British light infantry, along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements. Reed, who had met Knowlton, rode to Washington to tell him <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> encouraged him to reinforce the rangers. Instead of retreating, Washington, in what Edward G. Lengel calls [...] "an early glimmer of the courage and resolve that would rally the Continentals from many a tight spot later on", [...] devised a plan to entrap the British light troops. Washington would have some troops make a feint, in order to draw the British down into an area of open ground known as 'The Hollow Way', and then send a detachment of troops around to trap the British.|$|E

500|$|Sometime around September 19, 1869, Corbin, at {{the urging}} of Gould, sent a letter to Grant desperately urging him not to release gold from the Treasury.

He finally realized <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> was determined to stop the gold manipulation scheme.

Grant, however, did have his wife Julia respond in a letter to Corbin's wife that Abel Corbin needed to get out of the gold speculation market. When Gould visited Corbin's house, he read the letter from Mrs. Grant containing the warning from Grant, after which he began to sell gold, while also buying small amounts of gold in order to keep people from getting suspicious.

500|$|The exact {{reasons for}} Belcher's {{dismissal}} {{have been a}} recurring subject of scholarly interest, due to the many colonial, imperial, and political factors at play. [...] Two principal themes within these analyses are Belcher's acquisition of many local enemies, {{and the idea that}} good imperial governance in London eventually required his replacement.

500|$|On June 30, Tarrants {{returned}} to Meridian {{to bomb the}} home of Meyer Davidson, an outspoken leader of the Jewish community, on 29th Avenue. The FBI and police chief Roy Gunn convinced Raymond and Alton Wayne Roberts, local Klan members, to gather information about the Klan's operations. Alton was free on bond after being convicted {{in connection with the}} murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in 1964. Leaders of the Jewish communities in Jackson and in Meridian had raised money to pay the two informants, who tipped off the FBI about the attack before it happened. Fifteen police officers were hidden around Davidson's house shortly after midnight when a car stopped about [...] away from the house. Tarrants exited the vehicle with a box, later found to include 29 sticks of dynamite, and approached Davidson's carport. When police ordered him to stop, he dropped the box and fled to his vehicle. Officers then chased him for about 15 blocks before ramming the back of his vehicle, ending the chase. Tarrants opened fire on the policemen with a German-made 9mm submachine gun, striking officer J.M. Hatcher four times in the chest (though critically injured, the officer survived). Tarrants fled through the neighborhood continuing to fire at the policemen. Robert Burton, a resident of the neighborhood, opened his door to see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> was struck by stray bullets. Police eventually found Tarrants in a pool of his own blood in a local resident's backyard. Kathy Ainsworth, a 26-year-old fifth grade school teacher from Jackson who had helped with the bombing of Jackson's synagogue a few months earlier, was found dead in the car with a loaded pistol in her purse. The car's owner was identified to be Danny Joe Hawkins, who had helped bomb Beth Israel; he was arrested on robbery charges a few weeks later. Tarrants survived his wounds and was sentenced to a thirty-year term in Parchman prison. He was paroled eight years into his term to enter the University of Mississippi after a religious conversion, and in 1992 he was training missionaries in North Carolina.|$|E
