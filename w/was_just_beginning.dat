5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the micro-world of biology <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to open up. A few lensmakers and natural {{philosophers}} had been creating crude microscopes {{since the late}} 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But {{it was not until}} Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E

Since Brazil lacked a large native population, and the Indians did not make good plantation workers, the Portuguese colonists began to import African slaves to work their plantations. The first slaves, from the region of Guinea, arrived in Brazil in 1539. Most of them worked in the sugarcane fields or served as house servants.|$|E
