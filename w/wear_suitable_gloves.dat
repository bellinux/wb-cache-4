50|$|In combat sports, {{victory is}} {{obtained}} from blows, punches or attacks {{to the head}} {{to a point of}} physical injury that the opponent is unable to continue. Different forms of combat sport have different rules and regulations into the equipment competitors have to wear. In Amateur boxing seen at the Olympics, competitors are permitted to wear head guards and correctly weighted padded gloves, mouth guards are optional and the canvas floor protection from a hard fall. In sports such as Taekwondo, competitors are permitted to wear a trunk protector, head guard, gloves, groin guard and shin and forearm pads. Professional boxing and UFC are two of the most dangerous combat sports in the world {{due to the lack of}} protective gear worn. Competitors in these two sports have the option to wear a mouthguard and must <b>wear</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>gloves.</b> The lack of protective clothing makes competitors vulnerable to concussion and further traumatic head injuries. A scientific experiment, conducted last year by Dr Andrew McIntosh of ACRISP at the Federation University of Australia, tested the impact of 7 different head guards in combat sport. The results of the experiment revealed the benefits of the combination of a glove and headguard in maximising the impact energy attenuation. A study conducted by Lystad showed that combat sports with little to no protective gear such as MMA or boxing has an injury incidence rate range of 85.1-280.7 per 1000 athletes in comparison to another striking combat sport like Taekwondo which has a large amount of protective gear such as pads, headgear, mouth guard and gloves, has an injury incidence rate range of 19.1-138.8 per 1000 athletes. This means that injury rates are drastically lowered when protective gear is used.|$|E
40|$|Perchloric acid (ClHO 4) is {{a strong}} {{corrosive}} mineral acid. It is a colourless, odourless, oily liquid that is very hygroscopic (i. e., it absorbs moisture from the air). It is an oxidizing agent. At high concentrations or when it comes in contact with organic or combustible material, it presents an explosion hazard. The purpose of this safety notice is to provide information on the safe handling and storage of perchloric acid. PERCHLORIC ACID CONCENTRATIONS UP TO 72. 5 % In concentrations up to 72. 5 % and when used at room temperature, ClHO 4 is normally stable. Precautions for using perchloric acid under these conditions {{are similar to those}} for other mineral acids: <b>Wear</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>gloves,</b> chemical splash and impact goggles, and other protective clothing to protect in the event of splashes and spills. Dilute only by adding perchloric acid slowly to water while stirring, not the other way around. Limit quantities in storage to what is needed for the next 6 - 12 months.

40|$|Introduction: Cement {{has long}} been known as a cause of both {{irritant}} and allergic contact dermatitis. However, there are little data relating to occupational skin diseases (OSD) in the Iranian construction industry. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the epidemiology of cement dermatitis among terrazzo and cement manufactory workers. Methods: This is cross-sectional descriptive study. In this study 50 cement manufact-ory workers in Shahroud and 150 terrazzo workers in Lordegan were interviewed through questionnaire. Questionnaire includes demographic characteristics and questions about present dermatitis, background eczema, daily work hours, exposed chemical agents, using of gloves. Patients examined and patch tested by dermatologist. Data analyzed with SPSS software and c 2, Mann Whitney and logistic regression statistical test. Results: The findings of the study showed that 8 workers (16 %) in cement factories and 52 workers (34. 7 %) in Lordegan terrazzo enterprises had reported dermatitis at the time of review. Of which 15. 5 % in terrazzo workers had allergic contact dermatitis. In this study the prevalence of cement dermatitis increased with increasing age and there was significantly differences between dermatitis and background of dermatitis in terrazzo workers (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Cement should be treated as hazardous materials, <b>wearing</b> of <b>suitable</b> <b>gloves,</b> early diagnosis and treatment of contact dermatitis and health education to workers is suggested...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to review the literature on the methods that have been considered appropriate for evaluation of the effects of gloves on different aspects of hand performance, to make recommendations for the testing and assessment of gloves, and to identify where {{further research is needed to}} improve the evaluation protocols. Eighty-five papers meeting the criteria for inclusion were reviewed. Many studies show that gloves may have negative effects on manual dexterity, tactile sensitivity, handgrip strength, muscle activity and fatigue and comfort, while further research is needed to determine glove effects on pinch strength, forearm torque strength and range of finger and wrist movements. The review also highlights several methodological issues (including consideration of both task type and duration of glove use by workers, guidance on the selection and allocation of <b>suitable</b> <b>glove(s)</b> for particular tasks/jobs, and glove design features) that need to be considered in future research...|$|R
25|$|Swimming was {{not only}} a sport for the {{residents}} of Victorian East London, Eastern Cape, but due to periodic water shortages, sometimes a necessity. From 1873 the town council promulgated measures to control swimming hours, apparel and especially separate swimming areas for men and women. These regulations were too conservative and constraining for the taste of the residents of this coastal town and for several decades they were the subject of legal battles, or were simply ignored. The dispute was finally settled in 1906 when mixed bathing was permitted with the proviso that both men and women should <b>wear</b> <b>suitable</b> swimming costumes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Apart from generic {{guidelines}} for the safe handling of cytotoxic drugs in pharmacy departments, there is no specific published literature pertaining to cleaning procedures and inadvertent exposure to paclitaxel. Aim: To examine occupational exposure to paclitaxel; to identify an effective decontamination reagent; and to determine <b>suitable</b> <b>glove</b> type for skin protection. Method: 8 decontamination reagents were tested for paclitaxel degradation. Air sampling filters, Ghost Wipes and cotton wipes were tested under different storage conditions (room temperature, ≤ 4 °C) for 3 days. Disposable latex and nitrile gloves were tested for paclitaxel permeation using a one-inch ASTM standard test cell. Environmental (airborne and surface) monitoring {{was carried out in}} the cytotoxic compounding and work areas. High performance liquid chromatography and photo-ionisation detector were used for sample analysis and glove permeation tests, respectively. Results: Isopropanol 50 % and ethanol 60 % demonstrated the least degradation (99 %) of paclitaxel in 20 minutes. Sample wipes should be stored at ≤ 4 °C until analysis. Paclitaxel and sodium hypochlorite 0. 5 % w/v did not permeate through the latex and nitrile gloves after 4 hours of continuous exposure. No paclitaxel was detected in airborne and surface wipe samples. Conclusion: No detectable paclitaxel was measured within the cytotoxic compounding area. Sodium hypochlorite 0. 5 % w/v is a suitable decontamination reagent for paclitaxel surface contamination. Wearing either latex or nitrile gloves can prevent contamination when handling paclitaxel.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of failure in unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) is polyethylene wear. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and assess a novel Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) -based method for the measurement of linear <b>wear</b> <b>suitable</b> for UKR. Model-based RSA was used to estimate the linear wear of polyethylene bearings in UKR. A phantom was used to validate the method using in vitro measured bearing thicknesses and the linear wear of ten control bearings was estimated in vivo. Computer aided design (CAD) models for the UKRs were used in the model-based RSA system. There was no statistically significant difference between the estimated and measured bearing thicknesses using the CAD models (p = 0. 386). The precision of the linear wear measurement, expressed as the standard deviation of the difference between the estimated and measured bearing thickness was 0. 163 mm. The bias (mean difference) was 0. 030 mm. The use of RSA to measure in vivo wear in a UKR has been shown to be accurate in a phantom, and has been verified with in vivo measured controls. The technique does not require surgical implantation of marker balls and can be used retrospectively...|$|R
