5|$|In January 2001, Kabila {{was shot}} dead inside his palace. The Congolese {{government}} claimed Kabila {{had been killed by}} a rogue bodyguard, who was himself killed at the scene. According to a report published in French newspaper Le Monde, Kabila was killed by the kadogo, an army of child soldiers he was known to have assembled during the First Congo War. The kadogo had suffered badly during the battles in Kasai and Katanga, were poorly paid, and had become alienated by Kabila. Kabila's son Joseph was appointed president and immediately began asserting his authority by dismissing his father's cabinet and senior army commanders, assembling a new government, and engaging <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community.</b> The new government provided impetus for renewed peace negotiations, and in July 2002 a peace agreement was reached between Rwanda, Congo, and the other major participants, in which all foreign troops would withdraw and RCD-Goma would enter a power-sharing transitional government with Joseph Kabila as interim president until elections could be held. By the end of 2002, all uniformed Rwandan troops had left Congolese territory.|$|E

Many countries have expressed concern that Iran's nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program.

25|$|The North Korean leaders {{understood}} {{the importance of}} sports {{not only in the}} international community, but also internally. The major ideology in North Korea, Juche, has been solidified through the Communist Party's use of sports. The North Korea regime believed that by supporting the increases in sport, the North Korean people would overall be more fit. This would allow the people to be more useful in the revolutionary struggle. For this reason, it was important to start athletics young. In fact, training in physical sport was mandatory during schooling. In the 2000s, major sporting events were being broadcast throughout North Korea, and these events are still being used as propaganda tools. Sports have played a vital role in maintaining the power of the ruling class, {{while at the same time}} offering opportunities to interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

In the 1966 World Cup, North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team. Kim Jong-il believed that successful athletics increases {{the strength of a}} country, promoted its ideology, brought a country great honor and increased its international reputation. For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the 2010 World Cup. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during 2006 World Cup qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in Thailand without any fans.|$|E

It proposes an approach to understanding states and their roles, drawing on ideas of institutions and their rules {{as a means of}} mediating power, and applies this to a discussion of two 'state-building' initiatives at the subnational level in Afghanistan. It shows how resistance to attempts to impose 'bureaucratic rules', coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community's</b> failure to understand the role of states in mediating power, has contributed to the failure to date of interventions to reform local government. This has directly affected reconstruction and stability in Afghanistan. ...|$|R

25|$|From 1919, Afghanistan was in {{the midst}} of a reformation period under Amanullah Khan. Afghan Foreign Minister Mahmud Tarzi was a {{follower}} of Mustafa Kemal's domestic policy. He encouraged Amanullah Khan in social and political reform but urged that reforms should build upon the basis of a strong government. During the late 1920s, Anglo-Afghan relations soured over British fears of an Afghan-Soviet friendship. On 20 May 1928, Anglo-Afghan politics gained a positive perspective, when Amanullah Khan and the Queen were received by Mustafa Kemal in Constantinople. This meeting was followed by a Turkey-Afghanistan Friendship and Cooperation pact on 22 May 1928. Mustafa Kemal supported Afghanistan's integration into international organizations. In 1934, Afghanistan's relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community</b> gained a huge boost when it joined the League of Nations. In 1937, King Zahir Shah became a signatory of the Treaty of Saadabad. Mahmud Tarzi received Mustafa Kemal's personal support until he died on 22 November 1933 in Istanbul.|$|E
500|$|To reengage <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community,</b> and to {{deal with}} the {{economic}} challenges brought by the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Vietnamese leaders decided to embark on a series of reforms. At the 6th National Party Congress in December 1986, newly appointed General Secretary of the VCP Nguyen Van Linh introduced a major reform known as Doi Moi, the Vietnamese term for [...] "renovation", in order to fix Vietnam’s economic problems. However, Vietnamese leaders concluded that Vietnam’s dire economic situation came {{as a result of the}} international isolation which followed its invasion of Kampuchea in 1978, and that for Doi Moi to be successful it needed radical changes in defence and foreign policy. Subsequently, in June 1987, the Vietnamese Politburo adopted a new defence strategy in Resolution No. 2, calling for the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese soldiers from international duties, a reduction in the size of the army through a discharge of 600,000 soldiers and the establishment of a set ratio for military expenditures.|$|E
500|$|The {{experimental}} rocket-powered aircraft programs {{started by}} NACA were extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This {{was followed by}} a one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program.

Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal [...] "of landing a man on the Moon by the end of , and returning him safely to the Earth." [...] This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>community,</b> which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia.
