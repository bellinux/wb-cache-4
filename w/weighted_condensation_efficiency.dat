30|$|The {{ability of}} these liposomes to {{condense}} DNA was also investigated. Although {{it has been}} suggested that the charge amount, fluidity of membrane and alkyl chain length of lipsome had impact on the DNA <b>condensation</b> and transfection <b>efficiency,</b> the exact mechanisms are not known (Lentz 1993). It is easy to think that the DNA <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> should firstly depend on the Zeta-potential and size of the liposome, which have been unified in this experiment. And secondly, the micro-property of liposomal membrane, including membrane fluidity, intermolecular interaction, molecular density, etc., should be concerned. According to the discussion mentioned above, we focus on the first two. The difference in DNA condensation between Lipo 1 and Lipo 2 could probably be ascribed to the slightly higher fluidity and weaker molecular interaction of the β- than the α-galacto-liposome (Song et al. 2012), which is unfavourable to condense the DNA strand more efficiently. We deduced that the liposomal membrane with higher fluidity (Lipo 2) might hamper the process of DNA adsorption and condensation, leading to decreased DNA <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent ALMA {{observations}} of high-redshift normal galaxies have been providing {{a great opportunity}} to clarify the general origin of dust in the Universe, not biased to very bright special objects even at z> 6. To clarify what constraint we can get for the dust enrichment in normal galaxies detected by ALMA, we use a theoretical model that includes major processes driving dust evolution in a galaxy; that is, dust condensation in stellar ejecta, dust growth by the accretion of gas-phase metals, and supernova destruction. Using the dust emission fluxes detected in two normal galaxies at z> 6 by ALMA as a constraint, we can get the range of the time-scales (or efficiencies) of the above mentioned processes. We find that if we assume extremely high <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> in stellar ejecta (f_in 0. 5), rapid dust enrichment by stellar sources in the early phase may be enough to explain the observed ALMA flux, unless dust destruction by supernovae in those galaxies is stronger than that in nearby galaxies. If we assume a <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> expected from theoretical calculations (f_in 0. 1), strong dust growth (even stronger than assumed for nearby galaxies if they are metal-poor galaxies) is required. These results indicate that the normal galaxies detected by ALMA at z> 6 are biased to objects (i) with high dust <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> in stellar ejecta, (ii) with strong dust growth in very dense molecular clouds, or (iii) with efficient dust growth because of fast metal enrichment up to solar metallicity. A measurement of metallicity is crucial to distinguish among these possibilities. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in the high-z universe, where strongly obscured objects are present, has determined an effort to improve the simulations of dust formation and evolution in galaxies. Three main basic ingredients enter the problem influencing the total dust budget and the mixture of the dust grains: the types and amounts of dust injected by AGB stars and SNae and the accretion/destruction processes of dust in the ISM. They govern the relative abundances of the gas and dust in the ISM. In this study, we focus on star-dust and present a database of <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the refractory elements C, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe in AGB stars and SNae {{that can be easily}} applied to the gaseous ejecta, {{in order to determine the}} amount and kind of refractory elements locally embedded into dust and injected into the ISM. The best theoretical recipes available nowadays in literature to estimate the amount of dust produced by SNae and AGB stars have been discussed and for SNae compared to the observations to get clues on the problem. The <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> have been analyzed in the context of a classical chemical model of dust formation and evolution in the Solar Neighbourhood and Galactic Disk. Tables of coefficients are presented for (i) AGB stars at varying the metallicity and (ii) SNae at varying the density n_H of the ISM where the SNa explosions took place. In particular, we show how the controversial CNT approximation widely adopted to form dust in SNae, still gives good results and agrees with some clues coming from the observations. A new generation of dust formation models in SNae is however required to solve some contradictions recently emerged. A simple database of <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> is set up to be used in chemical models including the effect of dust and meant to simulate galaxies going from primordial proto-galaxies to those currently seen in the local universe.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the effects of {{clumping}} on the emergent spectral energy distribution (SED) from dusty supernova (SN) shells illuminated by a diffuse radiation source distributed throughout the medium. ( [...] .) The fully 3 D radiation transport problem is solved using a Monte Carlo code, MOCASSIN, and we present a set of models aimed at investigating the sensitivity of the SEDs to various clumping parameters. We find that, contrary to the predictions of analytical prescriptions, the combination of an optical and IR observational data set is sufficient to constrain dust masses even in the case where optically thick clumps are present. Using both smoothly varying and clumped grain density distributions, we obtain new estimates for the mass of dust condensed by the Type II SN 1987 A by fitting the optical and infrared spectrophotometric data of Wooden et al. (1993) at two epochs (day 615 and day 775). ( [...] .) From our numerical models we derive dust masses for SN 1987 A that are comparable to previous analytic clumped graphite grain mass estimates, and at least two orders of magnitude below the 0. 1 - 0. 3 Msol that have been predicted to condense as dust grains in primordial core collapse supernova ejecta. This low <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> for SN 1987 A is in contrast to the case of SN 2003 gd, for which a dust <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> as large as 0. 12 has recently been estimated.

40|$|The non-steady-state {{formation}} of small clusters {{and the growth}} of grains accompanied by chemical reactions are formulated under the consideration that the collision of key gas species (key molecule) controls the kinetics of dust formation process. The formula allows us to evaluate the size distribution and <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of dust formed in astrophysical environments. We apply the formulation to the {{formation of}} C and MgSiO 3 grains in the ejecta of supernovae, as an example, to investigate how the non-steady effect influences the formation process, <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> f_{con}, and average radius a_{ave} of newly formed grains in comparison with the results calculated with the steady-state nucleation rate. We show that the steady-state nucleation rate is a good approximation if the collision timescale of key molecule tau_{coll} is much smaller than the timescale tau_{sat} with which the supersaturation ratio increases; otherwise the effect of the non-steady state becomes remarkable, leading to a lower f_{con} and a larger a_{ave}. Examining the results of calculations, we reveal that the steady-state nucleation rate is applicable if the cooling gas satisfies Lambda = tau_{sat}/tau_{coll} > 30 during the formation of dust, and find that f_{con} and a_{ave} are uniquely determined by Lambda_{on} at the onset time t_{on} of dust formation. The approximation formulae for f_{con} and a_{ave} as a function of Lambda_{on} could be useful in estimating the mass and typical size of newly formed grains from observed or model-predicted physical properties not only in supernova ejecta but also in mass-loss winds from evolved stars.

30|$|As what {{discussed}} above, using {{a pair of}} anomeric galactolipids {{we showed}} that their liposomal properties and biofunctions, while incorporated with a DPPE based liposome, were different {{as a result of}} their small configurational difference between α- and β-galacolipid. Galacto-liposomes (Lipo 1 and Lipo 2) showed decreased thermal stability and increased membrnane fluidity, leading to the better DNA <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> probably due to stronger ability to bind and condense DNA chains. And also the all galacto-liposomes, especially Lipo 1, showed better internalization ability than the pure DPPE liposome. We suggest that the elaboration of the structural and functional distinction between isomeric glyco-liposomes should be an important task to address in the field of targeted drug delivery, shedding light on the better understanding of the endocytosis and membrane fusion of these vesicles on the cellular level.|$|R

30|$|If {{there is}} neither {{destruction}} nor accretion growth of dust, the dust-to-gas ratio evolution {{is just the}} metallicity evolution multiplied by the <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of star-dust, ξ, {{as shown by the}} dotted line. We have assumed ξ = 0.1 for this line. Once the SN destruction of dust is turned on with a standard efficiency as ϵmsn = 1 × 103 M⊙ (McKee, 1989; Nozawa et al., 2006), the dust amount is reduced by a factor of ten as shown by the dot-dashed line. This confirms that the dust destruction is very efficient and the stardust injection is too small to compensate for the destruction (e.g., Draine, 1990; Tielens, 1998). Then we need the accretion growth in the ISM to reproduce the dust-togas ratio, ~ 10 − 2, in the present Milky Way. If we assume a time-scale of τac, 0 = 3 × 106 yr, the dust-to-gas-ratio evolution becomes the solid line and reaches ≃ 10 − 2 which, after several Gyr, is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the case without growth.|$|R

Under pH condition of cell culture medium, a strong decrease in siRNA <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> was observed with chitosan nanoparticles.

The search was made using high resolution (R= 50000) optical absorption spectroscopy of a backgound star that probes the envelope on a line of sight 35 " from the center. The metal species that we detect in the envelope include NaI, KI, CaI, CaII, CrI, and FeI, with upper limits for AlI, MnI, TiI, TiII, and SrII. The observations are used to determine the metal abundances in the gas phase and the condensation onto grains. The metal depletions range from a factor of 5 for Na to 300 for Ca, with some similarity to the depletion pattern in interstellar clouds.

We start from the formalism developed by Dwek (1998) to study dust evolution in the solar neighbourhood and extend it to ellipticals and dwarf irregular galaxies, showing how {{the evolution of the}} dust production rates and of the dust fractions depend on the galactic star formation history. The observed dust fractions observed in the solar neighbourhood can be reproduced by assuming that dust destruction depends the condensation temperatures T_c of the elements. In elliptical galaxies, type Ia SNe are the major dust factories in the last 10 Gyr. With our models, we successfully reproduce the dust masses observed in local ellipticals (~ 10 ^ 6 M_sun) by means of recent FIR and SCUBA observations. We show that dust is helpful in solving the iron discrepancy observed in the hot gaseous halos surrounding local ellipticals.

In order to clarify the formation condition of such large Al 2 O 3 grains, we investigate the condensation of Al 2 O 3 grains for wide ranges of the gas density and cooling rate.

Then, we find that the formation of submicron-sized Al 2 O 3 grains requires at least ten times higher gas densities than those presented by one-dimensional SN models. This indicates that presolar Al 2 O 3 grains identified as a SN origin might be formed in dense gas clumps, allowing us to propose that the measured sizes of presolar grains can be a powerful tool to constrain the physical conditions in which they formed. We also briefly discuss the survival of newly formed Al 2 O 3 grains against the destruction in the shocked gas within the SN remnants.

An explicit modelling of dust and molecular hydrogen lifecycles enables the comparison of our models against the observed properties of the ISM, including elemental depletion from the gas-phase. Combining this model with a tidal-dominated paradigm for the formation for the Magellanic Stream and Bridge, we reproduce the age-metallicity relations, long gas depletion timescales, and presently observed dust and molecular hydrogen masses of the MCs to within their respective uncertainties. We find that these models' enrichment depends sensitively on the processing of dust within the ISM and the dynamical influence of external tides/stellar bars. The ratio of characteristic dust destruction timescales in our SMC and LMC models, a governing parameter of our models' evolution, is consistent with estimates based on observed supernova (SN) rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Combination of two {{physical}} phenomena, {{capillary pressure}} gradient and wettability gradient, allows a simple two-step fabrication process that yields a reliable hydrophobic self-cleaning condenser surface. The surface is fabricated with specific microscopic topography and further treatment with a chemically inert low-surface-energy material. This process {{does not require}} growth of nanofeatures (nanotubes) or hydrophilic−hydrophobic patterning of the surface. Trapezoidal geometry of the microfeatures facilitates droplet transfer from the Wenzel to the Cassie state and reduces droplet critical diameter. The geometry of the micropatterns enhances local coalescence and directional movement for droplets with diameter {{much smaller than the}} radial length of the micropatterns. The hydrophobic self-cleaning micropatterned condenser surface prevents liquid film formation and promotes continuous dropwise condensation cycle. Upon dropwise condensation, droplets follow a designed wettability gradient created with micropatterns from the most hydrophobic to the least hydrophobic end of the surface. The surface has higher <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency,</b> due to its directional self-cleaning property, than a plain hydrophobic surface. We explain the self-actuated droplet collection mechanism on the condenser surface and demonstrate experimentally the creation of an effective wettability gradient over a 6 mm radial distance.

In EtBr exclusion assays, the steady-state fluorescence spectra of EtBr were decomposed into the sum of two lognormal emissions, emanating from two different environments – H 2 O and DNA, and the effect of charge ratio (+/-) was observed. 90 º SLS assays gave an important contribution, detecting size variations in systems with different MO fractions on the lipoplexes.

We include condensation of dust in stellar ejecta, the growth of dust in the interstellar medium (ISM), the destruction of dust by supernovae and in the hot halo, and dusty winds and inflows. The rate of dust growth in the ISM depends on the metallicity and density of molecular clouds. Our fiducial model reproduces the relation between dust mass and stellar mass from z= 0 to z= 7, the number density of galaxies with dust masses less than 10 ^ 8. 3 M_, and the cosmic density of dust at z= 0. The model accounts for the double power-law trend between dust-to-gas (DTG) ratio and gas-phase metallicity of local galaxies and the relation between DTG ratio and stellar mass. The dominant mode of dust formation is dust growth in the ISM, except for galaxies with M_*< 10 ^ 7 M_, where condensation of dust in supernova ejecta dominates.

40|$|The {{importance}} of supernovae {{as a source}} of interstellar dust has long been debated. Theoretical models predict that the final event {{in the life of a}} massive star (10 [...] 30 Modot) should produce 0. 3 [...] 5 Modot of dust. If this were true, then TypeII supernovae would be significant contributors to the ISM dust budget. In the early universe, this is particularly important, as the other major sources of dust (low-intermediate mass AGB stars) do not evolve on a short enough time-scale to produce the quantities of dust now observed at high redshift in the deep submm populations and QSOs. However, observational evidence for such quantities of dust are rather lacking. IRAS and ISO studies of the youngest Galactic supernova remnants detect masses of dust which are > 3 orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by the models. Higher <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> have been attributed to SN 1987 A from the fading of the silicate line, however the high efficiency relies critically on assumptions about the clumpiness of the dust, and there have been no direct measurements of significant dust masses in young supernova remnants until now. Here, we present SCUBA images of a young Galactic supernova remnant at 850 and 450 microns, which show that of order a few solar masses of dust have been produced in the supernovae, or by the massive star progenitor just prior to the explosion...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{demonstration}} of The Mintek Thermal Magnesium Process (MTMP) was achieved in November 2004 at the pilot-scale. About 30 tons of magnesium producing recipe was smelted in the DC arc furnace over a continuous operation of 8 -days. Twenty-two furnace batching-tapping operations {{were carried out}} at a feed rate of 525 kg/h and a smelting temperature of 1600 - 17000 C. The MgO content in the produced slag was as low as 6. 7 %, and averaged 9. 2 % MgO, resulting in an overall magnesium extraction of 77 %, which reached 87 % during good operating periods. Magnesium vapour was extracted {{at a rate of}} 70 - 85 kg/h and was delivered to the condenser that was operated at 680 - 7200 C. The magnesium was captured in the condenser crucible in a liquid state, allowing its prompt tapping. More than 3500 kg of crude metal were produced over 15 on-line metal tapping operations. On average, a <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 85 % was achieved during the entire testwork, which peaked at 87 % during steady operations. The quality of the crude metal was similar to, if not better than, that of the Magnetherm’s crude magnesium. A pre-feasibility study has indicated that the MTMP has the potential for lower capital and operating costs as compared to the electrolytic process, and therefore Mintek and its consortium partners are exploring opportunities for a commercial production facility...|$|R
40|$|Achieving stable, accurate, {{monotone}} {{and efficient}} (SAME) discrete approximate solution is of tremendous interest for convection-dominated {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) applications. Recently, a non-linear SubGrid eMbedded (SGM) finite element basis was developed for generating multidimensional SAME solutions via the weak statement (WS). The theory confirms that only the Navier-Stokes dissipative flux vector term is appropriate for implementing SGM, which thereafter employs element-level static <b>condensation</b> for <b>efficiency</b> and nodal-rank homogeneity. It {{is based on a}} genuinely non-linear, nonhierarchical, high-degree finite element basis for use in a discretized approximation of a WS algorithm. In this paper, the SGM methodology is extended to the Element Free Galerkin (EFG) method...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} {{physicochemical}} properties of some cationic lipophosphoramidates used as gene vectors {{in an attempt}} to better understand the link between the nature of the hydrophobic chain and both physico-chemical properties and transfection efficiency. These compounds have an arsonium head group and various chain lengths and unsaturation numbers. The synthesis of cationic phospholipids with oleic (Guenin et al., 2000 [1]; Floch et al., 2000 [2]) or linoleic (Fraix et al., 2011 [3]; Le Gall et al., 2010 [4]) chains has already been reported by our group and their efficiency as gene carriers has been demonstrated. Four new compounds were synthesized which incorporated either C 14 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 20 : 4 or C 20 : 5 chains. The membrane fluidity was studied by fluorescence anisotropy measurements. The fusion of liposomes and lipoplexes with membrane models was studied by Förster Resonant Energy Transfer. Finally, DNA condensation was studied and the lipoplexes were tested in vitro to quantify their transfection efficiency. From the results obtained on these cationic lipophosphoramidates series, we show that aliphatic chain length and unsaturation number have an important influence on liposomes physicochemical properties and transfection efficiency. However there is no direct link between fluidity and fusion efficiency or between fluidity and DNA condensation. Nevertheless, it seems that for best transfection efficiency the compounds need to combine the properties of fluidity, fusion <b>efficiency</b> and DNA <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This was the case for the C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 2 compounds...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} brightness, gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are viable targets for {{investigating}} the dust content in their host galaxies. Simple intrinsic spectral shapes of GRB afterglows {{allow us to}} derive the dust extinction. Recently, the extinction data of GRB afterglows are compiled up to redshift z= 6. 3, in combination with hydrogen column densities and metallicities. This data set enables us to investigate the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity out to high redshift for a wide metallicity range. By applying our evolution models of dust content in galaxies, {{we find that the}} dust-to-gas ratio derived from GRB afterglow extinction data are excessively high such that they can be explained with a fraction of gas-phase metals condensed into dust (f_in) ∼ 1, while theoretical calculations on dust formation in the wind of asymptotic giant branch stars and in the ejecta of Type II supernovae suggest a much more moderate <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiency</b> (f_in∼ 0. 1). Efficient dust growth in dense clouds has difficulty in explaining the excessive dust-to-gas ratio at metallicities Z/Z_ <ϵ, where ϵ is the star formation efficiency of the dense clouds. However, if ϵ is as small as 0. 01, the dust-to-gas ratio at Z∼ 10 ^- 2 Z_ can be explained with n_H≳ 10 ^ 6 cm^- 3. Therefore, a dense environment hosting dust growth is required to explain the large fraction of metals condensed into dust, but such clouds should have low star formation efficiencies to avoid rapid metal enrichment by stars.

40|$|The {{presence}} of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of grains in SN ejecta, {{in accordance with}} current theoretical models. Yet, observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply <b>condensation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first time, the evolution of newly condensed grains {{from the time of}} formation to their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant. We find that 0. 1 - 0. 6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between 2 - 20 % of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on time-scales of about 4 - 8 x 10 ^ 4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z = 6. 2. Stochastic heating of small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports the idea that large amounts (~ 0. 1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40 K) can be present in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission. Comment: MNRAS accepte...|$|R
