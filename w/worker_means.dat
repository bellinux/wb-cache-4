A labour recruiter can be either public or private and offers labour recruitment services. These businesses profit from the recruitment of migrants workers from one country and their allocation in jobs in another. Agents charge fees and commission for their services to migrant domestic workers. Sri Lankan migrant domestic worker pay an estimated $1300–1600 to a Lebanese agent while potential workers in the Philippines and Ethiopia pay between $2,400-3500 and $1,700-2100 respectively. [...] The Lebanese agent will also earn anything between $300 and 600 in commission in addition. This money covers travel costs, Lebanese government visa fees, and the agency fee. In some cases, the first three months' salary is signed away as payment. The agency fees {{cover the cost of}} airfare, government charges for issue of visas and agency commissions. The residency, work permit, notary fee and annual insurance are not included in the initial sum and are the responsibility of the employer sum which is calculated to US$500. There is a difference in the amount the agency receives for each group of workers depending on their country of origin. One example is the migrant workers from the Philippines who demand higher costs and monthly salaries because they have a good command of English, both spoken and written. They are deemed better educated and therefore are given a higher respect as maids than those from other countries. Some employment agencies contract migrant domestic worker out on short-term contracts at a cost of up to $450 per month. The high prices involved in recruiting a migrant domestic <b>worker</b> <b>means</b> that employers take precautions to make sure the worker does not leave their position before their contract is up. The migrant domestic worker is also required to make a deposit of $1,000 in a Lebanese back in order to cover return ticket home, which is never available to the worker. Because of the conditions present in Lebanon, legal and illegal agencies flourish and due to the Kafala system a migrant has to rely on agencies to find a Lebanese sponsor and employer.|$|E

30|$|As {{positions}} disappear, {{the rate}} at which workers arrive at employers rises, but {{the rate at}} which workers find new vacancies drops. As noted above, the higher arrival rate of workers at vacancies lowers the cost of discriminating, because a faster arrival of the next <b>worker</b> <b>means</b> less foregone output when a type B worker is turned away 14. This lowers the cutoff value of c*, which in turn lowers the value of search for type B workers relative to type A workers. A similar effect results from disproportionately more type A than type B workers losing jobs, raising the share of type A workers among the searchers and lowering the expected waiting time for the next type A applicant for firms who turn away type B workers. The lower arrival rate of job offers to workers lowers the value of search for both type A and type B workers, which lowers the wage of both types; but it lowers the value of search more for type A workers. This decreases the wage gap, but is a rather subtle, non-intuitive effect, as are the impacts of the many of the subsequent equilibrating reactions of the model’s variables to the initial events set in motion by a fall in x.|$|E
40|$|Labour {{scarcity}} and affordability {{have encouraged}} many farmers in Western Australia {{to focus more}} on cropping than sheep production. Many farmers are opting to run low input livestock systems. This paper examines labour demand for sheep and cropping during the production year, combined with various scenarios of labour availability and cost. The implications for farm profitability and enterprise selection are examined using the bio-economic farming systems model MIDAS (Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System). Labour requirements for sheep are far greater than those for cropping. Additionally the labour requirements for sheep are high in all production periods whilst the seasonal nature of cropping means more time is required only at certain times of the year, particularly at seeding and harvest. This means that the most profitable labour option is employing casual labour during periods of peak demand for cropping. The lesser relative profitability of the sheep enterprise makes employing a permanent worker the least profitable labour option. By contrast, employing casual labour during busy periods for cropping is more profitable but it is also associated with only small areas of perennial pastures being sown which has environmental implications. The logistics of employing labour at only certain times of the year compared to employing a full time <b>worker</b> <b>means</b> that farmers need to pay more per week to employ these workers or do the extra work themselves. agriculture, labour, farm modelling, cropping, sheep,...|$|E

We aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season. Methods We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study during the 2006 / 07 influenza season in Berlin, Germany. Recruited participants gave serum samples {{before and after the}} season, and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors. The main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection (SCII), defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza (with post-season titre at least 1 : 40). Weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors. Results We recruited 250 hospital healthcare <b>workers</b> (<b>mean</b> age 35. 7 years) and 486 non-healthcare <b>workers</b> (<b>mean</b> age 39. 2 years) from administrative centres, blood donors and colleges. Overall SCII attack rate was 10. 6 %. Being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for SCII (relative risk 1. 1, p = 0. 70). The final multivariate model had three significant factors: living with children (odds ratio [OR] 3. 7, p = 0. 005), immunization (OR 0. 50, p = 0. 02), and - among persons living in households without children - ownership of a car (OR 3. 0, p = 0. 02).

In Romania, gross {{domestic}} product dropped from a total of € 48. 75 billion in 1989 to € 40. 28 billion in 2000, and after 2002 a significant increase reached over € 79 billion in 2005. The overall {{decrease in the number}} of employed persons by 2. 56 million people, between 1989 and 2005, led to an increase in productivity of around € 1, 222 per employed person – representing 28. 4 % of the total productivity increase.

Time and frequency domain indices of HRV were only derived during nighttime sleep, and used as markers of cardiac autonomic modulation.

The intensity of current mercury vapor exposure was rather moderate as reflected by the mean (geometric) levels of mercury in blood (2. 4 micrograms/dl) and in urine (63 micrograms/g creatinine). The hand steadiness test and eye-hand coordination test revealed preclinical alterations in postural and intentional tremor, whereas the changes evidenced by the accelerometer test were not statistically significant. Furthermore the practical advantage of the psychomotor tests over the accelerometer test makes them most appropriate for the early detection of mercury-induced hand tremor.
