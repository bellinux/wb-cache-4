5|$|Anna Komnene {{described}} the proceedings with very repetitive details, with Bohemond frequently pointing {{out his own}} mistakes and praising the benevolence of Alexios and the Empire; the proceedings must have been rather humiliating for Bohemond. On the other hand, Anna's work <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to praise her father and {{the terms of the}} treaty may not be entirely accurate.|$|E

5000|$|According to Cebrowski, [...] "Defense Transformation is {{foremost}} {{a continuing}} process. It {{does not have}} an end point. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to create or anticipate the future. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to deal with the co-evolution of concepts, processes, organizations and technology. Change in any one of these areas necessitates change in all. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to create new competitive areas and new competencies. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to identify, leverage and even create new underlying principles for the way things are done. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to identify and leverage new sources of power. The overall objective of these changes is simply—sustained American competitive advantage in warfare." ...|$|R
5|$|Bond {{receives}} a spear gun-armed underwater jet pack scuba (allowing the frogman to manoeuvre faster than other frogmen). Designed by Jordan Klein, green dye <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> {{to be used}} by Bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers. Instead Ricou Browning, the film's underwater director, used it to make Bond's arrival more dramatic.|$|E
5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre as an indication that Prospero <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, when Germany {{attacked}} Great Britain, the United States {{feared that}} if Germany controlled Great Britain, Mexico and the U.S. would be next. In the same year, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered {{the construction of}} a naval base in the Atlantic similar to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The site <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to provide anchorage, docking, repair facilities, fuel, and supplies for 60% of the Atlantic Fleet. The naval base, which was named U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, became the largest naval installation in the world in landmass and <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be the Pearl Harbor of the Atlantic. However, with the defeat of Germany in 1945, the United States concentrated all of their efforts to the war in the Pacific. In May 2003, after six decades of existence, the base was officially shut down by the U.S. Navy.|$|E

60|$|All such phrases {{as these}} must appear {{of course to}} {{overstate}} the case. Pip {{is a much more}} delightful person than Nicholas Nickleby. Or to take a stronger case for the purpose of our argument, Pip is a much more delightful person than Sydney Carton. Still the fact remains. Most of Nicholas Nickleby's personal actions <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show that he is heroic. Most of Pip's actions <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show that he is not heroic. The study of Sydney Carton <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to indicate that with all his vices Sydney Carton was a hero. The study of Pip <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to indicate that with all his virtues Pip was a snob. The motive of the literary explanation is different. Pip and Pendennis <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show how circumstances can corrupt men. Sam Weller and Hercules <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show how heroes can subdue circumstances.|$|R
5|$|James Gilbert {{had seen}} film actor Bill Owen playing {{northern}} {{characters in the}} Royal Court Theatre and proposed to cast him as Compo Simmonite. Clarke, who initially saw Owen as an archetypal cockney who could not play as solid a northern character as Compo <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be, recognised Owen's potential only after going to London for a read-through with him.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{wrote about}} the deeds of Odaenathus; Nicostratus of Trebizond {{probably}} accompanied the king on his campaigns and wrote a history of that period starting from Philip the Arab and ending shortly before the king's death. According to Potter, Nicostratus' account <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to glorify Odaenathus and demonstrate his superiority over Roman emperors.|$|E
5|$|Michael again {{searches}} for his runaway father, George Sr. Gob receives {{an invitation to}} a father/son reunion outing, and believes it to be George Sr. trying to contact him.

Meanwhile, George Michael and Maeby deal with their previous kiss by avoiding each other.|$|E

5|$|On February 14, 2008 a typo {{in court}} papers filed by Federal {{prosecutors}} erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run.

5|$|One of the Green's {{earliest}} uses was as {{a pasture}} for cattle belonging to {{the residents of the}} town. Dartmouth students resented this use, and in the early 19th century herded all the cattle into the basement of Dartmouth Hall as a protest. The fence constructed during the 1836 renovations was in part a response to this action, and <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to keep animals out.|$|E
5|$|Sang Pencerah, {{produced}} {{to coincide}} with Muhammadiyah's centenary, was announced in November 2009. It <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be historically accurate, {{with much of the}} Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) budget paying for period costumes and sets. However, as documentation on the early years of Dahlan's life is lacking, those scenes were fictionalised. Sang Pencerah marks the feature film debut of Ihsan Tarore and Giring Ganesha.|$|E

5|$|The Analytical Review <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to {{enlighten}} {{the public as}} well as to simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E
5|$|The FAA {{temporarily}} closed Airway R-20, the {{air corridor}} that Korean Air Flight 007 <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to follow, on September 2.

It was therefore reopened on October 2 after safety and navigational aids were checked.|$|E

5|$|The General Staff {{issued an}} order to attack the Egyptian {{positions}} with a force three battalions strong (from the Givati and Palmach's Negev brigades). The attack <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to {{take place on the}} night of June 1–2, and at about midnight the units involved took up positions from which the assault <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to take off. The 51st Battalion set up positions in the Yavne–Gan Yavne–Hatzor area, the 53rd Battalion—in the Be'er Tuvia–Kfar Warburg area, and the 54th entered a company into the Gedera–Bashit area. At the last minute, the General Staff cancelled the order because of an imminent ceasefire. The ceasefire did not take effect however, and the attack was postponed to the night of June 2–3. The Egyptians discovered the original plan, and were prepared to engage the Israeli forces.|$|E
