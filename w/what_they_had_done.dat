5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E
5|$|The 2/33rd {{remained}} at Mersa Metruh, undertaking defensive duties, until May 1941, {{but did not}} see combat. After this, the 7th Division began to prepare for an invasion of Vichy French-held Syria and Lebanon. A short-lived campaign, from early June until mid-July, the 2/33rd {{took part in the}} fighting around Merdjayoun– attacking Fort Khiam {{in the early stages of}} the campaign– and Jezzine, fighting mainly in disparate company groups. Following the French capitulation, the battalion undertook garrison duties in Lebanon as part of the Allied occupation force established there to defend against a possible German invasion through Turkey; in September the battalion occupied a position around the port of Tripoli. They remained there until early 1942 when the Australian government requested the return of the 7th Division to Australia, following Japan's entry into the war. The battalion's role, and indeed that of the whole 7th Division, in the fighting against the Vichy French was largely censored at the time due to concerns about negative public opinion in Australia and the battalion's historian, William Crooks, notes that later this caused some friction between 7th Division personnel and those from the 6th and 9th Divisions, and a general lack of public awareness of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Casualties sustained by the battalion in Syria and Lebanon numbered 21 dead, 84 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E
5|$|Traveling {{down the}} rows of Austrian battleships, the two men {{encountered}} Viribus Unitis at around 4:40am. Rossetti placed one canister of TNT on the hull of the battleship, timed to explode at 6:30am. He then flooded the second canister, sinking it on the harbor floor close to the ship. This second canister exploded close to the Austrian freighter Wien, resulting in her sinking. The men had no breathing sets, and therefore had to keep their heads above water. They were discovered and taken prisoner just after placing the explosives under the battleship's hull. The two-man team were captured and taken aboard Viribus Unitis, where they informed the new captain of the battleship <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> but did not reveal the exact position of the explosives. Admiral Vuković then arranged for the two prisoners to be taken safely to the sister ship , and ordered the evacuation of the ship. The explosion did not happen at 6:30 as predicted and Vuković returned to the ship with many sailors (believing mistakenly that the Italians had lied). He therefore remained on his ship and went down with her and 300–400 of her crew when the mines exploded shortly afterwards at 6:44. Following the explosion, the battleship sank in 15 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Lerman surmises {{that the}} Jewish sages {{at the time}} could argue for a {{determination}} {{of the position of}} their years in both cycles and could therefore compute the absolute year-count modulo 532 years. They were left with a number of options, 532 years apart from each other, and Lerman suggests that they chose the dating closest to what seemed to be the truth according to a literal interpretation of biblical accounts. The sages legally defined future equinox times by instituting the 28-year cycle, to protect the Hebrew dating against future change, and to leave a remembrance to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

25|$|So far, {{there have}} been many interpretations for the Buddhist crisis and the immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. Relating the events in a larger context of Vietnamese Buddhism in twentieth century and looking at the {{interactions}} between Diệm and Buddhist groups, Miller argues that the Buddhist protests during Diệm's regime were not only the struggles for discrimination in religious practices and religious freedom but also the resistances of Vietnamese Buddhism to Diệm's nation building policies centered by Personalist revolution that Buddhists considered a threat to the revival of Vietnamese Buddhist power. Until the end of his life, Diệm, along with his brother Nhu still believed that their nation building was successful and they could resolve the Buddhist crisis in their own way, like <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with the Hinh crisis in 1954 and the struggle with the Bình Xuyên in 1955.|$|E

Disraeli wrote to Lord Salisbury on 3 September, [...] "Had it not been for these unhappy 'atrocities', we should have settled a peace very honourable to England and satisfactory to Europe. [...] Now we are obliged to work from a new point of departure, and dictate to Turkey, who has forfeited all sympathy."

500|$|One Day in History was a single-day {{initiative}} {{by several}} UK heritage organisations that aimed {{to provide a}} historical record of the everyday life of the British public in the early 21st century.

The project formed a part of , a history campaign led by several UK heritage organisations.

After being available to view on the History Matters website, the archive of the diary entries was moved to the UK Web Archive at the British Library and the library of the University of Sussex.

[...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E

Valverde was holding his own off the front, and the gap was fluctuating between 1' 20" [...] and 1' 30" [...] for several kilometres as they neared the summit, which came at the flamme rouge point. 's Jurgen Van den Broeck tried to attack, but was pulled back by the Froome and Wiggins tandem, which then accelerated away from their rivals and set off after Valverde. Ultimately, they came up short due to Froome having to wait three times for Wiggins as the race leader was several metres behind his domestique on certain parts of the climb. Valverde achieved his fourth career stage victory at the Tour, nineteen seconds ahead of Froome and Wiggins, who in turn extended their advantage over the rest of the field.|$|E

[...] The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death. [...] They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: [...] "Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all".
