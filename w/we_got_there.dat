"When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> by {{the aid of}} God in the Year of Our Salvation 1615, {{not only}} were we kindly {{received}} by His Holiness the great Pope, with the Holy College of the Cardinals and a gathering of bishops and nobles, and even the joy and general happiness of the Roman People, but we and three others (whom the Japanese Christians had specially designated to announce their condition {{with respect to the}} Christian religion) were heard, rested, and just as we were hoping, dispatched as quickly as possible."

500|$|... 'You know what, I'm {{going to}} be freezing. I'm {{going to be}} miserable, I'll be {{complaining}} all day, I'll be sorry that I ever chose a cold place. So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
500|$|Bill Clinton {{has given}} dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to {{corporations}} and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech. Hillary Clinton {{said that she}} and Bill {{came out of the}} White House financially [...] "broke" [...] and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. [...] "We had no money when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education." [...] She added, [...] "Bill has worked really hard... we had to pay off all our debts... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> home <b>there</b> was no aftercare," [...] she said. [...] "It's a {{good job}} <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> good friends and family." ...|$|R

500|$|Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, {{the group}} enjoyed {{considerable}} {{success in the}} United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. [...] "The whole thing exploded for us when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> it was quite incredible. Within {{a very short time}} we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows," [...] he says. They played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.|$|E
500|$|Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear {{began to}} pitch The Rocketeer in 1986 {{to the major}} film studios but were turned down. [...] "This was 1986, long before Batman or Dick Tracy or {{anything}} similar", Stevens explained. [...] "In those days, no studio was interested at all in an expensive comic book movie. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> about three years too early for our own good!" [...] Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit {{them to make a}} trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, [...] "immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All they really wanted {{at the end of the}} day, was the name".|$|E
500|$|Craig {{spoke about}} the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that [...] "the great {{challenge}} is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, {{the entrance of the}} Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{required}} {{a great deal}} of tugging and lifting to get those three men on the bench, but <b>we</b> <b>got</b> them <b>there</b> side by side, their heads hanging listlessly, some one way, some another. I then tied each one of them firmly to the bench.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{not tell}} the truth at once, Olaf? You are afraid of this beast, and that's why you let us come on here when {{you knew it was}} in the wood. You hoped that before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>there</b> it would be too dark to hunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My fault, of course; my fault. What the deuce could I be {{thinking}} of! He, a villager's son; and we, Swancourts, connections of the Luxellians. We {{have been coming}} to nothing for centuries, and now I believe <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> What shall I next invite here, I wonder!' ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{never would}} have gone north of the Arkansas again, but my father there [...] sent for me time after time, saying it was the place for my people, and finally I went. No sooner had <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> than there was trouble. I do not want war, and my people do not, but {{although}} we have come back south of the Arkansas, the soldiers follow us and continue fighting, and {{we want you to}} send out and stop these soldiers from coming against us.|$|E
2500|$|The Dust Brothers had a {{bunch of}} music {{together}}, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they'd planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – [...] "Shake Your Rump," [...] for example. They'd put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when we said we wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, but we wanted all of that stuff on there. I think half of the tracks were written when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> and the other half we wrote together." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, {{the band}} moved to Marfa, Texas to begin {{recording}} their fourth studio album, with bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor {{returning to his}} role as producer. Droste noted, [...] "We had passed through before {{and there is a}} great arts collective and vibe. We decided to rent a place and make our next album there." [...] The band recorded [...] "an album's worth of material" [...] in Marfa, but ultimately abandoned the majority of tracks. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "We were like, 'We're ready to do this!' Then, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> and recorded twelve songs and were like, 'This isn't quite there.'" [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "We didn't have that unspoken momentum, that unspoken understanding of what everyone is into." [...] Only two songs from these sessions made it onto the finished album; [...] "Sleeping Ute" [...] and [...] "Yet Again".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we couldn't {{very well}} have taken him to Boston with us. And <b>we</b> couldn't have <b>got</b> <b>there</b> without selling him. You know you haven't married a millionnaire, Marcia." ...|$|R
50|$|We {{played to}} a couple bartenders down there, but {{even though it was}} a bad scene, it was a good experience. Basically, we weren't that good of a band, and we didn't realize it until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> down <b>there.</b> I guess we lost our focus, got really bummed out and came back to Seattle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one of them, sir. I hoped Corporal Holland {{would have}} made a bowler, but he seems to have gone off rather than come on. No; we must trust to the bowlers <b>we</b> have <b>got.</b> <b>There</b> are four or five of them who are not bad, though except yourself, sir, there is nothing, so to speak, to depend on." ...|$|R
2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny that we went back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And as soon as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's {{a little bit of}} fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.|$|E
2500|$|... "Whitney Joins The JAMs" [...] {{was given}} a low-key release in the UK, {{initially}} as a run of 500 one-sided 12-inch singles in generic monochrome KLF Communications sleeves. The vinyl labels contained only the title and [...] "120 bpm". Two repressings followed in 1987, both having a test tone groove B-side, with copies supplied in either a generic KLF Communications sleeve or a plain black sleeve. The single did not enter the UK Singles Chart, but it reached # 3 in the UK independent chart, prompting the UK television programme [...] "The Chart Show" [...] to request a music video. [...] The JAMs obliged, hiring a video camera and getting a friend to film them driving to [...] "The Chart Show" [...] studio in Cauty's repainted Ford Galaxie American police car. [...] According to Drummond, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> we took out the cassette, handed it in at the gate and said 'that's your video'! The next day it was on national TV. It cost us £19.96". [...] Flippantly, he concluded [...] "Most record companies spend up to 100 grand on their vids and almost as much on lunches {{trying to get people}} to screen them." [...] The video was remembered in 1991 by NME, who thought that [...] The KLF's VHS compilation The Stadium House Trilogy would have benefitted from the inclusion of the [...] "pre-megastardom" [...] video. The song features on neither of The JAMs' studio albums, but is included on the duo's 1988 compilation and remix album Shag Times, where co-authorship credit is given to composers of works sampled in the track. [...] Shag Times also contains an instrumental remix of the song, credited to The KLF.|$|E

6000|$|... "There's {{where we}} started him!" [...] you will cry, [...] "and away he scudded, over there among the chestnuts, and Rover right at his heels, and when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> down <b>there</b> to the creek, Rover turned heels-over-head on the ice, he was going so fast; but I gave one slide right across, and just up there, by the big walnut, the other two dogs got him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, lass, you're a hard woman,' {{was all he}} said. And {{they were}} his last words. Thomas and I carried {{him back to his}} room, but the breath was gone from him before <b>we</b> ever <b>got</b> him <b>there.</b>|$|R

60|$|It was {{the last}} of March when we came to the bay, and having stayed there {{fourteen}} days, to furnish ourselves with all things <b>we</b> wanted, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> intelligence <b>there,</b> that there were three ships at Buenos Ayres, in the river Rio de la Plata, which were preparing to go for Europe, and that they expected two Spanish men of war to be their convoy, because of the Portuguese men of war which were in Brazil, to convoy the Brazil fleet.|$|R

5000|$|Roiland and Harmon were {{convinced}} the episode was a mess. [...] "It {{went off the}} deep end conceptually and got really over-complicated," [...] said Harmon.

6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} would do to make a bolt through that, sir," [...] the {{sergeant}} said, shaking his head.
