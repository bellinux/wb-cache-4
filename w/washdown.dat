These include spreading weeds and pathogens, starting fires and crushing birds nests on beaches, amongst others. In Australia, as elsewhere, off-road vehicles and horse are allowed only in some places in some parks, and often only under permit. We have very little reliable scientific information to-date on just how serious these impacts may be, and on how well they might be managed through minimal-impact practise such as vehicle <b>washdowns,</b> stockfeed processing and seasonal closures.

40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 34 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 34 consists of four Corrective Action Sites (CASs). The CAU is located within the Area 3 Compound at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) {{in the vicinity of}} the Mud Plant Facility in Yucca Valley. Historically, CAS 03 - 09 - 07, Mud Pit, was used for disposal of excess mud from washing drilling equipment from 1968 to 1974, at which time it began to be used for excess mud disposal (currently inactive); CAS 03 - 44 - 01, Chromium Contamination Spill, was used to store additives used in the formulation of drilling mud from the early 1960 s to the mid- 1990 s; CAS 03 - 47 - 02, Area 3 Mud Plant Pond, was used as a freshwater storage reservoir for the mud plant as well as supplied water for a number of activities including the mixing of mud, the rinsing and cleaning of tanks, and various <b>washdowns</b> from the 1960 s through 1990 s; and CAS 03 - 09 - 06, Mud Disposal Crater, was created in 1962 by an underground nuclear detonation (i. e., Chinchilla test) and was used to mix and store mud, dispose of receiving waste from the mud plant floor drains and excess drilling mud, and clean/flush mix tanks through the mid- 1990 s. Based on site history, the scope of this plan is to identify potentially contaminated ground soil at each of the four CASs and determine the quantity, nature, and extent of contaminants of potential concern (COPCs). The investigation will include systematic and biased surface and subsurface soil and mud sampling using hand-auguring and direct-push techniques; visual, video, and/or electromagnetic surveys of pipes; field screening for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and alpha/beta-emitting radionuclides; and laboratory analysis to characterize any investigation-derived waste for disposal both on site at NTS and at off-site locations. Historical information provided by former NTS employees indicates that COPCs include VOCs, semivolatile organic compounds, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, gamma-emitting radionuclides, isotopic plutonium, and strontium- 90. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R

50|$|In case {{of water}} surface bursts, the {{particles}} {{tend to be}} rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly sea salts with some water; these can have a cloud seeding effect causing local rainout and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a seawater burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into porous surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic ions that chemically bond to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this chemically bonded activity from concrete or steel. Complete decontamination requires aggressive treatment like sandblasting, or acidic treatment. After the Crossroads underwater test, {{it was found that}} wet fallout must be immediately removed from ships by continuous water <b>washdown</b> (such as from the fire sprinkler system on the decks).|$|E
5000|$|Within the {{agricultural}} sector, withdrawn water use is for irrigation and for livestock.

[...] Because agriculture is a major user of withdrawn water, changes in the magnitude and efficiency of its water use are important. In the US, from 1980 (when agriculture’s withdrawn water use peaked) to 2010, there was a 23 percent reduction in agriculture’s use of withdrawn water, while US agricultural output increased by 49 percent over that period.|$|E
50|$|<b>Washdown</b> is {{the process}} of using a stream of water to clean a flat or nearly flat outside surface. Typically the area cleaned is a large expanse of {{concrete}} or asphalt. The area is cleaned of dirt and debris by the use of the force and dissolving power of stream of water as projected from a hose. Generally, one person holds and aims the hose, though if the hose is longer than 300 feet then another person may be required to help move the hose itself. Water is typically squirted from the hose at a pressure of 300 psi. The hose itself can vary in length from 75 to 425 feet. Though typically the hose when used by a single person is 300 feet long. The hose itself carries water from a water main which attaches to the hose through what is called a “stinger“. The stinger screws into the water main pipe and is held there.|$|E

5000|$|Considerable {{water use}} is {{associated}} with meat production, mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed. There are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production, but {{the amount of water}} use assignable to such production is seldom estimated. For example, “green water” use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and “green water” has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production’s “water footprint”, and on rangeland, as much as 99.5% of the water use associated with beef production is “green water”. However, it would be misleading simply to assign that associated rangeland green water use to beef production, partly because that evapotranspirational use occurs {{even in the absence of}} cattle. Even when cattle are present, most of that associated water use can be considered assignable to production of terrestrial environmental values, because it produces root and residue biomass important for erosion control, stabilization of soil structure, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, support of numerous primary consumers, many of which support higher trophic levels, etc. Withdrawn water (from surface and groundwater sources) is used for livestock watering, and in some cases is also used for irrigation of forage and feed crops. Whereas all irrigation in the US (including loss in conveyance) is estimated to account for about 38% of US withdrawn freshwater use, irrigation water for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9%; other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector (for drinking, <b>washdown</b> of facilities, etc.) is estimated at about 0.7%. [...] Because of the preponderance of non-meat products from the livestock sector only some fraction of this water use is assignable to meat production.|$|E

This corrective action investigation was conducted {{in accordance with the}} Corrective Action Investigation Plan for CAU 240 as developed under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Located in Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site in Nevada, CAU 240 is comprised of three Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : 25 - 07 - 01, Vehicle <b>Washdown</b> Area (Propellant Pad); 25 - 07 - 02, Vehicle <b>Washdown</b> Area (F and J Roads Pad); and 25 - 07 - 03, Vehicle <b>Washdown</b> Station (RADSAFE Pad). In March 1999, the corrective action investigation was performed to detect and evaluate analyte concentrations against preliminary action levels (PALs) to determine contaminants of concern (COCs). There were no COCs identified at CAS 25 - 07 - 01 or CAS 25 - 07 - 03; therefore, {{there was no need for}} corrective action at these two CASs. At CAS 25 - 07 - 02, diesel-range organics and radionuclide concentrations in soil samples from F and J Roads Pad exceeded PALs. Based on this result, potential CAAs were identified and evaluated to ensure worker, public, and environmental protection against potential exposure to COCs in accordance with Nevada Administrative Code 445 A. Following a review of potential exposure pathways, existing data, and future and current operations in Area 25, two CAAs were identified for CAU 240 (CAS 25 - 07 - 02) : Alternative 1 - No Further Action and Alternative 2 - Clean Closure by Excavation and Disposal. Alternative 2 was identified as the preferred alternative.

Characterization activities indicated that only CAS 25 - 07 - 02 (F and J Roads Pad) contained constituents of concern (COCs) above action levels and required remediation. The COCs detected were Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel, cesium- 137, and strontium- 90. The F and J Roads Pad may have been used for the decontamination of vehicles and possibly disassembled engine and reactor parts from Test Cell C. Activities occurred there during the 1960 s through early 1970 s. The F and J Roads Pad consisted of a 9 - by 5 -meter (m) (30 - by 15 -foot [ft]) concrete pad and a 14 - by 13 -m (46 -by 43 -ft) gravel sump. The clean-closure corrective action consisted of excavation, disposal, verification sampling, backfilling, and regrading. Closure activities began on August 21, 2000, and ended on September 19, 2000.
