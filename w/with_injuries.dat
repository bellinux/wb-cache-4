5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> higher on the spine. Women <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E

In his first season, Maryland was riddled <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record.

Breedlove later went on to play {{eight years in the}} NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance.|$|E

5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> on the left side of the brain than for those <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E

5|$|At Stanford, Hammonds {{was named}} an All-American. The Orioles {{selected}} Hammonds with the fourth overall {{selection of the}} 1992 MLB Draft. Though he was seen {{as one of the}} best prospects in baseball, injuries limited his performance with Baltimore. After he was traded to Cincinnati and then to Colorado, he emerged with the Rockies in 2000, and was selected to appear at the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He signed a three-year, $21.75 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers that off-season, but continued to struggle <b>with</b> <b>injuries.</b> He had a resurgence with the Giants in 2003, after he was released by the Brewers, but struggled with the Giants in 2004 and Nationals in 2005 before retiring.|$|E
5|$|Hacker {{was drafted}} out of Duncanville High School by the New York Yankees in 2002.

5|$|Hobbs missed more cricket <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> and {{illnesses}} in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, {{he missed}} {{more than a}} third of Surrey's matches. However, he scored heavily and compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.|$|E

5|$|In early September 1994, Tolliver {{was signed}} to a {{contract}} by the Houston Oilers. He was originally the third-string quarterback, but ineffectiveness by Bucky Richardson led Tolliver to relieve him {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. Tolliver played well enough to be considered for the starting job the following week due to Cody Carlson dealing <b>with</b> <b>injuries.</b> Tolliver made his first start in a game against the Raiders, but played inconsistently over seven starts and was replaced by Richardson in the season finale against the New York Jets. After finishing the season, Tolliver became a free agent and left the NFL.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} week, Florida crushed the {{mismatched}} Sewanee Tigers 71–6 in Jacksonville despite Sewanee's highly publicized aerial attack. Clyde Crabtree and Tommy Owens {{had to sit}} out <b>with</b> <b>injuries.</b> Goof Bowyer, Red Bethea, and Broward McClellan were seen as {{the stars of the}} game. The Gators played substitutes throughout the second half, putting the first stringers back in {{by the middle of the}} fourth quarter. Florida's center, Frank Clark, also drew praise for his play on the line. This score placed the Gators in first place for scoring within the Southern Conference, and still remains one of the seven highest single-game scoring totals in Gators team history.|$|E
5|$|In the offseason, Houston saw {{major changes}} in the roster as the Rockets {{acquired}} Tracy McGrady in a seven-player deal with the Orlando Magic. The scoring champion McGrady and the strong rebounder Yao formed a well-regarded pair that helped the Rockets win 22 consecutive games in the 2007–08 NBA season, which was at the time the 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history. Still, the duo was plagued <b>with</b> <b>injuries</b> – of the 463 regular season games for which they were teammates, Yao missed 146 and McGrady 160 – and did not win any playoff series, despite gathering leads over the Dallas Mavericks in 2005 and the Jazz in 2007. After the 2007 elimination, Van Gundy was fired, and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him.|$|E
