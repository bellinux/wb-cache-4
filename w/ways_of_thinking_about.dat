5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the church and its personnel, derived not only from {{contemporary}} continental movements {{but also from the}} rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E

25|$|In 1498, Annius of Viterbo (an {{official}} of Pope Alexander VI) {{claimed to have}} discovered lost books of Berossus. These were in fact an elaborate forgery. However, they greatly influenced Renaissance <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> population and migration, because Annius provided a list of kings from Japhet onwards, filling a historical gap following the Biblical account of the Flood. Annius also introduced characters from classical sources into the biblical framework, publishing his account as Commentaria super opera diversorum auctorum de antiquitatibus loquentium (Commentaries on the Works of Various Authors Discussing Antiquity). One consequence was sophisticated theories about Celtic races with Druid priests in Western Europe.|$|E

25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{thinking}}</b> <b>about</b> technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E

McManus states that grunge dealt with serious, [...] "weighty" [...] topics, which does not occur often in popular music.

500|$|While some {{descriptions}} of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms {{did not occur}} until the 18th century. Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. There {{are a number of}} stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called [...] "artificial systems", including Linnaeus's system of sexual classification. Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as [...] "natural systems", such as those of de Jussieu (1789), de Candolle (1813) and Bentham and Hooker (1862–1863). These were pre-evolutionary in thinking. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) led to new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> classification based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of phyletic systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of Eichler (1883) and Engler (1886–1892). The advent of molecular genetics and statistical methodology allowed the creation of the modern era of [...] "phylogenetic systems" [...] based on cladistics, rather than morphology alone.|$|E
500|$|To most philosophers, {{the word}} [...] "consciousness" [...] connotes the {{relationship}} between the mind and the world. To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes {{the relationship between}} the mind and God, or {{the relationship between the}} mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world. [...] Krishna consciousness, for example, is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna. [...] The mystical psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke distinguished between three types of consciousness: [...] Simple Consciousness, awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; Self Consciousness, awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and Cosmic Consciousness, awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who are enlightened. [...] Many more examples could be given, such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by Prem Saran Satsangi and Stuart Hameroff. The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be Ken Wilber's book The Spectrum of Consciousness, a comparison of western and eastern <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the mind. Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.|$|E

2500|$|The global workforce, or {{international}} labor pool, reflects {{a new international}} division of labor that has been emerging since the late 1970s {{in the wake of}} other forces of globalization. [...] The global economic factors driving the rise of multinational corporations—namely, cross-border movement of goods, services, technology and capital—are changing <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> labor and the structure of today's workforce. [...] With roots in the social processes surrounding the shift to standardization and industrialization, post-industrial society in the Western world has been accompanied by industrialization {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in Asia. As industrialization takes hold worldwide and more cultures move away from traditional practices in respect to work and labor, the ways in which employers think about and utilize labor are changing. Usually barriers come into play such as different laws.|$|E
2500|$|Self-help is {{also part}} of {{humanistic}} psychology: Sheila Ernst and Lucy Goodison have described using some of the main humanistic approaches in self-help groups. [...] Humanistic Psychology is applicable to self-help because it is oriented towards changing the way a person thinks. [...] One can only improve once they decide to change their <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> themselves, once they decide to help themselves. [...] Co-counselling, which is an approach based purely on self-help, is regarded as coming from humanistic psychology as well. Humanistic theory has had a strong influence on other forms of popular therapy, including Harvey Jackins' Re-evaluation Counselling and the work of Carl Rogers, including his student Eugene Gendlin; (see Focusing) {{as well as on the}} development of the Humanistic Psychodrama by Hans-Werner Gessmann since the 80s.|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein rejects {{a variety}} of <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what {{the meaning of a}} word is, or how {{meanings}} can be identified. He shows how, in each case, {{the meaning of the word}} presupposes our ability to use it. He first asks the reader to perform a thought experiment: to come up with a definition of the word [...] "game". [...] While this may at first seem a simple task, he then goes on to lead us through the problems with each of the possible definitions of the word [...] "game". Any definition that focuses on amusement leaves us unsatisfied since the feelings experienced by a world class chess player are very different from those of a circle of children playing Duck Duck Goose. Any definition that focuses on competition will fail to explain the game of catch, or the game of solitaire. And a definition of the word [...] "game" [...] that focuses on rules will fall on similar difficulties.|$|E

2500|$|To better {{understand}} what aphasia {{is and how}} it affects both mental and physical aspects of speech, {{it is important to}} understand the history first. By knowing more about the history of this disorder, the better chance there is of ruling out potential misnomers of the disorder and possibly discovering new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> treatment options. Although the cause for different types of aphasia's are mostly known, the best way to recover is still unknown. Many ancient cultures, [...] such as the Egyptians, believed that the heart was where a person's soul was housed, therefore any issues of expression were caused by injury or tainting of the soul. The first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian papyrus, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, which details speech problems in a person with a traumatic brain injury to the temporal lobe. During the second half of the 19th century, aphasia was a major focus for scientists and philosophers who were working in the beginning stages of the field of psychology.|$|E
2500|$|When {{psychiatrists and}} pediatricians {{first began to}} {{recognize}} and discuss childhood psychiatric disorders in the 19th century, they were largely influenced by literary works of the Victorian era. Authors like the Brontë sisters, [...] George Eliot, and Charles Dickens, introduced new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the child mind and the potential influence early childhood experiences could have on child development and the subsequent adult mind. When the Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology, the first psychiatric journal in English, was published in 1848, child psychiatry didn’t exist as its own field yet. However, {{some of the earliest}} works on the possibility of nervous disorders and [...] "insanity" [...] in children were published in the Journal and several medical writers directly referenced works such as Jane Eyre (1847), Wuthering Heights (1847), Dombey and Son (1848), and David Copperfield (1850), to illustrate this new conceptualization of the child mind. Until that time, it was generally accepted that children were free from nervous disorders and the [...] "passions" [...] that affected the adult mind.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} structural {{device is}} {{the series of}} nine meetings (gams) between the Pequod and other ships. These meetings are important in three ways. First, their placement in the narrative. The initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other. The central group of five gams are separated by about 12 chapters, more or less. This pattern provides a structural element, remarks Bezanson, as if the encounters were [...] "bones to the book's flesh". Second, Ahab's developing responses to the meetings plot the [...] "rising curve of his passion" [...] and of his monomania. Third, in contrast to Ahab, Ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually: [...] "each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads." [...] Bezanson sees no single way {{to account for the}} meaning of all of these ships. Instead, they may be interpreted as [...] "a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth,'as well as concrete and symbolic <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the White Whale".|$|E

2500|$|Perceptions {{of races}} [...] have {{drastically}} {{changed over the}} years dating {{all the way back to}} the medieval era referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the Atlantic slave trade which left ideas of idealism for Caucasians and a negative idea of any other race. Caucasian nationalists also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race, [...] "Goldsmith maintained that all humans sprung from one common parent and attributed the variations in the human family to the influence of climate, culture, and custom". With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference. [...] "The ideas about beauty we contend with in the twenty- first century draw in part on very old <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> human bodies and African difference." [...] In the 1960s the Black is Beautiful movement and Black Power movement took form and shook the world in a display of racial pride. Today's perceptions of different races has come a long way in bringing a positive mentality to racial body image but there are still some core issues in today's society.|$|E
2500|$|Tschumi has {{continued}} this design agenda {{in a variety}} of design competitions and built projects since 1983. The 1986 Tokyo National Theater and Opera House project continued the research that Tschumi began in The Manhattan Transcripts, importing notational techniques from experimental dance and musical scores, and using the design process itself to challenge habitual <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> space, in contrast to earlier static, two dimensional representational techniques which delineated the outline of a building but not the intensity of life within it. [...] At a local scale in his 1990 Video Pavilion at Groningen, transparent walls and tilted floors produce an intense dislocation of the subject in relation to norms like wall, interior and exterior, and horizon. [...] At the urban scale in such projects as the 1992 Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains, in Tourcoing, France, and the 1995 architecture school at Marne la Vallee, France (both completed 1999), larger spaces challenge normative program sequence and accepted use. The Le Fresnoy complex accomplishes this by its use of the space between the roofs of existing buildings and an added, huge umbrella roof above them which creates an interstitial zone of program on ramps and catwalks. [...] This zone is what Tschumi calls the in-between, a negation of pure form or style that had been practiced in the 1989 ZKM Karlsruhe competition project, where a large atrium space punctuated by encapsulated circulation and smaller program episodes developed a more local network of interstitial space.|$|E
