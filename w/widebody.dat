5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class will feature a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (<b>widebody</b> aircraft) of pitch, while the new Economy Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (<b>widebody</b> aircraft) of pitch. The retrofitting process is expected to be complete by the end of 2014.|$|E
5|$|JAL is {{also known}} for its liveries {{featuring}} Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, {{as it is the}} official airline of the Tokyo Disney Resort. They sponsor the attraction Star Jets (not related to past Star Jets fleet with the old tsurumaru livery), which feature a variation of the current livery on the ride vehicles. At one time there were more than six <b>widebody</b> aircraft painted with the special liveries.|$|E
5|$|Air Greenland also {{performs}} charter flights within Europe {{on behalf}} of European travel agencies using its Airbus A330. In 2015, the decision voted by Greenland's governments to extend the runways of Nuuk and Ilulissat airports directly threatened the purpose of Air Greenland's single <b>widebody</b> aircraft. The A330 was only used from Pituffik and Kangerlussuaq to Copenhagen Kastrup, but in January 2017, Air Greenland had announced more commercial routes to {{be covered by the}} aircraft between Iceland and Greenland. In March 2017, Air Greenland also announced adding more flights to Kangerlussuaq.|$|E

50|$|Also in 1984, BCal {{received}} two brand-new A310-200 <b>widebodies</b> at BCal's Gatwick base.|$|R
5|$|The A320 {{retained}} the dark cockpit where an indicator is off when its system is running {{to draw attention}} on dysfunctions from the A310, the first <b>widebody</b> designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler's son. All following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training; for Roger Béteille, former Airbus president, this choice {{was one of the}} most difficult he had ever made.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic <b>widebody</b> service on this route.|$|E
25|$|There were twelve Fortissimo racquets {{produced}} {{and only two}} are reportedly still extant, {{both of which are}} possessed by Siegfried Kuebler, the designer notable for creating <b>widebody</b> racquets. Those led to the very popular and extremely influential Wilson Profile racquet of 1987. Kuebler's first <b>widebody</b> racquet emerged in 1984.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Monarch Airlines leased two McDonnell Douglas MD-11 widebodied {{aircraft}} from World Airways for its long-haul operations whilst {{awaiting the}} delivery {{of a pair of}} new Airbus A330-200 <b>widebodies.</b> Following the A330s arrival in 1999, Monarch returned the MD-11s to World Airways. The new A330 <b>widebodies</b> permitted Monarch to serve long-haul charter destinations with a two class seating configuration, another first for the airline.|$|R
5000|$|A Laker Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-10 series 10 {{was one of}} four <b>widebodies</b> {{that were}} {{specially}} flown in for the pre-inauguration of the then new terminal building at Berlin's Tegel Airport on 23 October 1974. (A British Airways Lockheed L-1011 Tristar 1, a Pan Am Boeing 747-100 and an Air France Airbus A300 B2 were the other <b>widebodies</b> specially flown in on that day to mark this occasion.) ...|$|R

25|$|The Air Canada {{mainline}} fleet {{consists of}} the following registered aircraft (as of November 2017). All mainline aircraft are fitted with individual video displays in all classes. WiFi is installed on all narrowbody aircraft and will be fitted on <b>widebody</b> aircraft starting Fall 2016. The majority of the <b>widebody</b> aircraft (Boeing 767, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Airbus A330) operate from Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E
25|$|Air Canada's International Business Class cabins are {{available}} on all <b>widebody</b> aircraft. There are two different cabins available: the Executive Pod and the Classic Pod. All services feature AVOD (Audio Video On Demand) on a touch screen, noise cancelling headphones, and music provided by XM Satellite Radio. This cabin is sold as Business Class — Transcontinental when <b>widebody</b> aircraft operate on routes within North America, and is sold at a premium compared to the North American Business Class product on narrowbody aircraft.|$|E
25|$|BUA {{estimated}} {{that it needed}} to invest £60 million in new aircraft, including the then latest generation <b>widebody</b> and supersonic aircraft, and £25 million for the associated ground facilities and working capital.|$|E
50|$|The VIP <b>widebodies</b> {{are based}} on the A330/A340/A350/A380 aircraft. Additional fuel tanks are {{expanding}} the range with most increase for the A330 Prestige.|$|R
50|$|In early 1979, {{the airline}} ordered a further two McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 series 10 <b>widebodies</b> {{as well as}} five longer range McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 series 30 widebodied aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Following Laker's demise {{at the end}} of {{the first}} week of February in 1982, a number of {{aircraft}} the airline had operated at that time were quickly re-allocated to other operators. These included two McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 <b>widebodies</b> that joined the fleet of British Caledonian Charter, BCal's charter division, four BAC One-Eleven 300 narrowbodies that replaced the seven One-Eleven 200s BCal had inherited from British United Airways at the time of its formation and two Airbus A300B4 <b>widebodies</b> that were placed with Air Jamaica.|$|R
25|$|The CF6-80C2 is {{currently}} certified on eleven <b>widebody</b> aircraft models including the Boeing 747-400, and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The CF6-80C2 is also certified for ETOPS-180 for the Airbus A300, Airbus A310, Boeing 767, and, Kawasaki C-2(CF6-80C2K), as the F138-GE-100, the U.S. Air Force's C-5M Super Galaxy.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Jersey Jack Pinball {{released}} The Wizard of Oz pinball machine. It is {{the first}} pinball machine manufactured in the USA with an LCD as backbox, the first <b>widebody</b> pinball machine since 1994 and the first new US pinball machine not made by Stern Pinball since 2001.|$|E
25|$|ANA was {{the launch}} {{customer}} {{for the new}} Boeing <b>widebody,</b> the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, ordering 50 examples with an option for 50 more during April 2004. ANA split the order between 30 of the short-range 787-3 and 20 of the long haul 787-8. However, ANA later converted its -3 orders to the -8 variant.|$|E
50|$|BCal was {{evaluating}} {{both the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-80 narrowbody {{as well as}} the Airbus A310 and Boeing 767 <b>widebodies</b> as suitable long-term replacements for its existing narrowbodied aircraft on these routes.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, the {{deliveries}} {{went for}} 38% in Asia-Pacific, 25% in Europe, 22% in North America, 7% in Middle East, 6% in South America and 2% in Africa. 1,020 narrowbodies were delivered and their backlog reach : 4,991 A320neo, [...] A320ceo; 3,593 737 Max, 835 737NG, 348 CSeries, 305 C919 and 175 MC-21; while 398 <b>widebodies</b> were delivered : 137 Dreamliners and 99 B777 for Boeing (65%) against 63 A330 and 49 A350 for Airbus, more than 2,400 <b>widebodies</b> were in backlog, {{led by the}} A350 with 753 (31%) then the Boeing 787 with 694 (28%).|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, British Airtours {{also began}} taking {{delivery}} of {{a small number of}} former British Airways Lockheed L-1011 Tristar <b>widebodies,</b> which initially supplemented its narrowbodied 737 fleet on the busier and more popular routes.|$|R
25|$|Air France {{operates}} a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing <b>widebody</b> jets on long-haul routes, and uses Airbus A320 family aircraft on short-haul routes. Air France introduced the A380 on 20 November 2009 with service to New York City's JFK Airport from Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport. The carrier's regional airline subsidiary, HOP!, operates {{the majority of}} its regional domestic and European scheduled services with a fleet of regional jet aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{sought to}} compete with the {{well-established}} Boeing in the 1970s through its introduction of advanced technology. For example, the A300 made the most extensive use of composite materials yet seen in an aircraft of that era, and by automating the flight engineer's functions, was the first <b>widebody</b> jet to have a two-man flight crew. In the 1980s Airbus was the first to introduce digital fly-by-wire controls into an airliner (the A320).|$|E
25|$|The {{airport is}} {{operational}} 24 hours a day. It {{is able to}} handle large aircraft {{up to and including}} the Boeing 747-400 and Antonov An-225. The majority of freight services use <b>widebody</b> aircraft, with Cargolux mainly now using their new Boeing 747-8F aircraft and Air France operating the Boeing 777F. Volga-Dnepr are also occasional users of Prestwick with Antonov An-124 aircraft. The apron features seven nose-in PAPA/AGNIS (1A,1,2,3,4,7,8) plus 5 stands assisted by Ground Operations (5,6,9,10,11).|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Monarch Airlines {{operated}} several Boeing 767-300ER <b>widebodies</b> {{on behalf of}} Alitalia Team, a unit of Italy's flag carrier, under a wet lease arrangement {{similar to the one}} Monarch had with Euroberlin France.|$|R
50|$|Cyprus made a {{transition}} to Airbus aircraft {{over the course of}} the decade. Its first A310 <b>widebodies</b> arrived in 1984, followed by A320s in 1989. The order for the eight A320s was worth more than DEM 250 million.|$|R
50|$|The airline {{also became}} one of the early buyers of the first Airbus airliner, the A300, {{ordering}} ten of these <b>widebodies</b> in 1979 and had plans to deploy the aircraft on a new network of intra-European Skytrain routes in a big way.|$|R
25|$|The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-haul, <b>widebody,</b> {{twin-engine}} jetliner, {{which features}} light-weight construction. The aircraft is 80 percent composite by volume; Boeing lists its materials by weight as 50 percent composite, 20 percent aluminum, 15 percent titanium, 10 percent steel, and 5 percent other. Aluminum {{has been used}} throughout the wing and tail leading edges, titanium is predominantly present within {{the elements of the}} engines and fasteners, while various individual components are composed of steel.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the TriStar led {{to an increase in}} maintenance personnel and the modification of an existing hangar at the airline's Luton base to accommodate the new <b>widebody.</b> It also resulted in the purchase of a former Royal Air Force Blackburn Beverley cargo transporter from the Royal Aircraft Establishment to airlift Rolls-Royce RB211 replacement engines and/or other essential spares in case the planes developed a serious technical fault at an overseas station that prevented them from returning to Luton.|$|E
25|$|The new {{terminal}} buildings at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened in April 1967, and in 1968 the stretched Douglas DC-8-63 entered service. With 244 seats, {{it was the}} largest airliner at the time. KLM was the first airline to put the higher-gross-weight Boeing 747-200B, powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines, into service in February 1971; this began the airline's use of <b>widebody</b> jets. In March 1971, KLM opened its current headquarters in Amstelveen. In 1972, it purchased the first of several Douglas DC-10 aircraft—McDonnell Douglas's response to Boeing's 747.|$|E
25|$|Laker Airways's {{decision}} to replace its Tegel-based BAC One-Eleven fleet {{with one of}} its newly acquired Airbus A300 B4 <b>widebodies</b> from the 1981 summer season resulted in Monarch Airlines taking over that airline's long-standing charter contract with Flug-Union Berlin, one of West Berlin's leading contemporary tour operators.|$|R
5000|$|On July 7, 2017, Air Canada Flight 759, an Airbus A320-211 (Registration C-FKCK) nearly {{landed on}} a taxiway with four loaded {{passenger}} <b>widebodies</b> queued for takeoff at SFO, with a retired pilot commenting the near miss [...] "probably came close to the greatest aviation disaster in history".|$|R
50|$|As Skytrain {{expanded}} to other British and U.S. gateways, the airline placed orders for additional McDonnell Douglas DC-10 <b>widebodies,</b> including the company's first order for five longer-range series-30 aircraft required for its Los Angeles flights. These were delivered from December 1979 onwards {{to support its}} growing number of destinations and frequencies.|$|R
