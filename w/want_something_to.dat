500|$|In [...] "" [...] (1993), Tessa {{witnesses}} {{the brutal}} murder of former artist Anne Wheeler (Diana Barrington), and reacts angrily when {{she realizes that}} the police will do nothing about it, saying: [...] "I'm not hysterical, I don't see things, and I'm not looking for attention. I just <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be done." [...] She decides to find the murderer on her own. When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that if something happened to him she would be fine, Tessa retorts, [...] "You only think so because it suits you." [...] The murderer is Chief Police Officer Andrew Ballin (Tom Butler) who is beheaded by MacLeod after Ballin failed to kill Tessa.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{praised the}} {{commercial}} {{nature of the}} album and called it [...] "a mature pop album only in that it's aimed at the boozy girl's night out rather than the school disco". Jacqueline Hodges favoured the album's consistency and complimented its commercial prospect, predicting that the album is [...] "going to sell bucket loads". Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly labelled the album [...] "the best guilty-pleasure retro-dance smash since Eiffel 65's [...] "Blue"", but felt that Minogue [...] "milks the formula (of [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head") dry on the album". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH enjoyed the fun nature of the album and said that [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> drive to, dance to, play at a house party or cheer your workmates up with, Fever is for you". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a negative review, criticizing Minogue's [...] "painfully precise" [...] vocals and the album's monotony.|$|E
500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what I say is right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the Reports first Wørd segment, using the term [...] "truthiness" [...] as he explained what he perceives to {{be the difference between}} [...] "those who think with their head and those who know with their heart". He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority of people <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E

2500|$|The book's main {{theme is}} about finding one's destiny. According to The New York Times, The Alchemist is [...] "more {{self-help}} than literature." [...] An old king tells Santiago that, [...] "when you really <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> happen, {{the whole universe}} will conspire so that your wish comes true." [...] This {{is the core of}} the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays all throughout Coelho's writing in The Alchemist.|$|E
2500|$|Tribulation Periwinkle {{opens the}} story by complaining, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do."

She then describes her travel through New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore en route to Washington D. C.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the hour}} {{preceding}} the attack, 13 people including the shooter {{participated in the}} Bible study. [...] According to the accounts of people who talked to survivors, when the shooter walked into the historic African-American church, he immediately asked for Pinckney and {{sat down next to}} him, initially listening to others during the study. He started to disagree when they began discussing Scripture. Eventually, after waiting for the other participants to begin praying, he stood up and pulled a gun from a fanny pack, aiming it at 87-year-old Susie Jackson. Jackson's nephew, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, tried to talk him down and asked him why he was attacking churchgoers. The shooter responded, [...] "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go." [...] When he expressed his intention to shoot everyone, Sanders dove in front of Jackson and was shot first. The suspect then shot the other victims, all the while shouting racial epithets. He also reportedly said, [...] "Y'all <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> pray about? I'll give you something to pray about." [...] He reloaded his gun five times. Sanders' mother and his five-year-old niece, both attending the study, survived the shooting by pretending to be dead.|$|E

2500|$|Godard became {{interested}} in 3D because [...] "it is still an area {{where there are no}} rules" [...] and thought it was not interesting because it had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, [...] "reveal something cultural", such as what it [...] "mean about the times it emerged from" [...] and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as CinemaScope, dolly shots, close-ups or high fidelity are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by Auguste and Louis Lumière and D. W. Griffith, who made films before there were [...] "rules" [...] about technique, stating [...] "when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules." [...] His inspiration came from the invention of perspective in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something [...] "beyond the frame." [...] Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that repeat with two different couples. Godard was following Alfred Hitchcock's theory that [...] "when you <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be understood, you say it at least twice." ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its {{main concern is}} not the black woman per se but rather the black woman {{is the point of}} origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. [...] "Purple is to Lavender" [...] illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In [...] "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp.67–70). They go on to describe the concept of [...] "The Politics of Naming" [...] which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp.73–75). Jain states: [...] "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, [...] "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals <b>want</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: [...] "I don't choose womanism because it is [...] "better" [...] than feminism...I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" [...] (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp.77–78).|$|E
