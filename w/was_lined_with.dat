5|$|The {{band of the}} Great Eastern Railway, {{augmented}} by drummers from the Royal Marines, played the Dead March. Eternal Father, Strong to Save and Abide with Me were sung, and a blessing given by the Bishop of London. The route of the coffin to Liverpool Street station <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> people. Fryatt was buried at All Saints' Church, Upper Dovercourt. His coffin was carried from the station to the church on a gun carriage. His widow was presented with the insignia of the Belgian Order of Leopold that had been posthumously awarded to Fryatt. Fryatt was also posthumously awarded the Belgian Maritime War Cross.|$|E
5|$|The site abuts a major ancient intersection. Opposite lay a {{large public}} square {{fronting}} the Temple's main Hulda Gates. The Tyropoeon street itself <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> shops and formed {{part of the}} city's Lower Market. The Royal Stoa, an exceptionally large basilica complex which served various commercial and legal functions, looked down on the intersection from atop the Temple platform. Although the Stoa stood on the Temple esplanade, it was constructed upon an expansion added by Herod. It was therefore evidently not considered sacred by some at the time, allowing it {{to be used for}} mundane activities. The heavy public traffic to and from this edifice accounts for the width of the stepped street, which approximates that of a modern four-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, Dawson's {{population}} rose further to 30,000 as stampeders arrived over the passes. The centre of the town, Front Street, <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> hastily built buildings and warehouses, together with log cabins and tents spreading out across {{the rest of the}} settlement. There was no running water or sewerage, and only two springs for drinking water to supplement the increasingly polluted river. In spring, the unpaved streets were churned into thick mud and in summer the settlement reeked of human effluent and was plagued by flies and mosquitoes. Land in Dawson was now scarce, and plots sold for up to $10,000 ($8 million) each; prime locations on Front Street could reach $20,000 ($16 million) while a small log cabin might rent for $100 ($2,700) a month. As a result, Dawson's population spread south into the empty Hän village, renaming it Klondike City. Other communities emerged closer to the mines, such as Granville on Dominion Creek and Grand Forks on Bonanza Creek.|$|E
50|$|The hoods of Professional Doctorates {{are made}} of red fabric lined in royal blue faille. All other {{doctorate}} hoods are in royal blue fabric distinguished by their linings. Doctorates of Philosophy <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> red faille, Honorary Doctorates <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> blue satin, Honorary Doctorates honoris causa <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> blue satin with an edging strip in gold, and Honorary Doctors of the University have hoods <b>lined</b> entirely <b>with</b> gold satin.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the restaurant building is an open space similar to the retail building but larger in scale. The steel portal frame is exposed {{on the inside and}} ceilings <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> bamboo. The northern side of the space has been fitted with servery counters and kitchen rooms. The floor <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> carpet. The steel columns <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> plasterboard and painted. Air conditioning vents, ceiling fans and pendant lights are suspended from the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{building}} comprises several office spaces. Walls and ceilings <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> fibrous cement sheeting joined with cover strips and floors <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> carpet. Internal doors are panelled timber. Cornices and picture rails are simply detailed and formed from timber.|$|R
5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl {{in the top of}} a rotting tree stump that <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E
25|$|Another project, Karnak's Red Chapel, or Chapelle Rouge, was {{intended}} as a barque shrine and originally may have stood between her two obelisks. It <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> carved stones that depicted significant events in Hatshepsut's life.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} walls and ceilings of the observatory building <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> fibre-cement sheeting with timber cover strips.

50|$|The northern, rear {{facade of}} the building, <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a modern steel framed {{verandah}} which {{is linked to the}} rear verandahs of the adjacent buildings on the site. This facade <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> early timber framed window openings and early doors, with some more recent penetrations.|$|R
25|$|The Chao Praya, {{connecting}} the fortress of Bangkok to the sea, <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> numerous forts, and was blocked at its mouth with {{five to six}} rows of huge tree trunks, an iron chain and numerous embarkations. Altogether, there were seven batteries, containing 180 cannons.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Strand, which connects the City of London with the royal centre of Westminster, <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> the mansions {{of some of}} England's richest prelates and noblemen. Most of the grandest houses were on the {{southern}} {{side of the road}} and had gardens stretching down to the River Thames.|$|E
25|$|Sala de Saxe (Saxe Room), <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> silk, {{the plaster}} ceiling is {{decorated}} with flowers, birds and butterflies; today its austere space is used to exhibit some toys and objects associated with the Infantes Carlos and Afonso. Located {{to the right of}} the Green Room, at one time there were Portuguese medallions and paintings of Italian landscapes.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{religious}} observances {{that took place}} at the Akademeia was a torchlit night race from altars within the city to Prometheus’ altar in the Akademeia. The road to Akademeia <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> the gravestones of Athenians, and funeral games also took place in the area as well as a Dionysiac procession from Athens to the Hekademeia and then back to the city.|$|E
25|$|His body {{left the}} family home at Cregagh Road, East Belfast, shortly after 10:00UTC on Saturday, 3 December 2005. The cortege then {{travelled}} the short distance to Stormont. The route <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> around 100,000 mourners. Former Northern Ireland manager Billy Bingham, international teammates Derek Dougan, Peter McParland, Harry Gregg, Gerry Armstrong and Denis Law {{were the first to}} carry the coffin {{to the base of the}} Stormont steps.|$|E
25|$|In 1859 William Prest was {{involved}} {{with the formation of}} the 2nd West Yorkshire Rifles, better known as the Hallamshire Rifles. He {{was involved}} with the battalion until his death and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He died on 10 February 1885 (aged 52) due to a seizure caused by a burst blood vessel. His funeral was held at Sheffield General Cemetery three days later with full military honours. The route <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> several thousand mourners.|$|E

25|$|Three {{principal}} {{kinds of}} docks existed. Wet docks were where ships were laid up at anchor and loaded or unloaded. Dry docks, which were far smaller, took individual ships for repairing. Ships were built at dockyards along the riverside. In addition, the river <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> innumerable warehouses, piers, jetties and dolphins (mooring points). The various docks tended to specialise in {{different forms of}} produce. The Surrey Docks concentrated on timber, for instance; Millwall took grain; St Katharine took wool, sugar and rubber; and so on.|$|E
25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the frock coat {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as broadcloth. The standard colour of a frock coat was solid black, but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
25|$|Leakage was {{affected}} by springs breaking through the clay lining of the canal bed. In summer when the springs receded, water was lost through these holes at a rate greater than the available supply. In one of the attempts to rectify this problem, {{the size of the}} locks was reduced which resulted in their unusual double headed appearance. In a further attempt to prevent water loss, at King's Reach, the section immediately east of Sapperton Tunnel, the canal <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> concrete rather than puddle clay.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} {{walls of the}} church <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> horizontal tongue and groove boarding. The floor is of ironbark. The flat ceiling <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> timber boards. The altar recess on {{the eastern end of}} the building has a lower ceiling which has truncated corners, reflecting the pitch of the external gabled projection.|$|R

25|$|From the hall, a large granite door {{led to an}} open courtyard, which <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> 16 {{monolithic}} pink granite columns {{supporting a}} monumental granite architrave. These columns were carved so as to resemble the trunk and crown of a palm tree, which {{was regarded as a}} fertility and eternity symbol. According to Herbert Ricke, these columns represent the sacred palm grove of Buto. Here again, Sahure's temple served as an example for his successors: plantiform columns became the standard for columns of pyramid temples throughout {{the second half of the}} Old Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Thorneloe's funeral {{took place}} on 16 July 2009. At about 11:00 BST (10:00 UTC) the hearse {{carrying}} his coffin passed through Aldershot Barracks which <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> Guardsmen. The hearse then travelled to the Guards Chapel at Wellington Barracks, London. The bearing party consisting of eight members of the Welsh Guards then shouldered the coffin and carried it into the chapel. On his coffin were placed his scabbard, sword, cap, belt and medals along with a wreath of white roses. The service began at 12:45 BST, attended by the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Des Browne, and Thorneloe's family including his father, Major John Thorneloe.|$|E
25|$|The eastern {{segment of}} the Kremlin wall, and Red Square behind it, emerged on its present site in the 15th century, {{during the reign of}} Ivan III; the wall and the square were {{separated}} with a wide defensive moat filled with water diverted from the Neglinnaya River. The moat <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a secondary fortress wall, and spanned by three bridges connecting the Kremlin to the posad. From 1707–1708 Peter the Great, expecting a Swedish incursion deep into the Russian mainland, restored the moat around the Kremlin, cleared Red Square and built earthen fortifications around Nikolskaya and Spasskaya towers. From 1776–1787 Matvey Kazakov built the Kremlin Senate that today provides a backdrop for the present-day Necropolis.|$|E
