It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time.

Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E

When Norvell and John Walker founded The Inquirer they wanted the newspaper to represent all people {{and not just the}} higher classes.

2500|$|... {{the large}} {{majority}} of French jihadists are second-generation Muslims who, unlike their parents, speak French, grew up with little to no contact with mosques or Muslim organizations, and before their conversions drank, took drugs, and had girlfriends. They are estranged from their parents and don't know where to fit in. Or they are recent converts, largely from rural areas and many from divorced families. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> Roy asks? If Islam or social conditions are essentially to blame for breeding terrorism, why do such structural problems affect only this very narrowly defined group? Why does it not attract first- or third-generation French Muslims, or those whose Islamic culture is the deepest? And why does its appeal extend to children of the successful middle class? His answer: jihadism is a nihilistic generational revolt, not a religiously inspired utopianism.|$|E
2500|$|If one is then {{to look at}} the {{interpretation}} (or, meaning), which inheres at the particular time period, the question becomes: <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> reading the essential one?. Or, restated, an essential reading, then, is owing to whom? Is it owing, then, to the meaning derived by the average person at that time? The collective intent of the voters who passed it?

2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2013 that {{networks}} are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains {{may also be}} breaking up ("deconstructing") where information aspects can be separated from functional activity. Data that is readily available for free or very low cost {{makes it harder for}} information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: [...] "The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate." [...] He used Wikipedia {{as an example of a}} network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model. Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a [...] "stack", analogous to a technology stack, in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.|$|E

(How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children.
