40|$|As cereal aphids {{are only}} present during 2 - 3 {{months per year}} in cereal crops, their parasitoids rely on {{alternative}} hosts to complete their life cycle. These parasitoids often have the same aphid hosts, which leads to apparent competition. Development on alternative host may increase parasitoid abundance and consequently increase their pressure on cereal aphids. Intensive agriculture frequently reduces the availability of non-crop habitats where alternative aphids may be present. The apparent competition hypothesis was examined in two traditional wheat plots compared to two other plots, with strips of alternative host aphids on leguminosae (red clover and alfalfa) and graminae (ryegrass and meadow fescue). In June/July, parasitism on <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> (Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae, and Rhopalosiphum padi) was higher in 1998 than in 1997, in all the plots studied. During summer 1998, significantly more parasitised <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> were found in strip-designed plots than in the controls, and this higher parasitism rate was positively correlated to a higher parasitoid activity during May, due {{to the presence of}} alternative hosts. The interaction between <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> in summer and aphids in the strips in spring is an example of apparent competition, mediated by shared parasitoids. Alternative hosts allow parasitoids to increase their numbers and consequently to apply a higher pressure on <b>aphids</b> in <b>wheat</b> crops. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Aphelinus is a genus of {{parasitoid}} wasps.

50|$|The Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> (Diuraphis noxia) is an aphid {{that can}} cause {{significant}} losses in cereal crops. The species {{was introduced to the}} United States in 1986 and is considered an invasive species there. This aphid is pale green and up to 2 mm long. Cornicles are very short, rounded, and appear to be lacking. There is an appendage above the cauda giving the aphid the appearance of having two tails. The saliva of this aphid is toxic to the plant and causes whitish striping on cereal leaves. Feeding by this aphid will also cause the flag leaf to turn white and curl around the head causing incomplete head emergence. Host plants: cereal grain crops including wheat and barley and to a lesser extent, wild grasses such as wheatgrasses, brome-grasses, ryegrasses and anything in the grass family.|$|E
50|$|Jointed goatgrass {{can reduce}} the yield of winter wheat by 25 - 50% which can cost US farmers up to $145 million. Another problem is that winter wheat {{provides}} an overwinter home for winter wheat attacking pests such as Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid,</b> leaf spot, pink mold, foot rot, dwarf bunt, fron, root browning, damping off, and kernel bunt.When the spikes shatter, the disjointed spikelets are cylindrical in shape and are easily mistaken for small pieces of winter wheat straw. Since the spikelets are similar in shape and size to winter wheat seeds, {{it is difficult to}} separate them from the wheat using conventional methods. Better methods use length graders or weight tables, but these are slow and costly to operate. The Official United States Standards for Grain states that when the spikelets get mixed in with the winter wheat, the wheat is considered contaminated and the grade is reduced, resulting in a penalty. The more jointed goatgrass found in the wheat, the lower the grade and the larger the penalty. The lowest penalty is $0.02 per bushel while the highest is $0.15 per bushel.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : GIS, GPS, RS and Precision FarmingInternational audienceThis {{study is}} to {{identify}} leaf-scale <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> using the near-ground hyperspectral Pushbroom Imaging Spectrometer (PIS). Firstly, the spectral characteristics between normal and aphid-infested wheat leaves were compared in spectral reflectance. Concerning the serious aphid damage level, {{it is obvious that}} its spectral curve is badly flattened such as green peak (centered around 550 nm), red valley (centered around 680 nm), due to the influence of aphid. Specifically, in the visible spectrum (500 - 701 nm), the maximum delta (the maximum value minus the minimum value) is 3. 3 and it is 7. 5 in the near-infrared spectrum (701 - 900 nm). Then, the spectral difference and change rate were further analyzed. It seems that both curves show the mirror symmetry and their maximum values are 55. 8 % and 17. 4 %, respectively. For the difference curve, the value is negative in the visible spectrum (400 - 700 nm), which shows that the reflectance of normal wheat leaf is less than that of the serious level. Conversely, it is greater in the near-infrared spectrum (700 - 900 nm). Finally, based on the high spatial resolution PIS image, ENvironment for Visualizing Images (ENVI-EX) was utilized to extract aphids and the overall accuracy reaches 97 %. The result indicates that the PIS is sufficient to identify the <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> and this study can lay a foundation for further applications in precision agriculture using such a hyperspectral imaging system...|$|R

40|$|Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid)</b> has severe {{economic}} impacts on wheat and barley {{production in the}} United States. The interaction between the Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and its cereal hosts is poorly understood. However, the recent appearance of new biotypes in the United States showed that specific interactions exist between wheat resistance loci and Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> biotypes. At present, Dn 7 is the only known gene in hexaploid wheat that confers resistance against all U. S. Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> biotypes. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the molecular mechanism of Dn 7 -mediated resistance against two U. S. Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> biotypes (Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 1 and Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 2). Using GeneChip Wheat Genome Arrays, we compared transcript profiles of resistant and susceptible lines infested with either Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 1 or Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 2 using two time intervals (5 and 48 h after infestation). Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding on hexaploid wheat led to the induction of groups of genes functioning in oxidative and general stress, photosynthesis, cell respiration and energy production, signal transduction, calcium- dependent signaling, pathogenesis related (PR) responses, and defense compound synthesis.

Resistant barley produced significantly more collapsed, autofluorescent cells (CAC) than did susceptible barley. RWA stylet entry sites and sheath paths also fluoresced, making them easy to observe in whole leaf sections. The number of CAC increased {{with the number of}} RWAs and with the number of days of feeding in resistant plants.

In arenas, D. noxia also responded to the proximity of cornicle-damaged nymphs of either the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), or of D. noxia, which suggests endogenous production of alarm pheromone by D. noxia. Combinations of (E) -β-farnesene and the aphid-pathogenic fungus Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Wize) Brown & Smith did not enhance aphid mortality relative to controls treated with fungus only.

40|$|Plants {{possess a}} complex and poorly {{understood}} network of defence mechanisms {{that enable them to}} counteract the effects of abiotic and biotic stress. Aphid phloem feeding is source of biotic stress in plants. Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid feeding cause significant losses in the annual wheat crop, and control by conventional methods such as pesticide application, has proved to be ineffective. Infestation by the Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> has a particularly devastating effect in South Africa. Aphid-resistant wheat cultivars have been identified but an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of the plant’s resistance thwarts the development of improved cultivars. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method was developed, partially optimised and validated {{in order to determine the}} effect of Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding on the Betta and Betta DN wheat proteome. Differentially expressed proteins that were up or down regulated more than two fold were identified using PDQuest™ Basic software and matched to known wheat proteins stored in the SwissProt protein database on the basis of their molecular mass and isolectric point. Initial analysis of the differential protein expression of Betta and Betta DN wheat in response to Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding at different growth stages revealed that younger plants display higher levels of resistance than older plants. Feeding by the Bird-Cherry Oat aphid does not result in the upregulation of proteins implicated in a defence response, which indicates that the damage incurred by the plant due to feeding by this aphid is not enough to trigger a classic defence response. Feeding by the more damaging Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> resulted in a stress response in susceptible wheat cultivar Betta, and a defence response in resistant wheat cultivar Betta DN. The infestation of Betta DN resulted in the upregulation of putative thaumatins and amylase trypsin inhibitors, indicating that the Betta DN resistance response could be due to the combined effect of protease inhibitors that discourage aphid phloem feeding and the activation of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid plant defence pathways...|$|E
40|$|Cereal aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are {{economically}} important pests in all wheat-producing {{regions of}} Brazil and about eight species {{can be found}} in <b>wheat</b> crops. <b>Aphids</b> acquired the condition of severe pest in wheat in the 1970 s, due to the emergence of Metopolophium dirhodum and Sitobion avenae. A successful biological control program of <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> was introduced in southern Brazil in 1978. This study describes temporal changes in aphid populations in a wheat producing area in the northern region of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state, Brazil. Data from weekly samples (water traps of Moericke type) for the current (May to November 2008, 2009 and 2010) population frequency of each species was compared with 1970 s populations. In addition, their seasonal fluctuations and the influence of rainfall and temperature on their populations were estimated.
