5|$|The band eschewed {{elaborate}} stage lighting during live sets, {{preferring to}} play under 40-watt household light bulbs; the technical difficulties of filming under such lighting conditions partly explains <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little live footage of Crass. They pioneered multimedia presentation, using video technology (back-projected films and video collages by Mick Duffield and Gee Vaucher) {{to enhance their}} performances, and also distributed leaflets and handouts explaining anarchist ideas to their audiences.|$|E
5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of lower {{government}} funding, Canadian cities have to recover a much higher share of their costs out of operating revenues.

25|$|Its {{supporters}} {{claim that}} FCC {{is the only}} Darwinian theory to explain <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> so much red ochre in the early archaeological record of modern humans and why modern humans are then associated with red ochre wherever they went as they emerged from Africa.

25|$|The Van der Waals {{radius of}} the {{fluorine}} substituent is only 1.47 Å, which is shorter {{than in any other}} substituent and is close to that of hydrogen (1.2 Å). This, together with the short bond length, is the reason <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no steric strain in polyfluorinated compounds. This is another reason for their high thermal stability. In addition, the fluorine substituents in polyfluorinated compounds efficiently shield the carbon skeleton from possible attacking reagents. This is another reason for the high chemical stability of polyfluorinated compounds.|$|E
25|$|Criticism of {{this model}} arises from its {{inability}} to explain <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a delay between the onset of referred pain after local pain stimulation. Experimental evidence also shows that referred pain is often unidirectional. For example, stimulated local pain in the anterior tibial muscle causes referred pain in the ventral portion of the ankle; however referred pain moving {{in the opposite direction}} has not been shown experimentally. Lastly, the threshold for the local pain stimulation and the referred pain stimulation are different, but according to this model they should both be the same.|$|E

25|$|Other {{numerical}} abnormalities discovered include {{sex chromosome}} abnormalities. A female {{with only one}} Xchromosome has Turner syndrome, whereas an additional Xchromosome in a male, resulting in 47 total chromosomes, has Klinefelter Syndrome. Many other sex chromosome combinations are compatible with live birth including XXX, XYY, and XXXX. The ability for mammals to tolerate aneuploidies in the sex chromosomes arises from the ability to inactivate them, which is required in normal females to compensate for having two copies of the chromosome. Not all genes on the Xchromosome are inactivated, which is <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a phenotypic effect seen in individuals with extra Xchromosomes.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes' intent {{was not to}} analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external world, we can only know our sensations. Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes' iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) helps to explain <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, {{and how it was}} possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.|$|E
25|$|While Ruffini and Abel {{established}} that the general quintic could not be solved, some particular quintics can be solved, such as (x1)5=0, and the precise criterion by which a given quintic or higher polynomial could be determined to be solvable or not was given by Évariste Galois, who showed that whether a polynomial was solvable or not was equivalent {{to whether or not}} the permutation group of its roots – in modern terms, its Galois group – had a certain structure – in modern terms, whether or not it was a solvable group. This group was always solvable for polynomials of degree four or less, but not always so for polynomials of degree five and greater, which explains <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no general solution in higher degree.|$|E

According to the ILC, the reasons <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> problems with reservations against human rights were the same reasons <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> problems with reservations against other treaties. Therefore, the ILC decided that no special regime for human rights treaties would be required.|$|R
