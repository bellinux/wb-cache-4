60|$|As soon as {{he could}} do so naturally, Arthur asked after Margaret. The <b>woman</b> <b>shrugged</b> her shoulders. No one knew {{anything}} about her. She never came out of the park gates, but sometimes you could see her wandering about inside by herself. She saw no one. Haddo had long since quarrelled with the surrounding gentry; and though one old lady, the mother of a neighbouring landowner, had called when Margaret first came, she had not been admitted, and the visit was never returned.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{his lady}} {{left alone in}} the country? Poor lady! But your English ladies like the country. They are fond of the fields and the daisies. So they say; but I think often they lie. Me; I like the houses, and the people, and the pave. The fields are damp, and I love not {{rheumatism}} at all." [...] Then the little <b>woman</b> <b>shrugged</b> her shoulders and shook herself. [...] "Tell us the truth, Julie; which do you like best, the town or the country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it." [...] The <b>woman</b> revolutionist <b>shrugged</b> her {{shoulders}} in disgust. [...] "She died without making a will. A lot of nephews and nieces came down from St. Petersburg, like a flock of vultures, and fought for her money amongst themselves. All beastly Kammerherrs and Maids of Honour--abominable court flunkeys. Tfui!" ...|$|R

50|$|A shrug is a cropped, cardigan-like garment {{with short}} or long sleeves, {{typically}} knitted, usually for <b>women.</b> Generally, a <b>shrug</b> covers {{less of the}} body than a vest would, {{but it is more}} tailored than a shawl. Shrugs are typically worn as the outermost layer of an outfit, with a full shirt, tank top, or dress beneath.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>woman</b> <b>shrugged</b> her shoulders. [...] "It is {{his name}} that is all I know." [...] He had begun to speak again, and now in English, with an enunciation, a {{distinctive}} manner of turning his phrases new to such gatherings in America, where labour intellectuals are little known; surprising to Janet, diverting her attention, at first, from the meaning of his words. [...] "Labour," [...] she heard, [...] "labour is the creator of all wealth, and wealth belongs to the creator. The wage system must be abolished. You, the creators, must do battle against these self-imposed masters until you shall come into your own. You who toil miserably for nine hours and produce, let us say, nine dollars of wealth--do you receive it? No, what is given you is barely {{enough to keep the}} slave and the slave's family alive! The master, the capitalist, seizes the rightful reward of your labour and spends it on luxuries, on automobiles and fine houses and women, on food he can't eat, while you are hungry. Yes, you are slaves," [...] he cried, [...] "because you submit like slaves." ...|$|E
