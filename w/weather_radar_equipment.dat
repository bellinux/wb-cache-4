This successful flight testing moves NASA closer to its goal of developing advanced communications and information technologies to enable high-quality and timely dissemination of aviation weather information to all relevant users on the aviation information network. Recognized as a major contributing factor in aviation accidents and incidents, weather contributes directly or indirectly to nearly 80 percent of fatal general aviation (small private aircraft) accidents. In 1997, the Aeronautics Safety Investment Strategy Team s weather team produced a prioritized list of investment areas under weather accident prevention. Weather data dissemination is the most critical and highest ranked priority on the list. NASA's Aviation Safety Program founded the Aviation Weather Information initiative to focus efforts on significantly {{reducing the number of}} weather-related aviation fatalities. Access to accurate and timely weather data could contribute to a major reduction of weather-related incidents and accidents. However, a cost-effective solution has eluded most general aviation pilots because of the high cost of onboard <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>equipment.</b> Rockwell Collins, through a contract with NASA and in cooperation with WorldSpace Corporation, successfully completed ground and flight testing of a receiver and antenna in Johannesburg, South Africa. This NASA/Rockwell Collins project is an evaluation of worldwide weather data-link capability using transmissions from the Satellite Digital Audio Radio Services (S DARS) AfriStar satellite. Owned and operated by WorldSpace, AfriStar is a geostationary satellite that broadcasts commercial digital audio services to stationary and mobile platforms. S DARS satellites are the most powerful communications satellites produced to date, allowing users to receive signals using simple, low-cost patch antennas instead of more expensive, beam-steered antenna arrays. Engineers connected an inexpensive, commercially available radio receiver to a laptop computer and an antenna designed and built by Rockwell Collins, enabling them to receive WorldSpace signals from the AfriStar satellite during flight tests. WorldSpace broadcast their composite color graphical weather data files, which were multiplexed with normal audio streams, to the flat patch antenna mounted on a single-engine aircraft. The aircraft was equipped with a modified commercial S-DARS receiver, a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver, and a laptop computer with color display. Continuous data reception occurred during normal aircraft maneuvers performed throughout takeoff, cruise, and landing operations. In addition, engineers monitored receiver power levels during steep turns and banks. In most instances, the receiver was able to maintain acceptable power levels during all phases of flight and to obtain weather data with little or with the successful completion of ground and flight testing of a receiver and antenna in Johannesburg, South Africa, the team has started to prepare for experiments using highspeed aircraft in areas of the world with limited access to timely weather data. NASA plans to provide a more advanced antenna design and consultation support. This successful test of real-time aviation-related weather data is a positive step toward solving communications-specific issues associated with the dissemination of weather data directly to the cockpit...|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as wireless local area networks and cellular telephones have dramatically increased the use of wireless communications services within the last 10 years. The shortage of available spectrum exists due to increasing demand for wireless services and current spectrum allocation regulations. To alleviate this shortage, Research aims to improve spectral efficiency and to allow spectrum sharing between separately managed and non-coordinating communications systems. This thesis explores the feasibility of spectrum sharing between airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and wireless local area networks at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz. Characteristics of flight paths of aircraft using airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and the low duty cycle of radar transmissions offer unique opportunities for spectrum sharing. But {{it was found that}} the extremely sensitive receivers provide challenges for designing a communications system meant for widespread use. The probability of causing harmful interference to airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> is too great for most types of wireless local area networks, but a direct sequence spread spectrum scheme could share spectrum with airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar.</b> Bit errors in wireless local area network links caused by airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> interference do not significantly decrease the performance of the wireless local area network system. The distribution of interference outside of the airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> receiver by using direct sequence spread spectrum combined with the acceptable bit error rates indicate that while spectrum sharing between airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and wireless local area network at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz is not feasible, direct sequence spread spectrum systems can share spectrum with airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> under more limited assumptions...|$|R

The method calculates rain rates from cloud liquid water path (LWP), particle effective radius, cloud thermodynamic phase and cloud top height. The accuracy of the precipitation detection and rain rate retrievals from SEVIRI is evaluated with <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> observations. Rain rates from SEVIRI are compared against <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> observations for an area over Northern Europe and a two month period. The <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> observations are used to validate the instantaneous rain rate retrievals and accumulated rainfall sums (precipitation depths) across the entire study area and period. In addition, we evaluate the ability of SEVIRI to discriminate precipitating from non-precipitating clouds. The results show very high agreement (corr. ~ 0. 90) between amounts of precipitating clouds detected from <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> and SEVIRI observations. Although weaker correlations (corr. ~ 0. 63) are found between the rain rate retrievals from <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> and SEVIRI, the SEVIRI-retrievals still have an acceptable accuracy of about 0. 2 mm hr- 1 and a precision of about 0. 7 mm hr- 1.
