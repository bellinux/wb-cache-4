Beginning from the considerations of Michel de Certeau concerning {{the practices of}} cultural consumption, the "reactionary" character, generally attributed to the educational pedagogic practices, is questioned {{in opposition to the}} "revolutionary" tenor that is usually associated to the academic-education speeches. The theme is discussed starting from data gathered in the extent of an ethnographic investigation that focused the reading practices accomplished by teachers inside a program of continuous formation. The results of that study emphasize the existence of specificities in the teaching culture that can be noticed in the ways the teachers conceive the teaching and (re) invent it in the school daily life. The consideration of such aspects makes possible to identify certain limits for the performance of the university in the innovation of the pedagogic practices and in the movement, now in course, of the teaching professionalization. The university is challenged, therefore, to create new forms of relating with the teachers and of acting in his/her professional development...|$|E

Analyzing the trope from a number of angles, including disability, factory labor practices, mass production, and marketing, the author scrutinizes ways in which technologies are simultaneously wound-ing and enabling in <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> prosthesis trope cannot account. Freud ([1930] 1962) echoed a common teleological fantasy of the prom-ises of prostheses by pronouncing: With every tool man is perfecting his own organs, whether motor or sensory, or is removing the limits to their functioning [...] Man has, as it were, become a prosthetic god. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs he is truly magnificent: but those organs have not grown on him and they still give him much trouble at times. (p. 42) Freud’s hesitant caveat surely referred to his own prosthesis, a palate replac-ing an original that was removed as a result of throat cancer in 1923. His pros-thesis, without which he could neither speak nor eat, caused him immense pain. Yet, if he went without it for more than two hours, the tissue circum-scribing the chasm between the mouth and nasal cavity would shrink—necessitating yet another agonizing fitting session and prosthesis (Wills 1995). 1 Freud’s speculations on godlike magnificence stem, perhaps...|$|E

The observations were taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys instrument on-board the Hubble Space Telescope, and reach down to the horizontal branch. In this relatively small 3. 8 × 3. 8 kpc 2 field, after correcting for Poisson noise, we do not find any statistically strong evidence for the presence of small-scale substructures in the stellar spatial distribution on scales 100 pc. However, we do detect the presence of significant small spatial-scale inhomogeneities in the stellar median metallicity over the surveyed field. We argue that these localized chemical substructures could be associated with not fully mixed debris from the disruption of low-mass systems.

Exploration of the uterus in the infertile patient should implement {{the evaluation of the}} endometrium, the Junctional zone myometrium (JZ), the outer myometrium and the cervical canal. Especially the JZ myometrium should receive our close attention in the exploration and treatment of the infertile patient.

Modern ambulatory uterine diagnosis in a one-stop approach includes transvaginal ultrasound, fluid mini Hysteroscopy, contrast sonography and endomyometrial tissue sampling. Transvaginal Ultrasound being the gold standard for global uterine screening has a cardinal importance for diagnosis of myometrial disorders and uterine congenital malformations whereas hysteroscopy remains the gold standard for the evaluation of the endometrium and cervical canal.

40|$|Theme 2 At {{the end of}} the eighties, several French conurbations {{considered}} {{calling on}} private companies to construct public transport lines with right of way 1. Some ten years after the signature of the first statutory contracts, and faced with a growing number of public transport projects in French conurbations, we feel it necessary to take stock of how these contracts have weathered and how other French conurbations intend to construct their metros, LRTs and bus lines with right of way. Therefore this study recounts the organisation of promoters and the financing of public transport with right of way in sixteen French conurbations with populations from 125, 000 to 1, 150, 000. It appears that the great majority of French conurbations no longer commit themselves to public-private partnerships and conurbations such as Toulouse or Rouen have reversed their choice regarding the statutory contracts that they had granted for a first line. Growing numbers of public partners are asked to finance projects, leading to financing of certain projects by more than five such bodies.

As a result, Khovanov homology does not yield an invariant of two-fold branched covers. Mutation provides an easy method for producing distinct knots sharing a common two-fold branched cover: the mutation in the branch set corresponds to a trivial surgery in the cover. Due to a result of Wehrli [17, 18] (see also Bloom [2]), this provides a range of examples of manifolds that branch cover S 3 {{in more than one}} <b>way,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> distinct branch sets have identical rank in their respective Khovanov homology groups over F = Z/ 2 Z. From this point of view this fact is not completely surprising, as Khovanov homology is closely related to the Heegaard-Floer homology of two-fold branched covers [12]. Indeed, this is made precise in Bloom’s proof of mutation invariance [2]. More generally however, the following question has been posed by Ozsváth [6]: is Khovanov homology an invariant of the two-fold branched cover? To be precise, this question asks if the total rank of the reduced Khovanov homology (over F) might be an invariant of two-fold branched covers. This arises naturally in relation to the open problem of extending Khovanov’s invariant to manifolds other than S 3 [6, 11]. This short note gives a negative answer. Theorem. The total rank of Khovanov homology is not an invariant of two-fold branched covers. This theorem is proved by example: we construct manifolds that are two-fold branched covers of S 3 in two different <b>ways,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> pair of branch sets is distinguished by the total rank in Khovanov homology.
