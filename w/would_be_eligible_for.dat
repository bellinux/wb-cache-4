5|$|Always {{interested}} in military history, Kippenberger joined the local {{unit of the}} New Zealand Cadet Corps and found that he enjoyed soldiering. His father did not approve of his interest but regardless, Kippenberger enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in late 1915 {{at the age of}} 18. Because only men between the ages of 19 and 45 were required to register for service, he falsified his age to ensure that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> duty overseas.|$|E

Because only men {{between the ages of}} 19 and 45 were {{required}} to register for service with the NZEF, he falsified his age to ensure that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> duty overseas. A member of the 12th Reinforcements, he embarked for the Western Front via Egypt on 1 May 1916. In France, he was posted to B Company, Wellington Infantry Battalion with the rank of private.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Manning {{left the}} family in 1869 after selling most of the family's realty to his wife. There is no {{evidence}} that suggests that Isaac had any permanent relations with any members of the family again. Within four years James was remarried to her son Sylvester's father-in-law, Frank Perkins. The marriage lasted less than two years, after which time she reverted to her former married name. It was at this time that James became increasingly worried about her eternal welfare. She began to petition the First Presidency to be endowed and to be sealed, along with her children, to Walker Lewis, a prominent African-American Mormon Elder. Lewis, like Elijah Abel, had been ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime, and James therefore assumed that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> temple ordinances. However, her petitions were consistently ignored or refused.|$|E
5|$|To {{play for}} an inter-county GAA team, Canavan {{had to work}} around a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) bylaw, because of a dispute in his parish, Errigal Ciarán. Two clubs claimed to {{represent}} the parish, the established Ballygawley St. Ciaran's club and the newly formed club, then called Errigal Ciaran Naomh Malachai. Players from the Errigal team were not recognised as being GAA members, because the club failed to register correctly. Canavan registered {{as a member of}} the Killyclogher hurling club, even though he didn't play the sport, just so he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> selection for the Tyrone minors. Prior to that, he had not played legitimate club football, but had forged his way onto the Tyrone under-age teams with his performances at school level. The two clubs united under the banner of Errigal Ciaran two years later.|$|E
5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint {{director}} by James Kimball. The {{new director}} was {{more receptive to}} Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new designs for the non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint's authority to produce new designs. The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and {{had in the past}} introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could not be done without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> redesign in 1916.|$|E

25|$|At the time, the Nobel Prize in Physics did not {{recognize}} work done in astronomy. Hubble {{spent much of the}} later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered an area of physics, instead of being its own science. He did this largely so that astronomers—including himself—could be recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee for their valuable contributions to astrophysics. This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble's lifetime, but shortly after his death, the Nobel Prize Committee decided that astronomical work <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> the physics prize.
