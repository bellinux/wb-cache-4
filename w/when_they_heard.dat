5|$|The Argives revolted <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> that Sparta {{was under}} siege. Under the Argive Archippas, they {{attacked}} the garrison commanded by Timocrates of Pellene. Timocrates surrendered the citadel {{on condition that}} he and his men could leave unharmed. In return all the Argives serving in Nabis' army were allowed to return home.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the Muslim army once again sought refuge in Mineo, where Theodotus {{blockaded}} them and soon reduced them {{to the point of}} eating their horses and even dogs. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> of this reversal, the Arab garrison of Agrigento abandoned the city and retreated to Mazara. Thus, by the autumn of 829, Sicily had almost been cleared of the Muslim invaders.|$|E

5|$|The Natchez had {{prepared}} by seizing the galley of the West India Company anchored on the river, {{so that no}} Frenchmen could board it and attempt to escape. They had also stationed warriors {{on the other side}} of the river to intercept those who might flee in that direction. The commandant at the Yazoo trading post of Fort St. Pierre, Monsieur du Codère, was visiting Fort Rosalie with a Jesuit priest <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> gunshots. They turned around to return to their ship, but warriors caught up with them, killing and scalping them.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, {{the regulars}} and militia {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search for}} Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at {{not being able to}} find the British Band. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families. As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the prince and princess had got a good start, and were feeling quite happy, <b>when</b> {{suddenly}} <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> {{the sound of a}} gallop far behind them. The prince sprang from the saddle, and laid his ear to the ground.|$|R
5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E
5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, {{and more often}} in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which time {{they are more likely}} to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (Falco longipennis), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> the recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I. In early September, {{it was decided to}} bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.|$|E

60|$|With this {{addition}} to the food already on hand, the boys started in {{to have a real}} good dinner. They were enjoying it thoroughly and cracking all kinds of jokes <b>when</b> <b>they</b> suddenly <b>heard</b> a commotion in the corridor outside.|$|R
5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> shots. He went to see what was happening, and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's editing {{of works}} by The Five is significant. It was a {{practical}} extension of the collaborative atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> each other's compositions in progress and worked on them together, and {{was an effort to}} save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely. This work included the completion of Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor, which Rimsky-Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin's death, and the orchestration of passages from César Cui's William Ratcliff for its first production in 1869. He also completely orchestrated the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Dargomyzhsky three times—in 1869–70, 1892 and 1902. While not a member of The Five himself, Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared their musical philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park had {{the worst}} fan safety record in Britain before its {{complete}} redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13, resulting in a crush. Stairway 13 was a popular, often overcrowded, and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters' coaches. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on Stairway 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> the roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling {{in the same direction}} when the crush happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush.|$|E
50|$|Flashbulb {{memories}} are clear episodic memories of unique and highly emotional events. People remembering {{where they were}} or what <b>they</b> were doing <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>heard</b> the news of President Kennedy's assassination, the Sydney Siege or of 9/11 are examples of flashbulb memories.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{found the}} moving picture theater pretty well crowded, {{and they had}} to take seats almost in the rear. Tom and Sam were once more enjoying the {{spectacle}} of looking at themselves <b>when</b> <b>they</b> suddenly <b>heard</b> a young man behind them utter an exclamation.|$|R

25|$|The Jin Shu {{mentioned}} that Chen Shou fell sick during the filial mourning period after his father's death. Some guests who visited his home expressed disapproval {{when they saw}} him being served medicine by his servants, because {{he was expected to}} lead an austere life during that period.

Potter and director Tom Donovan) met at the Young & Rubicam ad agency in New York to discuss the show's opening story, the death of William Matthews, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> the news of another death in Dallas: the assassination of President Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|SNCC {{had severe}} {{reservations}} about the march, especially <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> that King would not be present. They permitted John Lewis to participate, and SNCC provided logistical support, {{such as the use}} of its Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) lines and the services of the Medical Committee on Human Rights, organized by SNCC during the Mississippi Summer Project of 1964.|$|E
25|$|The Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971 {{enabled the}} Court of Session to {{regulate}} the sheriff courts and Sheriff Appeal Court <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>heard</b> civil matters. The Act also dissolved the Sheriff Court Rules Council created by the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933, and created a new Sheriff Court Rules Council to continually review sheriff court procedure and submit to the Court of Session draft Acts of Sederunt for regulating sheriff courts.|$|E
