5|$|From {{the early}} 1860s whaling {{declined}} rapidly {{with the increasing}} use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War – with unfortunate consequences for the island.

Cagney Productions was not a great success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, A Lion Is in the Streets, the company came to an end.|$|E

By the 1980s, however, Martinican zouk and other styles were more popular. In 1988, WCK formed, playing an {{experimental}} fusion of cadence-lypso with the island’s jing ping sound. The result became known as bouyon, and has re-established Dominica in the field of popular music.|$|E
