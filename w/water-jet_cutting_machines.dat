40|$|Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) {{adopted in}} TV sets and {{computer}} monitors represent a consistent portion of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). In {{comparison with the}} recycling of WEEE such as refrigerators or washing machines, the recovery process for CRT containing devices is very difficult. CRTs are composed of four types of glass (panel, funnel, neck and frit seal) with different compositions. Furthermore, dangerous substances are contained within (i. e. lead, barium, strontium and fluorescent dust). Hence, the need to define robust processes for the design and implementation of efficient facilities for CRT cutting arises.

In converging polyethyleneoxide solution flow macromolecules are forced by a hydrodynamic field to rather strong stretching that causes the dynamic structure formation in solutions. There have been studied experimentally velocity fields and their gradients {{as well as the}} degree of macromolecule unrolling under pattern conditions of a jet-shaping head in poluyethyleneoxide solutions flow. In converging polymer solution flow macromolecules are forced by a hydrodynamic field to rather strong (~ 60 % and more) stretching that causes the field restructuring. The determined regularities of macromolecules behavior in the flow under conditions of a jet-shaping head and manifested in this case effects of elastic deformations have paramount importance in understanding the mechanism of «anomalously» high cutting power of water-polymer jet. The work for the first time makes it possible to explain the nature of increased <b>water-jet</b> <b>cutting</b> power with polymer additions when cutting food products. Understanding the nature of increased cutting power of water-polymer jet will make it possible to develop recommendations on choosing regimes for water-polymer jet processing of food products by cutting. </p...|$|R

40|$|We show {{experimentally}} {{that there}} are two sources of ripple formation in abrasive <b>water-jet</b> <b>cutting.</b> Ripples can be triggered externally by periodic pressure oscillations, e. g. due to the pump, or they can be generated intrinsically. The latter is due to a spontaneous front instability as described by the nonlinear evolution equations for the cutting front. By including oscillatory motion of the beam, or equivalently oscillations in the beam intensity, we are able to explain on the one hand resonance phenomena between intrinsic and external ripple-formin mechanisms. On the other hand the same approach leads to a strategy for ripple suppression if the corresponding frequencies are well separated...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine.</b> The first drive is a classic rack and pinion drive for <b>cutting</b> <b>machines.</b> To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position. In the fourth step, an experiment was designed and conducted to explore the positioning accuracy and the repeatable positioning accuracy...|$|R
