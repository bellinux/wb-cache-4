500|$|Since its release, The Blair Witch Project {{has been}} widely {{regarded}} by many as an influence to an array of subsequent films similarly using the found footage concept and the conventions the film established. These include Paranormal Activity and REC (both in 2007), Cloverfield (2008), The Last Exorcism and Trollhunter (both in 2010), Chronicle, Project X, V/H/S , and End of Watch (all in 2012), and The Den (2013). Some critics have also noted the film as being strikingly similar to Cannibal Holocaust (1980), and The Last Broadcast (1998) in terms of basic plot premise and narrative style. Although Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato has acknowledged the similarities of The Blair Witch Project to his film, he criticized the publicity that it received for being an original production; advertisements for The Blair Witch Project also promoted {{the idea that the}} footage is genuine. Despite initial reports by media outlets such as the New York Post and E! Entertainment that The Last Broadcast creators, Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler, had alleged that The Blair Witch Project was a complete rip-off of their work and would sue Haxan Films for copyright infringement, they repudiated these allegations. One of the creators told IndieWire in 1999, [...] "If somebody enjoys The Blair Witch Project there is a chance they will enjoy our film, and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> will check it out." ...|$|E

60|$|In conclusion, Mr. Marzials expresses {{his belief}} that a century hence Dickens will be read {{as much as we}} now read Scott, and says rather prettily that as long as he is read 'there will be one gentle and humanising {{influence}} the more at work among men,' which is always a useful tag to append to the life of any popular author. Remembering that of all forms of error prophecy is the most gratuitous, we will not take upon ourselves to decide the question of Dickens's immortality. If our descendants do not read him they will miss a great source of amusement, and if they do, <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> will not model their style upon his. Of this, however, there is but little danger, for no age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor. As for 'the gentle and humanising influence,' this is taking Dickens just a little too seriously.|$|E

It may, for instance, be possible for trade unions to keep their vacant-book in some cases at the exchanges. The structure of those Exchanges may in some cases be such as to enable us to have rooms which can be let to trade unions at a rent, for benefit and other meetings, {{so as to avoid}} the necessity under which all but the strongest unions lie at the present time of conducting their meetings in licensed premises. The Exchanges may, as they develop, afford facilities for washing, clothes-mending, and for non-alcoholic refreshments to persons who are attending them. Separate provision will be made for men and for women, and for skilled and for unskilled labour. Boy labour will be dealt with in conjunction with the local Education Authorities; and travelling expenses may be advanced on loan, if the management of the Exchange think fit, to persons for whom situations have been found.|$|E

40|$|The United States {{ranks in}} the lower tiers of OECD {{countries}} in life expectancy, and recent studies indicate that socioeconomic inequalities in health have been widening in the past decades.
