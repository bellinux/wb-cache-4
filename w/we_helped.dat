They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.' It wasn't like <b>we</b> <b>helped</b> ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention. [...] We said {{a lot of things that}} people wanted to say but didn't say. We talked about a lot of political and social [...] that people didn't want to talk about." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their lasting {{influence}} on modern music, the band {{has attempted to}} disassociate themselves {{with many of the}} bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, [...] "The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place... If this is the world <b>we</b> <b>helped</b> create, then I apologise."

Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: [...] "We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop."" [...] Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he [...] "no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: [...] "He (Dworsky) made a lot of money.

500|$|The Get Up Kids {{were viewed}} {{throughout}} their existence as a prototypical emo band, having been {{major players in}} the Midwest emo movement of the mid-1990s. Their second album Something to Write Home About remains their most widely acclaimed album, and is considered {{to be one of the}} quintessential albums of the second-wave emo movement. However, like many early emo bands, The Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves with the term, as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an [...] "emo band." [...] The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album On a Wire, which saw the band take on a much more layered, alternative rock sound. Years later, guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third-wave emo bands, commenting that [...] "he punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different.

[...] Following Lantos's lead a number of government officials protested Abdul Rahman's arrest. [...] Notably, President George W. Bush spoke out against Rahman's arrest, saying, [...] "It is deeply troubling that a country <b>we</b> <b>helped</b> liberate would hold a person to account because they chose a particular religion over another".

[...] Churchill said that as neither of them intended to live there after the war: [...] "… the less you and I worry about the form of Government they set up, the better.
