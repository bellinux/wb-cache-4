Well, the house I have already insured for five hundred, that makes nine hundred, and we'll insure the furniture and fixings for fifty; that'll look business-like, you know. Then the goods laid in will be carefully removed in the night at various times before the fire, so you had better see that they are small and portable objects; that'll make another fifty pounds, if not more. So I see my way to a thousand pounds. That's a neat sum, ain't it, Boone?" ...|$|E

That is the unwillingness to have a free exchange of ideas. The root cause of terrorism is totalitarianism.|$|E

A judge should just be there with a knowledge of the law and leave the lawyering to the lawyers." ...|$|E

Il Sole 24 Ores political analyst Stefano Folli said: [...] "...this is yet another reason for Italy to feel close to the reconfirmed leader the United States and Europe know they either stand together or fall together." [...] Nomisma research institute's Alessandro Politi agreed that the Eurozone's future depends on systemically managing dialogue with the United States to coordinate the differing economic policies of each of its member states. [...] "We need to stop losing time on personal interests. Obama's re-election gives Europe one more opportunity to help itself and to fix the crisis, but the single currency region has to grasp it with firmer belief."

On 20 May 2014, one week before the release, Lloyd made the album available for online stream on MTV.com. For the album, Lloyd worked with Beth Ditto and Tove Lo. In a July 2014 interview with Digital Spy, Lloyd spoke on being told by L.A. Reid {{to go back into}} the studio and create more [...] "magic". She stated, [...] "I think that sometimes the industry can panic and you have to be ready to take a risk, you know. If you're not taking a risk then <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> boring. You do need to go in and find your magic. I've taken many risks on this album and I didn't need to find any more magic, the album was done, ready and it's a bit of a pain in the arse that it got delayed. It's only my fans that suffer, and they have to wait longer for it. So it should have been brought out earlier." ...|$|E

5000|$|With {{the word}} [...] "stretch", Penny is {{referring}} to the editing effect {{of the same name}} in Photoshop. [...] "Anamorph" [...] is an optics term that refers to the illusion created when a distorted image appears as if is in normal perspective when viewed from a particular angle. Instead of working from a normal image, skewing it in Photoshop, and then rendering it in clay, as one might expect, Penny creates his three-dimensional sculptures from a skewed sketch of an imaginary character which he then moulds into clay. Penny describes the process in the following geometric terms. If you stretch out a cube by each of the eight corners in completely different directions and angles until there are no right angles or parallel lines left, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> a three-dimensional rhomboid. When viewed at a certain angle it may appear to be a normal cube, but physically it remains distorted. When photographed Penny’s sculptures can be compressed in Photoshop to create a very realistic two-dimensional image of a naturally proportioned person, but everything around them will be distorted.|$|E

[...] In a later interview on NPR's Studio 360, Williams stated he was raised on country music: [...] "Black music didn't start 'til 10 at night until 4 in the morning and I was in bed by then... If you strip my tracks, take away all the horns and guitar licks, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> a country song." [...] However, he also continued to write and produce deep soul songs for other musicians, including Z. Z. Hill and Irma Thomas. In 1971 in collaboration with co-producer and writer the legendary George Semper he released [...] "Monster Walk Pt. 1 and 2" [...] by the Rhythm 'N' Blues Classical Funk Band on Mankind Records label. Produced for Jerry Williams Productions, Inc.and in spite of modest sales the record once again demonstrated his entrepreneurial skill as an artist.|$|E
