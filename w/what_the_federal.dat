25|$|A {{national}} {{poll by the}} Angus Reid organization {{released on}} November 25, 2014 revealed that Canadians in general were also split as well on whether the attack and shooting {{was an act of}} terrorism or mental illness. 38% felt that it was the result of mental illness, while 36% felt it was terrorism, with 25% undecided. Asked about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government should do as a result, 54% felt that more initiatives should be done to prevent radicalization, while 34% favoured harsher punishments. On how to deal with homegrown terrorists, 54% felt that indefinite incarceration only motivated persons to commit crimes, while 46% felt it prevented violent crime.|$|E
25|$|Parliament may invoke {{emergency}} powers under the emergency branch of POGG. This began in 1882, when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then the supreme authority over Canadian law) ruled in Russell v. The Queen {{that the federal}} government could legislate with regard to alcohol, because even though this would probably have been considered provincial jurisdiction in ordinary circumstances, the federal government was acting to ensure order in Canada. This concept further evolved during the 1920s, when in the 1922 Board of Commerce case, it was stated that POGG could be invoked in times of war and famine, to allow Parliament to intervene in matters of provincial jurisdiction. POGG was later used this way in the Anti-Inflation Reference of 1976, when the Supreme Court of Canada allowed Parliament to regulate inflation {{on the grounds that it}} posed a considerable economic problem for Canada. In that case, a great degree of deference was exercised in accepting <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government deemed to be an emergency.|$|E
500|$|Several {{milestones}} {{have occurred}} during the station's 75 years of history. [...] WINC was the station on which country music singer Patsy Cline made her debut in 1948, when Cline asked {{the leader of a}} [...] "hillbilly band" [...] for a chance to perform with them on air. [...] In the late 1950s, the station's chief engineer, Philip Whitney, designed a CONELRAD alarm device for FM stations to warn listeners {{in the event of an}} enemy attack during the Cold War. [...] Whitney also created many of the remote control systems used by radio stations. [...] He was awarded for his work by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1970. [...] WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour—in excess of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Communications Commission (FCC) permitted. The station encountered further trouble in 1988 when a local prosecutor called one of its promotions an [...] "illegal cash lottery"; a judge disagreed. [...] In that same year, the news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for [...] "Best Radio Spot News".|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of Mosby and his Rangers was a conspicuous sight to the locals, who knew {{all too well}} <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> might do to them if they were found aiding and abetting the Rangers.

2500|$|Russell had {{admitted}} to that during his appeal, {{but he and}} his lawyers argued that the entrapment defense should focus entirely on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> operatives did and not his state of mind. They asked the Court to overrule two previous cases that had established this [...] "subjective" [...] test in favor of the [...] "objective" [...] one they advocated. It declined to do so. But Justice William Rehnquist pondered the possibility that what has become known as [...] "outrageous government conduct" [...] might force a judicial hand in an entrapment case regardless of any specific rights that had been or not been violated. While he backed away from it in a later opinion, his words have become a rallying point for advocates of the objective entrapment standard.|$|E
2500|$|Following a {{referendum}} on March 10, 1996, Romansh was recognized as a partial official language of Switzerland alongside German, French, and Italian in article 70 of the federal constitution. According to the article, German, French, Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh are national languages of Switzerland. The official languages are declared to be German, French, and Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh is an official language for correspondence with Romansh-speaking people. This means that in principle, {{it is possible to}} address the federal administration in Romansh and receive an answer in the same language. In <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Culture Office itself admits is [...] "more a placatory and symbolic use" [...] of Romansh, the federal authorities occasionally translate some official texts into Romansh. In general, though, demand for Romansh-language services is low because, according to the Federal Culture Office, Romansh speakers may either dislike the official Rumantsch Grischun idiom or prefer to use German in the first place, as most are perfectly bilingual. Without a unified standard language, the status of an official language of the Swiss Confederation would not have been conferred to Romansh. It takes time and needs to be promoted to get implemented in this new function.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, when asked <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government’s role {{should be in}} {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E
