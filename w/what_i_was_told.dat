25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> and had no other choice.|$|E
500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|Upon his return, {{he found}} that the story {{was not going to be}} used in the current form. Gerrold later said that [...] "I was told that Gene's lawyer did not like the script and felt that this was not a good episode, and so on his advice, it seems, the script was cancelled. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> by someone who was in a {{position}} to know. I don't have any proof in writing, so I have to qualify it by saying someone told me." [...] Official sources stated that Paramount became involved, and that the company felt the story was inappropriate for younger viewers in the syndicated marketplace and that complaints would be received from parents. The script was given to Herbert Wright to re-write. Roddenberry gave Wright a number notes on the script, who accidentally handed over notes on the script to Gerrold which were written by Roddenberry's lawyer, Leonard Maizlish. Due to the workload on Wright at the time, Gerrold offered to make a first attempt at the re-write with the intention of removing the homosexual characters. However, after initially clearing that with Roddenberry, Wright later received a phone call from him telling Wright not to let Gerrold work on it. Shortly after, Wright received a second call from Maizlish to reinforce the message that Gerrold must not be allowed to work on the script.|$|E

You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad.

One of the {{officers}} commented on the blood, but no attempt was made to examine Alder. PS Dunn was heard on the CCTV footage saying that Alder should be taken to the hospital, to which Dawson and Blakey reply that they had just come from there and that they believe Alder is feigning unconsciousness. Dawson said: [...] "This is acting now" [...] and [...] "This is just an acting thing," [...] while Blakey said: [...] "He's right as rain...

2500|$|UK band, Deep Purple {{went home}} with $60,000 (2013:$382,202), while most local groups went home empty handed. AC/DC {{allegedly}} refused to play after Deep Purple roadies provoked a fistfight with them. According to Deep Purple's lead vocalist, David Coverdale, [...] "Apparently, a young Aussie band had jumped onstage, plugged into our gear and started playing! Well, all hell broke loose, from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told.</b> Our roadies (big buggers to a man) wrestled with the young band {{to get them off}} our equipment and off the stage. Chaos and frolics ensued". Jim Keays performed his solo concept album The Boy from the Stars. Keays and his band were reportedly the only act to have been paid for their appearance, having arranged an outside sponsorship. Later in the year, Deep Purple planned a tour for 1976 and after the Australian Musicians Union [...] "made it clear ... that the proposed tour of Deep Purple could lead to considerable unrest" [...] the UK band placed money into a fund so that artists appearing at Sunbury '75 were paid the full musician's rate.|$|E

2500|$|Fattouma Khefacha, {{was born}} in 1861 to Khadouja Mzali and Ahmed Khefacha. When she was very young, her parents divorced. Bourguiba, who had always criticized {{repudiation}} in Islam, stated in 1973, that the reason of the divorce was [...] "futile". Indeed, the divorce took place because Khadouja presented a cold meal to her husband. Once separated, Ahmed married another woman and founded a new family. Khadouja then, {{had no choice but}} to get back to her parent's place, in the [...] "Tripolitanian quarter". It was in that house that Fattouma was raised, her mother refusing to remarry. In 1880, at the age of 15 or 16 years old, Fattouma married Ali Bourguiba, and upon the instance of her mother, wedded in her father's house, before parting for that of her groom. Khadouja, whose father died in 1884, moved into her daughter's house where they cohabited. Therefore, she helped with house chores, participating in supplies preparations and wool washing, at the seaside. She had a good relationship with her sister, Aïchoucha Mzali, mother of the famous Abelaziz al-Aroui, who lived at the end of the same street. Despite that, Bourguiba stated that [...] "in reality, there wasn't much of a relationship between my family and that of mother, that it to say, that of Ahmed Khefacha, who, as I said, had remarried. However, one day, when going across a nearby square, known today as independence square, where there had been a grand café, my father, who held my hand, told me to go kiss my grandfather, while designating a ruddy faced old man. So I did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> and kissed him".|$|E

The vessel never pleased me, and yet I can now look back, and {{acknowledge}} that both her master and her mate were respectable, considerate men, who had my own good in view more than I had myself. There was an American ship, called the Plato, in port, and I had half a mind to try my luck in her. The master of this vessel was said to be a tartar, however, and a set of us had doubts about the expediency of trusting ourselves with such a commander. When we came to sound around him, we discovered he would {{have nothing to do with}} us, as he intended to get a crew of regular Dutchmen.

I had this cudgel in my hand, and the Squire his riding whip. A ladder was put up against the window, and then someone came up, lifted the sash up high and got in.
