5000|$|Tissue valves tend to <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> faster with {{increased}} flow demands - such {{as with a}} more active (typically younger) person. Tissue valves are increasing lasting longer - now typically approximately 20 years, but they might <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> faster in younger people.When a tissue valve <b>wears</b> <b>out</b> and needs replacement, the person must undergo another valve replacement surgery. For this reason, younger patients are often receive mechanical valves to prevent the increased risk (and inconvenience) of another valve replacement.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} two time-shifted density models for <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> failure {{period of a}} single unit system. The study, {{considered}} the time-shifted Gamma and Normal distributions. <b>Wear</b> <b>out</b> failures occur {{as a result of}} deterioration processes or mechanical wear and its probability of occurrence increases with time. A failure rate as a function of time deceases in an early failure period and it increases in <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> period. Failure rates for time shifted distributions and expression for mean time to system are also obtained. Finally, the graphically representation of all the measures of reliability are shown. So we can say from the study that in the <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> period the reliability of the system increases and failure rates of the system decreases...|$|R
5|$|The {{high volume}} of {{visitors}} ascending the Borobudur's narrow stairs, {{has caused a}} severe wear out on the stone of the stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent are severely <b>worn</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, Braithwaite, a popular commander, was {{temporarily}} in charge of the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for his refusal to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, UB-10 {{had been}} {{converted}} into a minelayer by the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. UB-10 was seriously damaged in a British air raid on Flanders in July 1918, and was decommissioned in September 1918 in a <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> condition. She was not deemed seaworthy to sail to Germany when the bases in Flanders were being evacuated by the Germans in October 1918 and was scuttled off Zeebrugge in early October.|$|E

5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} <b>worn</b> <b>out,</b> {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender {{to the idea of a}} long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for breaking up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in good enough shape that they were assigned as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E

5|$|Mammoths {{continued}} growing during adulthood, as {{do other}} elephants. Males grew until age 40, and females until age 25. Mammoths {{may have had}} gestation periods of 21–22 months, like those of modern elephants. Columbian mammoths had six sets of molars {{in the course of}} a lifetime. At 6–12 months the second set of molars would erupt, with the first set <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for ten years, and this process was repeated until the sixth set emerged at 30 years of age. When the last set of molars wore out the animal would be unable to chew, and would die of starvation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 1906, Niobe was recommissioned {{for service}} in the East Asia Squadron. She left Wilhelmshaven on 9 July and rendezvoused with the squadron, the {{flagship}} {{of which was the}} armored cruiser , on 8 September. The ship cruised Chinese and Japanese waters for the next three years; her time in the East Asia Squadron was uneventful. On 31 January 1909, Niobe steamed out of the main German port in the region, Tsingtao, and made the return voyage to Germany. She reached Kiel on 21 March, and having become badly <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> during her three years abroad, she was decommissioned ten days later.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{numerous}} {{causes of}} leaks. Leaks can occur {{from the outset}} even during construction or initial manufacture/assembly of fluid systems. Pipes, tubing, valves, fittings, or other components may be improperly joined or welded together. Components with threads may be improperly screwed together. Leaks {{can be caused by}} damage; for example, punctures or fracture. Often leaks are the result of deterioration of materials from wear or aging, such as rusting or other corrosion or decomposition of elastomers or similar polymer materials used as gaskets or other seals. For example, <b>wearing</b> <b>out</b> of faucet washers causes water to leak at the faucets. Cracks may result from either outright damage, or <b>wearing</b> <b>out</b> by stress such as fatigue failure or corrosion such as stress corrosion cracking. <b>Wearing</b> <b>out</b> of a surface between a disk and its seat in a valve could cause a leak between ports (valve inlets or outlets). <b>Wearing</b> <b>out</b> of packing around a turning valve stem or rotating centrifugal pump shaft could develop into fluid outleakage into the environment. For some frequently operating centrifugal pumps, such leakage is so expected that provisions are made for carrying away the leakage. Similarly, <b>wearing</b> <b>out</b> of seals or packing around piston-driven pumps could also develop into outleakage to the environment.|$|R

Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey the culture and feel of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and <b>worn</b> <b>out.</b> Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E
5|$|The Government may ask for {{the flag}} to be lowered to half-mast {{in the event of}} the death of an {{important}} person or for national mourning. No person is permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony. However, the national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral. No person may display any flag that is damaged or dirty. Any <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> or damaged flag should be packed into a sealed black trash bag before being disposed and not left visible in dustbins.|$|E

5|$|While both {{settings}} seem {{to suggest}} that Madonna's characters live in the barrio and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the Latinos in the street (sparsely <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen. The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides of Catholicism, which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
