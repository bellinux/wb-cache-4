Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
500|$|... "Indestructible" [...] {{was written}} by Robyn and Klas Åhlund with {{production}} done by the latter. The song was recorded at a studio named Apmamman, in Stockholm, Sweden. The strings in the song were arranged by Carl Bagge, and played by various cello and violin players. The song alongside [...] "Hang with Me" [...] {{were among the first}} songs to be recorded for the Body Talk series, and Robyn said that she saved them for a later release because [...] " [...] knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and [...] wanted them to get that chance." [...] Robyn described the song to The Macomb Daily as [...] "a love song ... about what you can do in a club". In an interview with MTV News, she elaborated on the song's theme and message, saying, [...] "I think 'Indestructible' is a song that talks about what happens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> new people and fall in love, and how that can be scary and fun at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Depp {{created his}} own image of Todd. Heavy purple and brown make-up was applied around his eyes to suggest fatigue and rage, as if [...] "he's never slept". Burton said of the {{character}} Sweeney Todd, [...] "We always saw him as a sad character, not a tragic villain or anything. He's basically a dead person <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> him; the only thing that's keeping him going is the one single minded thing which is tragic. You don't see anything else around him." [...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak of white hair became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. My brother had a white spot growing up, and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was written}} by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and {{produced}} by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into {{the line of fire}} with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> someone". She further said that she [...] "loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} focuses on what Martin {{describes}} as [...] "all the seasons of a relationship, from <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> someone {{to the break}} up and whatever happens after", including [...] "loving from a distance". This is referenced directly {{in the title of}} the album, Blonde, a double entendre that refers not only to Martin's blonde hair but also to the slang word for [...] "girlfriend" [...] in Quebec French.|$|E

2500|$|Jones tirelessly {{defended the}} {{integrity}} of country music, telling Billboard in 2006, [...] "It's never been for love of money. [...] I thank God for it because it makes me a living. [...] But I sing because I love it, {{not because of the}} dollar signs." [...] Jones also {{went out of his way}} to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. [...] "Everybody knows he's a great singer," [...] Alan Jackson stated in 1995, [...] "but what I like most about George is that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!" ...|$|E

I will have to return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame on you to bring this stigma upon the fair name of your native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them it was you who, when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence you have so shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
