5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, {{the primary reason for}} this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

50|$|Given {{that in all}} of the named genres, {{and many}} others, a chord {{progression}} is repeated to form a song or tune, composers, songwriters and arrangers have developed a number of <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> variety <b>to</b> a repeated chord progression. Of course, there are many <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> variety <b>to</b> music, including changing the dynamics (loudness and softness) or instrumentation. This article is about the use of chord substitution to create variety in a chord progression.|$|R

25|$|The building's facade {{was covered}} with {{continuous}} glass windows along with alternating azure and aquamarine porcelain spandrels. The colorful design was a popular <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> color to otherwise bland urban skylines of the mid-twentieth century. The ground floor, containing the main entrance on Ervay, was covered in granite and recessed to provide extra sidewalk width for street level retail space; the second floor was covered in mosaics. Opened in 1958 as a general office building, it was popular with insurance companies, law firms, and aviation-related companies.|$|E
25|$|These are {{equivalent}} to the Gell-Mann matrices. The critical feature of these particular eight states {{is that they are}} linearly independent, and also independent of the singlet state, hence 321 or 23. There is no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> any combination of these states to produce any other, and it is also impossible to add them to make r, g, or b the forbidden singlet state. There are many other possible choices, but all are mathematically equivalent, at least equally complicated, and give the same physical results.|$|E

25|$|At the {{culmination}} of the first drive for expansion, the IHSA also sought a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a state championship in football to its schedule of events. Because of the sheer number of schools involved, a playoff involving all schools was not possible. In 1974, the IHSA introduced a five-class system in which teams qualified based on their regular-season performance. The addition of the football playoffs coaxed the last large group of non-members, the schools of the Chicago Catholic League, to join the IHSA. The playoffs were expanded to six classes in 1980 and eight classes in 2001.|$|E
25|$|With their courier, John Griffen, {{having had}} second {{thoughts}} about passing on the instructions Cunningham had given him {{to pass on to}} Brian Furey and subsequently being arrested, the call out messages to Windsor, Parramatta and Sydney failed, and the uprising was confined to west of the Parramatta area. After fruitlessly waiting for a signal of a successful internal takeover of Parramatta, and the non-appearance of reinforcements Cunningham was forced to withdraw from Parramatta to Toongabbie to re-assess his strategy. Having already declared his hand, and deprived of both surprise and facing a superior and well disciplined force of Red Coats and enthusiastic militia, the uprising under Cunningham had no recourse but to withdraw west towards the Hawkesbury hoping to pick up more recruits and meeting his missing forces on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to his forces.|$|E

500|$|By 1969, Palm Avenue was {{the primary}} {{commercial}} street in Imperial Beach, and was described by the San Diego Union as [...] "a strip of large signs and businesses. It is not a 'downtown.'" [...] Plans were under <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> an interchange at Silver Strand State Beach for the Coronado Cays development. In September, the City of Coronado added Orange Avenue south of Third Street as a truck route leading to the base. By May 1970, the part of SR75 on the Coronado Bridge had been declared a scenic highway. President Richard Nixon and Mexican president Díaz Ordaz used Orange Avenue as a motorcade route on September 3, 1970, {{en route to the}} Hotel del Coronado.|$|E

That year, SR 125 was truncated to begin at SR 905 by the Legislature, as the latter was formed as a route from I-5 to the border. In 1988, work was under <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> lanes to SR 125 from south of Lemon Avenue to the northern terminus, {{at a cost of}} $17.2 million. The next year, some Bonita residents raised objections about the proposed extension south of La Mesa, as they were concerned about additional congestion and urbanization from the freeway going through Bonita.|$|E

Gotye commented that he wrote the song [...] "in quite a linear way", explaining that [...] "I wrote the first verse, the second verse, and I'd got {{to the end of}} the first chorus and for the first time ever I thought, 'There's no interesting <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to this guy's story'.

It was one of three series UPN ordered as mid-season replacements during the 2000-2001 television season; the others were Chains of Love and Special Unit 2.

2500|$|The {{financials}} of {{the company}} and the practice of CSR also have a positive relationship. Moreover, the performance of a company tends to influence conservatives more likely than liberals. While not seeing it from the financial performance point of view, liberals tend to hold a view that CSR adds to the business triple bottom line. For instance, when the company is performing well, they will most likely promote CSR. If the company is not performing as expected, they will rather tend to emphasize this practice because they will potentially envision it as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> value to the business. In contrast, politically conservative CEOs will tend to [...] support the practice of CSR if they hold a view that it will provide a good return to the financials {{of the company}}. In other words, this type of executives tend to not see the outcome of CSR as a value to the company if it does not provide anything in exchange.|$|E
