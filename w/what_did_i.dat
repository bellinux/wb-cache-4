500|$|Late in life, when {{he looked}} back at his years acting in Adler and Goldfaden's companies, Adler saw it as merely the [...] "childhood" [...] of his career. He {{describes}} his thoughts toward the end of this period, [...] "For three years I had wandered in the cave of the Witch in the clown's rags of Shmendrick and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> really know of my trade?... If someday I return to the Yiddish theater, let me at least not be so ignorant." ...|$|E
500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not something I could do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ferguson had emptied two 15-round {{magazines}} {{during the}} shooting. While he was reloading his third magazine, somebody yelled, [...] "Grab him!" [...] Three passengers – Michael O'Connor, Kevin Blum, and Mark McEntee – tackled Ferguson and pinned him {{to one of}} the train's seats. Several other passengers ran forward to grab his arms and legs and help hold him pinned across a three-seat row with his head towards the window and legs towards the aisle. While he was pinned, Ferguson said, [...] "Oh God, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> do? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> do? I deserve whatever I get." [...] He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him, [...] "Don't shoot me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." [...] Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for some time while they awaited relief. While those who had not tackled him, but were holding him down, inquired as to the location of the gun, they were assured that it had been kicked away and that there had only been one gunman. Most, if not all passengers still in the car were concerned that no further violence take place and that the shooter be held rather than attacked. He was held down for several minutes. Soon, Andrew Roderick, an off-duty Long Island Rail Road police officer who was picking up his wife from the train, boarded the train car and handcuffed Ferguson.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Bloody Kisses, Steele began to receive {{attention}} outside of music. He appeared as a nude centerfold of Playgirl in 1995. Steele later found out via bandmate Kenny Hickey's contacts that only 23% of the magazine subscribers were female, and after being asked by men to sign copies of the magazine, Steele somewhat regretted the decision: [...] "After I did it, I thought, 'Oh my God, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> do?'. It was more than upsetting that so many guys had it. Girls, OK, but there just seemed {{to be at least}} as many guys. Not that I'm homophobic, but it was certainly irritating."

40|$|The {{present study}} uses {{narrative}} inquiry to follow, July, a preservice teacher’s journey through her yearlong placement in an inner-city school. A qualitative analysis of four interviews, 12 written reflections, and seven transcribed group discussions revealed {{a sense of}} culture shock felt by Julie. In particular, her sense of conflict focused around self as she interacted with her mentoring teachers, her students, and coping with doubts about her own abilities and self-worth. Julie’s story suggests clear ways of avoiding similar situations {{in the future and}} improving preservice teaching generally.

2500|$|Anthony J. Falanga was {{appointed}} Ferguson's attorney on December 11, 1993. Falanga called for his client {{to receive a}} psychiatric evaluation. Under New York state law, an insanity defense would require Ferguson's lawyers to prove he suffers from a mental disease or defect and, as a result, could not tell whether his actions were right or wrong. At the time, lawyers and mental health experts said such a defense would be difficult because Ferguson appeared to have carefully planned the attacks, and because he said [...] "Oh God, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> do" [...] after he was stopped. However, media outlets and legal experts at the time speculated a defense could argue Ferguson suffered from paranoia, particularly based on Ferguson's history of irrational racism allegations and claims that whites were discriminating against him. Ferguson was placed on suicide watch in the Nassau County Jail.|$|E
2500|$|Mayhew {{learned of}} a casting call for Star Wars, which was filming in London, {{and decided to}} audition.

2500|$|Later, {{during the}} time that Linghu Tao was the leading chancellor, Linghu {{recommended}} Pei Tan to serve as Zhifang Langzhong (職方郎中), a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Libu), and be put in charge of drafting edicts. [...] Another chancellor, Pei Xiu, however, vehemently opposed, to no avail. [...] (The reason for Pei Xiu's opposition is not stated in history.) [...] The customs of the time dictated that when an official in charge of drafting edicts were to be installed, four chancellors would congratulate him and place a bench in their office to allow him to sit. [...] When Pei Tan met Pei Xiu at this ceremony, he thanked Pei Xiu. [...] Pei Xiu, however, reacted angrily, stating, [...] "This was the action of Chancellor Linghu. [...] <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I,</b> Pei Xiu, have to do with this?" [...] Pei Xiu then had his attendants bring a litter, got on the litter, and left. [...] The administrators who saw this were deeply shocked, believing that no official, ever {{since the start of the}} dynasty, had been subjected to such humiliation as Pei Tan had been.|$|E

Maggie's next romance is with character Jonathan Lavery, a relationship brought on by her hurt feelings, as well as feeling second best to Bianca's other best friend, Babe Carey (Maggie's cousin once removed). Maggie and Jonathan's romance was new territory for Hendrickson, as her character's sexual activity increased:Because I play a sexually confused character, I have not {{had to do a}} lot of sex scenes (giggles). Maggie lost her virginity to Henry in her dorm room, and it was PC, pretty chaste. Well, not with Jonathan! When we did our first big love scene, I was so surprised about how prudish and shy I became! It's like I became 16 again. I had to drop the blanket that was covering me, and in the middle of my kiss with Jeff Branson, Jonathan], I started cracking up. He was like, 'What did I do, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> do?'

2500|$|... "Books {{have the}} vital roles in man's life {{just like any}} other art forms: they cure the soul, they educate us with the {{knowledge}} and the message within the lines, they improve self-knowledge, they enhance the imagination, sharpen the creativity. It is like medicine for the soul. It helps us to relief pain, to get rid of fears, lessen our depression. The significance of the right literature for the right person is downright more effective than any other form of guidance, including religion or parenting. It is therefore paramount that the child reads for his own pleasure from an early age. And the {{way to do this is}} to show him the type of books that he would likely to enjoy, which is not necessarily the book the school or society considers as valuable. To do that, of course, his family members and those who are trusted with the child's care must consider his personality and interest. My younger son, Ben was infatuated with the wildlife and the animal world. So <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> do? I lavished him with books by Gerald Durrell and David Attenborough and Jane Goodall, and any book I could find on the animal kingdom, no expense spared. And before he knew it, he finished two books a week and soon began reading books, by own choice, like the Jungle Book and Treasure Island and the works of Mark Twain." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him.
