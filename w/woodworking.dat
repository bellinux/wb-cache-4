5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival on 8 August 1942, the new Middle East commander, Harold Alexander, visited Geoffrey Barkas's {{camouflage}} unit at Helwan to assess its ability to implement Bertram. He looked at everything intently, but seemed most interested in the <b>woodworking</b> shop.|$|E
5|$|While {{working at}} Playtime <b>Woodworking</b> {{he met a}} woman named Josephine, his future wife, who then lived {{directly}} {{across the street from the}} toy company. They were married in 1941, and bought a home in Brooklyn several years later. Josephine and George had two sons, Gregory and George, both named after their father.|$|E
5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other <b>woodworking</b> equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron {{has been}} a central {{character}} since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for <b>woodworking</b> and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch. The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|Men {{spent their}} free time doing crafts such as <b>woodworking,</b> rugmaking, {{leatherwork}} and photography. Outdoor activities included hiking and swimming. Men formed choirs and music ensembles, performing in neighboring towns when relations were good. The men earned two days of furlough for each month of service. These days could be saved to allow enough time to travel several hundred miles home {{or in some cases}} traded to other men in exchange for cash.|$|E
5|$|Ron, {{who has an}} {{extremely}} deadpan and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, <b>woodworking,</b> hunting, whisky, and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both named Tammy, {{one of whom is}} played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinctive}} timber building traditions {{found their}} confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was {{the practice of}} log building with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique {{thought to have been}} imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. The other was the stave building tradition (typically found in stave churches), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric long houses that had roof-bearing posts dug into the ground. Although there is scant archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the Oseberg ship) suggest significant mastery of <b>woodworking</b> and engineering. In the Lofoten archipelago in Northern Norway, a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the Lofotr Viking Museum.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime <b>Woodworking</b> Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Born on 24 March 1895 at Leongatha, Victoria, Mackinolty {{was the son}} of {{labourer}} James Mickleburg Mackinolty and {{his wife}} Mary. He went to public schools, obtaining his merit certificate before undertaking formal engineering and business courses in Melbourne. Commencing his working life as a coach and motor-body builder, he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 17August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World WarI. His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an air mechanic with the Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School (CFS), Point Cook. He was soon promoted from private to corporal and later, having gained a reputation for his skill with timber, raised to sergeant and given command of the school's <b>woodworking</b> team.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Gym Hall {{was erected}} in 1904 {{and is a}} {{cruciform}} clapboard building. The {{two sides of the}} entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, larger social gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and <b>woodworking.</b> In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, and it is still used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The United States Capitol is {{considered}} one of the most haunted buildings in Washington. The first apparition to be seen there was in the 1860s as the Capitol was being completed. Several spirits are said to haunt the Capitol due to tragedies associated with its construction. One such ghost is said to be that of a worker who died after a fall during the construction of the rotunda, and who now is occasionally seen floating beneath the dome carrying a tray of <b>woodworking</b> tools. Another spirit is allegedly a stonemason who died (crushed to death beneath a wall which collapsed, or murdered by a co-worker) and is seen in the Old Senate chambers or passing through a wall in the basement beneath the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the <b>woodworking</b> was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy is}} mostly based on {{agriculture}} and raising livestock, with some commerce and artisan activity. There are some dams and ditches to support irrigation, {{but they are}} in a poor condition. In 2007, there were 361 farmers, most of whom relied on irrigation to some extent, nine grain banks and one grain mill. There were 311 sedentary stock owners, 115 semi-migratory and 65 practicing large-scale migration, mostly to Mali. An estimate of herd sizes gave 10,340 goats, 8,870 cattle, 1,361 camels, 652 donkeys and a few horses and sheep. There were 63 full-time retailers and 143 people practicing trade to some extent. There were 45 full-time artisans and 65 part-time craftspeople. Activities included masonry, transport by cart, butchering, bakery and <b>woodworking.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mansion at Wappocomo {{is unique}} among the {{historic}} residences along the South Branch Potomac River, in that its formal façade faces {{toward the road}} and the western flanks of South Branch Mountain rather than toward the river. The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story Georgian-style structure, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo's construction. The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in England, and used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River. The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade <b>woodworking.</b> A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep verandas was completed in 1861. The principal passenger depot for the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad, Wappocomo Station, is located at the farm.|$|E
5|$|The {{plastic arts}} are also {{widespread}} throughout the island. In {{addition to the}} tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials {{has been used to}} create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats. Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market. The decorative and functional <b>woodworking</b> traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The player embarks {{with the}} {{expedition}} team (seven dwarves, their livestock and supplies), {{and does not}} have direct control over them. In order to construct and operate the fortress, the player has to designate specific tasks to be performed and the dwarves will go about it. They can be assigned any labors, but their work still depends on their relative skill with it, which can increase as they perform the said task. Some task categories are stone-working, <b>woodworking,</b> metalworking, farming, and crafting; there are further combat-related skills. They are categorized further, such as are leatherworking, butchery, clothesmaking, gem-related, glassmaking, and clay-related industries. Activities take place in workshops which need to be constructed; for example, stills for brewing alcohol. The metal industry has {{a very important role}} because it produces weapons and armor for the military, trap components for defense, and high-value furniture and decorations.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced <b>woodworking</b> skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the Wohnlager {{administrative}} and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named Seidel Straße after Unterscharführer Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads were lined with gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Sokołów Podlaski, and Kosów Lacki. There was a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence for the Jewish work commandos. SS-Untersturmführer Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, with two foxes, two peacocks and a roe deer (brought in 1943). Smaller rooms were built as laundry, tailors, and cobblers, and for <b>woodworking</b> and medical aid. Closest to the SS quarters were separate barracks for the Polish and Ukrainian serving, cleaning and kitchen women.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} evidence of advanced <b>woodworking</b> in ancient Egypt. <b>Woodworking</b> {{is depicted in}} many extant ancient Egyptian drawings, and {{a considerable amount of}} ancient Egyptian furniture (such as stools, chairs, tables, beds, chests) has been preserved. Tombs represent a large collection of these artefacts and the inner coffins found in the tombs were also made of wood. The metal used by the Egyptians for <b>woodworking</b> tools was originally copper and eventually, after 2000 BC bronze as ironworking was unknown until much later.|$|E

25|$|The pulp-and-paper, {{timber and}} <b>woodworking</b> {{industries}} (JSC Svetogorsk, {{pulp and paper}} mill in Svetogorsk, Vyborgsky Pulp and Paper Mill in Vyborg, Priozersky Furniture and <b>Woodworking</b> Industrial Complex and Priozersky <b>Woodworking</b> Factory in Priozersk, {{as well as other}} smaller enterprises all over the isthmus) are well developed in Vyborgsky and Priozersky Districts. The pulp and paper industry, however, affects the environment adversely. The predecessor of the Priozersk facilities, Priozersky Pulp and Paper Mill, a major polluter of Lake Ladoga constructed in 1931, was closed down in 1986. Northern and western parts of the isthmus are also an important reserve of granite (quarries in Kuznechnoye, {{as well as a number}} of others along the Vyborg-Hiitola railroad).|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} of many <b>woodworking</b> adzes and other artefacts from Chilika Lake shows that Golabai was a boat-building center.|$|E

25|$|<b>Woodworking</b> is the {{activity}} or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (Cabinetry and Furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning.|$|E
25|$|The Zafimaniry are {{celebrated for}} their <b>woodworking</b> skills. Their homes are built entirely of wood without using nails. Houses {{and all other}} wooden {{household}} items including furniture, tombs and tools are decorated with symbolic geometric patterns that blend Arab and Austronesian influences. Unlike most other ethnic groups in Madagascar, the Zafimaniry place a much greater importance on building houses, rather than tombs, that are durable and well decorated. Fire is applied to harden wood used for the fabrication of blowpipes and arrows. The woodworkers use over 20 types of trees, each with their own specific properties and uses. Their <b>woodworking</b> style was formerly widespread across Madagascar but has largely died out and is now largely preserved only among this ethnic group. In 2008, Zafimaniry <b>woodworking</b> was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.|$|E
25|$|Nakashima's {{signature}} <b>woodworking</b> {{design was}} his large-scale tables made of large wood slabs with smooth tops but unfinished natural edges, consisting of multiple slabs connected with butterfly joints.|$|E
25|$|<b>Woodworking</b> was {{essential}} to the Romans. It provided, sometimes the only, material for buildings, transportation, tools, and household items. Wood also provided pipes, dye, waterproofing materials, and energy for heat.Although most examples of Roman <b>woodworking</b> have been lost, the literary record preserved much of the contemporary knowledge. Vitruvius dedicates an entire chapter of his De architectura to timber, preserving many details. Pliny, while not a botanist, dedicated six books of his Natural History to trees and woody plants, providing {{a wealth of information}} on trees and their uses.|$|E
25|$|Art and Handwork is {{introduced}} with painting, drawing, knitting, and beeswax modeling. As students progress, more sophisticated painting and drawing {{is introduced}}, {{as well as}} carving, pottery, sculpture, cross-stitch, sewing, carpentry, and <b>woodworking.</b>|$|E
