[...] Mojekwu described the character as [...] "very strong-willed and bound within her faith. Her best attribute is that she's very motherly and takes people under her wing to look after them. Her worst is that she takes the world on her shoulders and {{you just want to}} tell her, 'You don't have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> , <b>you</b> can't deal with it alone'. Mercy takes too much on." [...] The character often wears a yellow jacket and has a red hair weave, which Mojekwu said, [...] "didn't look too great".|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{worry about}} her," [...] advised Dorothy. [...] "She didn't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> and her {{condition}} is {{no worse than}} the condition she imposed on poor Woot.

Well, here I am at any rate and in a moment more I should have begun to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> This will do very well"--she was good-natured about the place and even presently added that it was charming. Then with a rosier glow she made again her great point: [...] "I'm free, I'm free!" [...] Maisie made on her side her own: she carried back her gaze to Mrs. Wix, whom amazement continued to hold; she drew afresh her old friend's attention to the superior way she didn't take that up.
