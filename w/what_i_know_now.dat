At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson {{announced}} {{his intention to}} stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he returned to retirement {{before the start of}} the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players. In an August, 2011 interview Johnson said that in retrospect, he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, [...] "If I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I wouldn't have retired." [...] Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he [...] "didn't want to hurt the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Astonishing Stories is not {{remembered as}} {{being among the}} best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have {{described}} it as a [...] "training ground" [...] for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. [...] However, Nicholls adds that [...] "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that [...] "there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". [...] Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. [...] He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story [...] "Quicksands of Youthwardness" [...] in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. [...] Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying [...] "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding [...] "With <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> I could have made those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there".|$|E
60|$|When I {{heard that}} astounding answer, all my {{thoughts}} were startled {{back on the}} instant to my parting with Lady Glyde. I can hardly say I reproached myself, {{but at that moment}} I think I would have given many a year's hard savings to have known four hours earlier <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} {{wait for her to}} be more explicit. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now,</b> the memory of Miss Fairlie's look and manner at the breakfast-table told me that the {{expected}} visitor at Limmeridge House was her future husband. I tried to force it back; but something rose within me at that moment stronger than my own will, and I interrupted Miss Halcombe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I wish I did not?" [...] {{she said}} helplessly. [...] "I don't know. Perhaps that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do wish. Ah, but <b>what</b> are wishes! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> that they don't matter at all." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dan Rather stated, [...] "if I {{knew then}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> — I {{would not have}} gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I {{certainly}} would not have used the documents in question." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 20, CBS {{retracted}} the story. Rather stated, [...] "If I {{knew then}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I {{would not have}} gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question." [...] The controversy {{has been referred to}} by some as [...] "Memogate" [...] and [...] "Rathergate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next, Henslow {{called upon}} Admiral Robert FitzRoy, {{who had been}} Darwin's captain and {{companion}} on the voyage of the Beagle twenty-five years earlier. FitzRoy denounced Darwin's book and, [...] "lifting an immense Bible first {{with both hands and}} afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man". He was believed to have said: [...] "I believe that this is the Truth, and had I known then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I would not have taken him [...] aboard the Beagle." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was called}} upon to make a perfect {{decision}} in a rapidly unfolding combat environment. I had {{to make that decision}} with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>know,</b> with the acuity of 20/20 hindsight, was imperfect information..." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to do right," [...] was Captain Blossom's answer. [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>know</b> <b>now</b> is, What {{do you intend to}} do with that money? It seems to me I should be paid {{something}} for keeping you on board." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{a sophomore}} at Alabama in 1999–2000, the 21-year-old Cotton was the team's most veteran player. [...] With four {{freshman}} starters, the Crimson Tide were among the youngest teams in Division I. Although the team struggled, Cotton averaged a team-leading 15.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, and he earned second-team all-conference honors in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Playing out of position as an undersized power forward, he did not help to address critics of his perimeter skills. Forgoing his remaining {{two years of college}} eligibility, he hired an agent and declared early for the NBA. In 2010, he expressed disappointment in his college experience. [...] "If I had known <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I would probably have skipped college,” said Cotton.|$|E
2500|$|Goldstone {{wrote that}} [...] "If I had known then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> the Goldstone Report {{would have been}} a {{different}} document." [...] He said that the lack of Israeli cooperation had meant that no Israeli officers were interviewed during the writing of the report. In hindsight, incidents that had been interpreted as the deliberate targeting of civilians may have had other explanations, such as poor intelligence information. Goldstone also praised Israel for investigating claims of war crimes while faulting Hamas for its failure to launch any investigations of its own forces. Goldstone commended Israel for responding to his report by revising military procedures e.g. to discontinue the use of white phosphorus (including as a smokescreen) in or near civilian areas.|$|E
2500|$|Castro, on {{the other}} hand, was {{convinced}} that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared {{to call for a}} pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. However, in a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his earlier stance on first use: [...] "After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> it wasn't worth it at all." [...] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft: the orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and the two sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organize for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.|$|E

"It's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like; but you haven't told me yet <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>know.</b> <b>Now,</b> unless <b>I</b> {{can find}} out exactly when I may expect the papers signed, I'll feel {{compelled}} to shut off supplies. I'd rather cut my loss than go on enlarging it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to doubt it," [...] replied Mr. Brock. [...] "You have established your claim on my confidence and my sympathy. I should be insensible, indeed, if <b>I</b> could <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> of your childhood and your youth, and not feel something of Allan's kindness for Allan's friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What if I {{had found}} out one who knew your brother's secret; who knew the manner of his flight, who knew where he and the {{companion}} of his flight were gone? <b>What</b> if <b>I</b> had made him utter all his knowledge, word by word, before his enemy, concealed to hear it? <b>What</b> if <b>I</b> had sat by at the time, looking into this enemy's face, and seeing it change till it was scarcely human? <b>What</b> if <b>I</b> had seen him rush away, mad, in pursuit? <b>What</b> if <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>now,</b> {{that he was on}} his road, more fiend than man, and must, in so many hours, come up with him?' ...|$|R
2500|$|While many of {{her books}} were best sellers, critics were most appreciative of her murder mysteries. Rinehart, in The Circular Staircase (1908), is {{credited}} with inventing the [...] "Had-I-But-Known" [...] school of mystery writing. In The Circular Staircase [...] "a middle-aged spinster is persuaded by her niece and nephew to rent a country house for the summer. The gentle, peace-loving trio is plunged {{into a series of}} crimes solved {{with the help of the}} aunt." [...] The Had-I-But-Known mystery novel is one where the principal character (frequently female) does things in connection with a crime that have the effect of prolonging the action of the novel. Ogden Nash parodied the school in his poem Don't Guess Let Me Tell You: [...] "Sometimes the Had I But Known then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> I could have saved at least three lives by revealing to the Inspector the conversation I heard through that fortuitous hole in the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the documents was challenged within hours on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on alleged anachronisms in the documents' typography. [...] Content soon spread to the mass media. Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by USA Today and CBS raised questions about their validity {{and led to a}} public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, [...] "if I knew then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question," [...] and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, [...] "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Partly, but not altogether," [...] replied Hare, slowly. [...] "I didn't {{know before}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now.</b> My flesh sickened {{at the thought}} of killing a man, even to save my own life; and to kill--your son--" ...|$|E
30|$|Relative to our “happiness” {{how many}} times we {{sincerely}} say “I would have absolutely preferred do not <b>know</b> that! <b>I</b> suffer a lot and cannot do anything at all!”. Or even, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> obliges me to decisions that waste my life and I wouldn’t like to take. I would prefer to live in ignorance or deception.|$|R
60|$|In {{all these}} matters, looking back upon <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was taught, {{comparing}} it with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>know,</b> and comparing my mind with {{the minds of}} more fortunate individuals, I cannot resist the persuasion that I was very badly done indeed in this section. And it is small consolation to me to note that most people's minds seem to be no better done than mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{carry you}} off {{together}} with him?" [...] he asked. [...] "I swear to God I had not premeditated that. Indeed, {{it was done}} because not premeditated, for had I considered it, I do think I should have been proof against any such temptation. It assailed me suddenly when I beheld you there with Lionel, and I succumbed to it. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am punished enough, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{divide it}} into two parts," [...] remarked the priest. [...] "First there is what {{everybody}} knows; {{and then there}} is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>Now,</b> what everybody knows is short and plain enough. It is also entirely wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was condescension, nevertheless," [...] said Eustacia vehemently. [...] "And if I {{had known}} then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> that I should {{be living in}} this wild heath a month after my marriage, I--I should have thought twice before agreeing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Blair Milford {{laughed and}} put his slim white hand on Ted's curly head. [...] "It isn't much trouble to train an artist. It is a privilege.

6000|$|... "Pleased!"

I honour loyalty and detest rebellion {{as much as any}} man in the troop, but if <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> would never have joined you." ...|$|R
5000|$|During his 47-year {{tenure at}} UCLA, Suber chaired the Critical Studies {{program and the}} UCLA Film and Television Archive, was {{associate}} dean of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, and received the Distinguished Teaching Award.

[...] "If I’d only <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about copyright <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> would have sued her ass, but I didn't," [...] Suber said in a 2011 interview about Kael appropriating his research for her essay.|$|R
6000|$|He bunched up a {{big white}} {{handkerchief}} and mopped it over his head. 'That's done,' he said, 'and we won't go back. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>know</b> <b>now</b> is {{what are you going}} to do? Where are you sleeping? What are you going to think about?

60|$|Just {{think of}} it! And I had missed it! With {{a voice like}} mine. If I had known <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I would have come out to that land and sung to it all night.

60|$|It {{struck me}} as an odd {{coincidence}} that I should see the man again in London, so soon after I had met with him in Yorkshire. This was all I thought about it, at the time.
