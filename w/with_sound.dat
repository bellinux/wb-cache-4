Sound Transit plans to eventually replace its entire Snohomish County fleet with double-deckers in the near-term future, beginning with 32 additional buses in 2018.

Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E
5|$|Following the impressive-enough {{sales of}} their first Star Wars game of , Parker Brothers went on to {{continue}} developing Star Wars titles, {{one of which is}} Star Wars: Jedi Arena, programmed by Rex Bradford. Although the game's reception was mixed at the time of release, <b>with</b> <b>sound</b> effects being praised and primarily the abstract combat being criticized, its legacy is largely negative, with several modern critics referring to the game as one of the worst Star Wars games of all time.|$|E

5|$|In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council {{rejected}} a {{memorandum of agreement}} <b>with</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit that would have expedited processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials in other cities. Despite fears that Tukwila's decision would jeopardize federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) later that month. The city council approved expedited permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity at the future South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an additional cost of $5 million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but <b>with</b> <b>sound</b> body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E

5|$|Poetic diction {{treats the}} manner in which {{language}} is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction <b>with</b> <b>sound</b> and form. Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.|$|E
5|$|Skywalker Sound {{supplied}} the development team <b>with</b> <b>sound</b> directly from The Phantom Menace {{for use in}} Battle for Naboo. Because its music is fully interactive and in real-time, the game required new material to be composed and pieces from the movie to be rewritten. Factor 5 again used its own sound drivers called MusyX to handle the game's sound, as it did with Rogue Squadron (then called MOsys FX Surround). The game includes voice work from voice actors Jeff Coopwood, Roger L. Jackson, Doug Boyd and Terence McGovern.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{underwent}} a funding crisis in 2001 after the Central Link light rail project {{was found to}} be over budget and {{would not be able to}} open until 2009, three years later than planned. The light rail project was truncated to Westlake station in Downtown Seattle and to Tukwila, the sections north of downtown and south to the airport being deferred to a later date. The King County Council called for a new agreement to be negotiated <b>with</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to Northgate, and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a conventional bus network. In early 2002, Sound Transit also explored, and ultimately rejected, a proposal to build a parallel, rail-only tunnel under 5th Avenue that would cost $1 billion.|$|E

5|$|This {{period of}} {{electronic}} music championing culminated in 1971 {{with the publication}} of Kaegi's unique record release, a 7-inch record titled Von Sinuston zur elektronischen Musik ("From Sine Wave to Electronic Music"). In the 12 pages accompanying booklet, Kaegi analyses the basic constituents of electronic music like sine wave, sound synthesis, ring modulation or electronic oscillator, <b>with</b> <b>sound</b> examples provided on the disc as well as excerpts from his most recent works of the time, Kyoto, 1970, Thai Clarinet, 1970, Hydrophonie I, 1969 and Illumination Expo'70 Osaka, 1969. The latter piece was commissioned by the Swiss government to be used as background music for the Swiss pavilion at the World Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan, a project he undertook with composer and contemporary music promoter André Zumbach (born 1931), then head of music at Radio Suisse Romande.|$|E
5|$|Freda's {{ambition}} {{to make a}} horror film derived from his desire to make films in the fantastique style, feeling that only the Americans and German expressionists {{were able to make}} such films in the past. Freda approached film producer Luigi Carpentieri with the idea of the film despite not having a treatment ready. Promising them that he would have something for them by the next day, he returned with a tape of his treatment that was complete <b>with</b> <b>sound</b> effects. Carpentieri phoned Goffredo Lombardo to convince him further. Freda followed up his tape with the promise that his script could pass the censors and could be filmed in 12 days. This convinced the producer who allowed Freda to create what became I Vampiri. I Vampiri was a low-budget production with Donati and Capentieri of Athena and Lombardo's Titanus investing 32 million lire each initially into the film. The initial budget was 97 million Italian lire which increased to 142 million for its post-production and release after the films format was switched to panoramic CinemaScope.|$|E
5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>sound</b> effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E
