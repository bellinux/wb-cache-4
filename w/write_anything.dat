5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E
5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E
5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> {{on this scale}} again and would only return to this fictional {{universe}} {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E

5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to <b>write</b> <b>anything.</b> Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E

Later, Believer changed its style to thrash metal, as the band said: ”We realized that we could write thrash better than we could <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> else”.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} commercial {{failure of}} the novel has been suggested as pivotal in Herbert's later career – {{it was clear to}} him that novel-writing was not likely to prove financially rewarding, which helped focus his efforts on light journalism and set the tone for most of his later writings. He would not <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> quite the same again – The House by the River (1920), a crime novel, retains something of the simple style, but begins to introduce elements of humour not found in The Secret Battle.|$|E
500|$|Aristotle did not <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> {{that resembles}} a modern, unified {{textbook}} of biology.

In the UK, the corresponding damages suit, brought by Peter Maurice Music, was swiftly settled out of court in July 1977.|$|E

500|$|Vonnegut {{had been}} writing about his war {{experiences}} at Dresden ever since he returned from the war, but {{had never been able}} to <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> acceptable to himself or his publishers—Chapter 1 of Slaughterhouse-Five tells of his difficulties. Released in 1969, the novel rocketed Vonnegut to fame. It tells of the life of Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnegut was born in 1922 and survives the bombing of Dresden. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with many of the story's climaxes—Billy's death in 1976, his kidnapping by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore nine years earlier, and the execution of Billy's friend Edgar Derby in the ashes of Dresden for stealing a teapot—disclosed in the story's first pages. In 1970, he was also a correspondent in Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Stefani had an {{emotional}} breakdown from difficulties collaborating {{with many other}} artists and songwriters, so No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal invited her to his house. Kanal {{had been working on}} a track, which later became [...] "Crash", the sixth single from the album. However, the two were unable to <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> following that, because they had differing ideas of how the music should sound. Stefani commented that [...] "it was just frustrating and embarrassing to sit there and think we could write songs." [...] Six months later, the two returned to work and came up with the beginnings of a song while working in Kanal's bedroom. The two experimented with combining various melodies and including what Stefani referred to as [...] "this really kinda fast rappy part". This was the last song she and Kanal wrote together for the album.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Priestess {{released}} its debut album Hello Master, which spawned two minor hits: [...] "Lay Down" [...] became popular {{because it was}} included as a playable track in the best-selling video game , and [...] "Talk to Her" [...] peaked at #33 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 2006. Even though the group have admitted that they were ultimately displeased {{with the sound of}} the record, which they described as [...] "so tight and really produced", they remain proud of their Guitar Hero achievement. The band spent roughly {{two and a half years}} performing concerts on behalf of Hello Master, supporting such acts as Dinosaur Jr., the Sword, Mastodon and Megadeth.

500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> else… I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack for Monaco was {{composed}} by Grammy-nominated Austin Wintory, {{who had previously}} worked as the composer for games such as flOw and Journey. The original soundtrack and a remixed album called Gentleman's Private Collection were released on April 24, 2013. The soundtrack incorporates pianos and drums into what Christian Donlan (Eurogamer) thought was one of Wintory's best works yet. The Gentleman's Private Collection contains remixes of the original soundtrack by other notable composers, including Peter Hollens, Tina Guo who played the violin in the Journey soundtrack, and Chipzel who composed the soundtrack for Super Hexagon. When Wintory was approached by Schatz, he was excited by the request because it involved using humorous [...] "old-timey piano". [...] "When else am I {{ever going to be}} asked to <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> remotely like this?", he exclaimed. Schatz originally wanted to use licensed music thinking that the project was too small to warrant its own soundtrack, but after discussions, Wintory persuaded him that an original soundtrack was warranted. The full soundtrack and Gentleman's Private Collection were released onto Wintory's Bandcamp microsite.|$|E
500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to <b>write</b> <b>anything</b> mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. It has that live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E
