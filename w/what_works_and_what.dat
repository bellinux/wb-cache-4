500|$|The {{second season}} of the show {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics, with Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly ranking it the greatest television season of 2007-2008. In his review of the season, Robert Canning of IGN said that this season was [...] "smart, funny and thoroughly entertaining". He also praised many of the guest stars who appeared throughout the season. Regarding the main cast, Canning wrote that [...] "the regulars all seemed to up their game in this second season", particularly praising Fey's portrayal of Liz Lemon, calling her [...] "the heart of the show." [...] Canning ranked the season 8.9 out of 10. John Kubicek of BuddyTV felt that the series had [...] "learned from its mistakes and now knows <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> doesn't". He praised the main cast, and also thought that the supporting cast had been refined. Kubicek enjoyed Tracy's pairing with Kenneth, and Jenna's subplot, as he felt actress Krakowski was the weakest link from the first season. Alistair Harkness of The Scotsman described the season as [...] "hilarious and absurd", and wrote that [...] "each character's personality is to the forefront in a way {{not seen since the}} heyday of Seinfeld". Harkness said the writing was sharp and the jokes were magnificent, [...] "with plenty of quotable dialogue", but felt [...] "what's truly heartening is that it's the regular cast that carries the comedy".

500|$|Upon its release, the Xbox One {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} critics and reviewers. In its launch review, Polygon gave the Xbox One an 8/10. Its design {{was described as}} [...] "inoffensive" [...] but its larger size noted, while the console's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on-launch. The controller was praised for its battery life and [...] "premium" [...] design, but {{some members of the}} site's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs. The design of Xbox One's interface received mixed reviews: noting that it carried over Windows 8's design language, the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller's menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures, seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead. While praised for having more [...] "robust" [...] voice navigation than Xbox 360, they felt that voice navigation still had a [...] "learning curve in understanding <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> doesn't." [...] Although its user following, Smart Match, and improved voice chat features were noted, Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option on-launch to add a real name to user profiles. Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set-top boxes (drawing comparisons to the operations of TiVo DVRs), Polygon felt the Xbox One's overall multimedia experience [...] "feels like a major step forward in set-top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Kanter from Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave a {{positive}} review and {{commented on the}} performances: [...] "Over {{the course of two}} full, uninterrupted hours comes an abundance of grandiose sets and effects; a voluminous line-up of dancers; precisely engineered sound and sequence; and sharply produced, celebrity-studded video clips. [...] Unquestionably, it’s Madonna and company’s actual show — the entire spectacle of song, dance, style, and attitude — that make the Sticky & Sweet Tour an invigorating and highly memorable happening." [...] However, he felt that the performances of [...] "Borderline" [...] (1984) and [...] "Human Nature" [...] were disappointing. Ben Kaplan from Canada.com said [...] "Sticky & Sweet is a document of a woman in her fifties who actually started peaking after most people thought she was through. Madonna doesn't speak with a British accent on her new record. But even if she did, it wouldn't really have mattered: Most of the stage banter is drowned out by the crowd's roar." [...] He listed the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] (1985) as a highlight of the tour. Tony clayton-Lea from The Irish Times said [...] "Madonna has the experience to know <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> doesn’t. It is this that makes Sticky Sweet such an interesting proposition: a superbly shot movie of the 'four-act' show that blends muscle with music, depth with deftness." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said [...] "Since so much of the tour depended on overblown spectacle, Sticky & Sweet Tour is better experienced as a video instead of a CD – but even as a video this doesn’t rank among the best Madonna live albums, as there’s too much precision and not enough inspiration in the whole show." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out <b>what</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E
