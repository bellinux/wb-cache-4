40|$|Few {{publications}} address how to efficiently remove sodium {{scales in}} black liquor evaporators. The {{lack of information}} makes the cleaning inefficient and subjective. In this work, the sodium scale dissolution rate has been experimentally investigated and {{a model for the}} dissolution process has been developed. The aim was to relate the dissolution rate to wetting degree and temperature of the <b>wash</b> <b>liquid.</b> The experiments were conducted in a pilot plant evaporator of the falling film type. A saline solution consisting of sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate was evaporated on the outside of a vertical stainless steel tube. The removal of the resulting scaling layer was then studied at different temperatures and wetting degrees. An effective method for investigating the removal of sodium scales in falling film evaporators was developed and a model was constructed that successfully could predict the obtained experimental data. The washing behaviour proved to be strongly dependent on how the scales were distributed along the tube. It was confirmed that scales grow {{from the bottom of the}} tube and upwards until the layer reaches an equilibrium thickness. The dissolution rate was found to follow a 1 st order expression with regards to the concentration difference between the scaling layer surface and the bulk of the <b>wash</b> <b>liquid.</b> The model was developed in the temperature interval 45 85 °C and wetting degrees of 0. 13 kg/ms up to 0. 44 kg/ms.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a preliminary investigation on the plasma profile of cloxacillin after oral administration, a simple and rapid LC method was developed for the direct determination of this compound in human plasma. The on-line sample clean-up was carried out using a weak anion exchanger (diethylaminoethyl groups) as restricted access material (RAM). The effects of the <b>washing</b> <b>liquid</b> pH, the ionic strength and the addition of organic modifier to the <b>washing</b> <b>liquid</b> were studied in order to obtain an efficient sample clean-up and a high recovery of cloxacillin. The separation was achieved on octadecylsilica stationary phase using a mobile phase consisting in a mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 4. 0; 25 mM) and acetonitrile (72 : 28, v/v). The UV detection was performed at 215 nm. The most appropriate regression model of the response function as well as the limit of quantitation (LOQ) were first selected during the pre-validation step. These criteria were then assessed during the formal validation step. The LOQ was 50 ng/ml. The method was also validated with respect to analyte recovery, precision. trueness, accuracy and linearity.

40|$|The enzymatic {{degradation}} of cellulose polymers {{is currently a}} rate-limiting step in the bioconversion of biomass to biofuels. Cellulose polymers self assemble to form crystalline structures stabilized by a complex network of intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding. The network of interactions in crystalline cellulose (cellulose nanostructure) poses an energy barrier that limits {{enzymatic degradation}} as apparent from the activity of Cel 5 H. To improve the degradability of cellulose the intermolecular interactions must be disrupted. The interactions of the cellulose nanostructure prevent solubilization by water and most other common solvents, but some organic solvents aid degradation of cellulose suggesting they influence cellulose nanostructure. The objective of this work is to understand the influence of solvents on cellulose nanostructure {{with the goal of}} improving the degradability of cellulose nanostructure using solvents. To understand solvent interaction with cellulose, phosphoric acid was used to first solubilize cellulose (PAS cellulose) followed by adding an organic liquid or water to wash the phosphate from the system.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of silica-based restricted-access {{material}} (RAM) with anionic properties has been tested in pre-columns for on-line solid-phase extraction of acidic compounds from directly injected plasma samples prior to their determination by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC), using the column-switching technique. The outer surface of the porous RAM particles contains hydrophilic diol groups while diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) groups are bound to the internal surface which gives the sorbent the properties of a weak anion exchanger towards low-molecular-mass compounds. Due to an appropriate pore diameter (about 6 nm), macromolecules, such as proteins, are physically excluded from the pores and flushed directly out during the sample clean-up process, while small compounds {{have access to the}} inner surface and can be retained mainly by electrostatic interactions. The retention capability of this novel packing material has been tested for some hydrophilic acidic compounds such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, ascorbic acid and acetylcysteine as well as for some more hydrophobic drugs such as naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac, used as model compounds. The influence of the composition of the <b>washing</b> <b>liquid</b> on the retention of the analytes in the pre-column has been investigated. The efficiency of the sorbent to clean-up complex matrices was also tested using human plasma and urine samples.
