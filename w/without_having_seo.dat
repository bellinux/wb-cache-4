30|$|Chinese {{firms have}} a strong demand for SEOs, {{including}} rights issues. In fact, the capital raised via <b>SEOs</b> <b>has</b> been larger than that raised via initial public offerings (IPOs) for most years since 2000. To regulate SEOs, the CSRC set out some requirements that a firm must meet before it can <b>have</b> an <b>SEO.</b> For example, firms must have a return on equity (ROE) greater than 6 % and have paid cash dividends for the previous three years. Prior studies (see Chen and Yuan 2004; Yu et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2008) provide evidence that publicly traded firms in China engage in earnings management to meet the CSRC requirement for SEOs. Since investors as well as regulators are concerned about earnings management, good firms should have incentives to disclose relevant information and increase transparency when they plan to <b>have</b> <b>SEOs.</b>|$|R

30|$|As {{pointed out}} earlier, no firm {{reported}} IC weaknesses/deficiencies {{during the period}} 2006 – 2008, but there are firms that reported IC weaknesses/deficiencies during the period 2009 – 2010. In addition, we find that some firms with IC weaknesses/deficiencies also <b>had</b> <b>SEOs</b> planned for the following year, have the government as their controlling shareholder, and have mutual fund investors among the top- 10 shareholders. Hence, we used the data in the subsample period 2009 – 2010 to rerun the same Logit regressions and report the results in Table  5. As shown in the table, the multi-nominal Logit regression results are qualitatively {{the same as those}} in Table  5 except SEO*GOV becomes insignificant. The Model 2 results are also similar except that the estimate for GOV becomes insignificant. The Model 1 results are a bit weak as only the FUND estimate stays positive and significant. The estimates for SEO and Central*GOV becomes insignificant. Considered together, these results indicate that SEO, FUND, and CENTRAL*GOV can still explain the disclosure of an IC self-assessment report and attaining an auditor’s attestation even when some firms have IC weaknesses.|$|R

30|$|If {{our first}} {{hypothesis}} H 1 is correct, then the estimated coefficient for the GOV dummy should be positive and significant, {{as the government}} either has incentives or is pressed to force managers to disclose an IC self-assessment report and to attain an auditor’s attestation. The interactive term CENTRAL*GOV is included to distinguish the central government from local governments. With this interactive term, we can test H 1 b, whether central-government-controlled firms {{are more likely to}} have IC disclosure with an auditor’s attestation than local-government-controlled firms. If H 2 is correct, then the coefficients of FUND should be positive and significant, as the hypothesis says that the mutual funds prefer the firms be more transparent and may force firms to release more IC information. If H 3 a is correct, then the estimated coefficient of the dummy variable SEO should be positive and significant, as the plan to raise equity capital in the market gives incentives to voluntarily disclosure the IC self-assessment report and to have an auditor’s attestation. The interactive dummy GOV*SEO can further help us to test if the incentive for IC disclosure with an audit attestation is the same for government-controlled and private firms when firms plan to <b>have</b> <b>SEOs.</b>|$|R
