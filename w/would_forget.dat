5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E
25|$|In the Abhijñānaśākuntalam, {{written by}} Kalidasa, when the maiden Shakuntala ignored Durvasa's demands to be welcomed {{as a guest}} because she was daydreaming about her lover, Dushyanta, he cursed her that her lover <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> her. Horrified, Shakuntala's companions managed to mollify Durvasa, who {{softened}} the curse, saying that Dushyanta would remember Shakuntala {{when he saw the}} ring that he gave her as a token of their love. The sage's curse came true of course and was eventually lifted, just as he said it would be. By the end of the play, the two lovers are reconciled and are happy to be together again, along with their son, Bharata.|$|E

Once in Milan, Julia quickly discovers Proteus' love for Silvia, {{watching}} him attempt to serenade her. She contrives to become his page boy – Sebastian – until she can decide upon a course of action. Proteus sends Sebastian to Silvia with a gift of the same ring that Julia gave to him before he left Verona, but Julia learns that Silvia scorns Proteus' affections and is disgusted that he <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> about his love back home, i.e. Julia herself. Silvia deeply mourns the loss of Valentine, who Proteus has told her is rumoured dead.|$|E

25|$|The proud {{spirit of}} the {{original}} owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation {{of the few remaining}} Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are.

25|$|Georg Alexander fell in {{love with}} his mother’s lady in waiting Natalia Feodorovna Vanljarskya (16 May 1858 - 14 March 1921), the {{daughter}} of Fedor Vanliarsky, a Councilor of State, who served in the Ministry of Finance. She {{was a member of the}} Russian nobility, but not of royal blood. Vanljarskya was a skillful singer and the couple was brought together by their shared passion for music. Grand Duchess Catherine Mikahilovna opposed their union and fired Natalia, hoping that his son <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> the affair and would marry a bride of royal background. However Georg Alexander persisted and in June 1889 he went to Germany to obtain the permission to marry from the head of the family, his uncle, Grand Duke Frederick William (1819-1904). With his uncle’s consent, George Georgievich married Natalia Vanliarskya on 14 February 1890 in St. Petersburg. As their union was morganatic, she received from the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz the title of Countess von Carlow (the name Carlow came from the estate Karlivka in Poltava province, that belonged to Georg-Alexander) that would pass to their children. Their marriage was a happy one and Natalia eventually became loved by her husband’s family.|$|E
25|$|Le Vau redid the exteriors of Saint-Fargeau {{at a cost}} of 200,000 livres. They {{were lost}} in a fire in 1752 and {{suffered}} further damage in 1850, thus all evidence of the appearance of Mademoiselle's residence was lost. Despite being an exile, she still visited her father at Blois. While at Saint-Fargeau, she dabbled in writing and wrote a small biography under the title of Madame de Fouquerolles despite her bad spelling and grammar. Mademoiselle looked to her financial affairs, which had been under her father's management. Having reached her majority in 1652 it was discovered that her father had not been entirely honest with the management of her finances and that was the reason for her 800,000 livres of debt. At the same time her grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Guise, tricked Mademoiselle into signing away money to her under false pretences. Her father was involved with this, which caused her relationship with Gaston to deteriorate. In 1656, hearing that her father had been excused for his various scandals, Mademoiselle herself said she <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> the bad blood caused by his financial misdemeanours and resumed her close relationship with him.|$|E

25|$|Oak Hill Academy {{entered the}} 2001–02 {{campaign}} boasting a 42-game winning streak. The team's first tournament win came in The Les Schwab Invitational against Mater Dei High School from Santa Ana, California, with Anthony winning the tournament MVP. Oak Hill won two more big-time tournaments, including the Nike Academy National Invitational where they knocked off then-No. 1 Westchester High School 77–61 in the final, and an anticipated game against St. Vincent – St. Mary High School of Akron, Ohio, {{where he was}} matched up with high school phenom LeBron James. James scored 36 points, while Anthony scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Oak Hill to a 72–66 win. The team ended the season ranked third {{in the country at}} 32–1, with their only loss coming in a rematch against Mater Dei, which ended their unbeaten streak at 67. He averaged 21.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists during his senior year at Oak Hill and named a USA Today All-USA First Team and a Parade First-Team All-American. He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring a game-high 27 points, and the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game, where he played on the same team with two future New York Knicks teammates, Raymond Felton and Amar'e Stoudemire. In that game, he scored 19 points and won the Sprite Slam Jam dunk contest. His performances at the high school All-Star games, helped lift his reputation with HoopScoop ranking him as the nation's No. 1 high school senior in the class of 2002, ranked 2nd by College Basketball News and 3rd by All-Star Sports. Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA. He had yet to produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse. In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE's all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans in January 2012.|$|E

The working title was changed later to The Library Mob, a reference to one of the trio's regular haunts early in the show. Clarke switched back to his original preference shortly before production began, a title that was shortened to Last of the Summer Wine after the pilot show.|$|E

During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast as I did {{to get out of the}} tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Naomi sold a {{valuable}} painting to Paul {{in order to}} pay off her debts. However, the painting was given to her by Charles Tranner (David Whiteley), the married man she had an affair with, and his wife, Polly (Michelle O'Grady), soon turned up to reclaim the artwork. O'Reilly explained that as Charles was away on business, there was definite answer as to who the painting belonged to. She continued, [...] "Naomi says it was a gift, and belongs to her – but Polly argues that Charles used family money to buy it, so she is the owner." [...] Polly and Naomi later ended up in a scrag fight, which had to be broken up the police. O'Reilly enjoyed filming the fight, saying she had [...] "a great time". The police eventually confiscated the painting and Paul demanded his money back. When Naomi was unable to pay him back, Paul asked her to spend the night with him and he <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> the debt. O'Reilly said while Naomi was not amused, part of her admired Paul's tenacity.|$|E
500|$|The Weighted Companion Cube {{inspiration}} {{was from}} project lead Kim Swift with additional input from Wolpaw from reading some [...] "declassified government interrogation thing" [...] whereby [...] "isolation leads subjects {{to begin to}} attach to inanimate objects"; Swift commented, [...] "We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them {{from the beginning to}} the end. But people <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> about the box, so we added dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued to up the ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, we added the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the gameplay." [...] Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came {{as a result of the}} final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative [...] "way stronger" [...] with its [...] "death".

500|$|Minh Mạng disliked Duyệt {{because he}} was one of many {{high-ranking}} mandarins who opposed Gia Long's succession plan. Duyệt and many of his southern associates tended to be favourable to Christianity, and supported the installation of Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh's descendants. As a result, Duyệt was held in high regard by the Catholic community. Historian Mark McLeod said that [...] "As the head of a region enjoying substantial autonomy, Lê Văn Duyệt had good reason to prefer that the empire be ruled after Gia-long's death by an immature or malleable monarch." [...] According to McLeod, as Duyệt was not from a scholar-gentry background and lacked a classical Confucian education, he did not place a great emphasis on tradition and was more concerned with military needs, and that as a result, he would be more interested in maintaining strong relations with Europeans so that he could acquire weapons from them, rather than worrying about the social implications of Westernization. There was also speculation that Gia Long was worried that Cảnh's 18-year-old heir was too young and could have been manipulated, and that he <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> his Eastern roots, whereas the more mature Minh Mạng—aged 26—would not. Gia Long was {{aware of the fact that}} Catholic clergy were opposed to the installation of Minh Mạng.|$|E

2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> them in about a minute's time. In fact, he <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E

I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I <b>would</b> <b>forget</b> what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E

As the time of God's redemption (and action) was in Israel's hand, therefore, Israel should heed the words of [...] "let not your heart grow haughty so that you forget the Lord your God." [...] And that the time of Israel's redemption was in God's hand was seen in [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, My right hand will forget."
