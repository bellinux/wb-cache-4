5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} frigates contained {{more than}} 200 cannon, which were being transported to Trieste, {{a city in}} north-east Italy {{on the border of}} the Balkan States. It has been suggested by the British historian James Henderson that this action <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in Napoleon's decision to change the direction of his planned eastward expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{commercial}} success <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> {{that led to}} lawsuits regarding distribution of royalties between original creators Gygax and Arneson.

5|$|But several {{defining}} {{features of}} modern Canada {{can be traced}} back to Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's Bill of Rights remains in effect, and signalled the change in Canadian political culture that would eventually bring about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which came into force after his death. Diefenbaker was the first to appoint women and ethnic minorities to Cabinet. It was under Diefenbaker that Canada finally achieved universal adult suffrage, with the granting of the vote to Native Canadians in 1960. The removal of explicit racial discrimination from the criteria for admission to Canada under the Immigration Act of 1961 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the creation of today's multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Canada.|$|E
5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor,</b> observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E

5000|$|Climatic {{conditions}} have been thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the reduced numbers as well. Because the seeds require wet conditions to break dormancy, drought can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor.</b> The lack of moisture discourages {{the development of}} the seeds and promotes prolonged dormant stage.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Rosa was {{the only}} Pacific {{hurricane}} to make landfall during the above-average 1994 Pacific hurricane season. It killed at least 4 people in Mexico. Moisture from the hurricane <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in widespread flooding in the U.S. state of Texas that killed 22 people and caused {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in damage in October 1994. The pre-Rosa tropical depression formed on October 8 before degenerating the next day. It reformed on October 10 and steadily strengthened as it approached Mexico. Ultimately peaking as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale right before landfall, Rosa was the final hurricane, nineteenth tropical storm, and second-last tropical cyclone of the 1994 Pacific hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Gill was {{appointed}} manager of Weymouth, then {{bottom of the}} Conference South. With the club already in financial difficulty, many first-team players left. Budgetary constraints meant Gill was unable to bring in replacements, and after 44 days in post, he resigned, feeling the job had become untenable. Weymouth's chairman claimed the cost of travelling from his Midlands home <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in his departure, a suggestion that Gill refuted. In mid-2010, he joined Bristol Rovers as youth team coach. He led the team to {{the third round of}} the FA Youth Cup, in which they lost narrowly to Aston Villa's youth team, before a management restructure at the club resulted in his departure.|$|E
5|$|In March, Jinnah, {{despite his}} declining health, made his only post-independence visit to East Pakistan. In a speech before a crowd {{estimated}} at 300,000, Jinnah stated (in English) that Urdu alone {{should be the}} national language, believing a single language was needed for a nation to remain united. The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan strongly opposed this policy, and later in 1971 the official language issue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the region's secession to form the country of Bangladesh.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, {{percentages}} {{ending in}} a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then [...] "five", so 99.95% is [...] "three nines five", abbreviated 3N5. This is casually referred to as [...] "three and a half nines", but this <b>is</b> incorrect: <b>a</b> 5 <b>is</b> only <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of 2, while <b>a</b> 9 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of 10, so <b>a</b> 5 <b>is</b> 0.3 nines (per below formula: [...] ): 99.95% availability is 3.3 nines, not 3.5 nines. More simply, going from 99.9% availability to 99.95% availability <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of 2 (0.1% to 0.05% unavailability), but going from 99.95% to 99.99% availability <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of 5 (0.05% to 0.01% unavailability), over twice as much.|$|R

5|$|Mike England was {{convinced}} that choosing Ninian Park as the venue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in Wales failing to secure the win they needed, given the team's record when playing at Wrexham, and has criticised the FAW for making the choice. Wales played two more home games that season against teams that had qualified for the World Cup by finishing top of their qualifying groups. On 16 October, Hungary came to Ninian Park and won 3–0, while on 21 April 1986, Wales's final home game that season saw them gain a 0–0 draw against Uruguay at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham.|$|E
5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} expert Dr. William M. Gray on April7 predicted eleven named storms, {{with eight}} reaching hurricane strength {{and three of}} the eight reaching Category3 strength. The prediction issued on June7 was similar, increasing the named storms to twelve, eight hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. On May10, NOAA issued a season outlook, which gave the indication of an above-average season. According to NOAA, the global scale atmospheric circulation pattern which was taking place was conducive to an above-average hurricane season. However, La Niña was present it the Eastern Pacific, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the activity in the season. NOAA issued a 75% chance of above average activity.|$|E
5|$|Okinawa was {{declared}} secure by Allied forces on 21 June 1945, after an intense and costly battle. Japan surrendered in August 1945, after being bombed twice with atomic weapons.

5|$|The action {{came over}} {{eight months after}} the British had {{achieved}} a decisive victory over the French at the Battle of Lissa and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 {{was the result of the}} British interception of a French military convoy traveling from Corfu to Trieste with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in Napoleon's decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{signing of}} former Phillies closer Billy Wagner by the Mets between the 2005 and 2006 seasons <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the {{intensification}} of the rivalry. Pat Burrell and Wagner became embroiled in heated media discussions after Wagner departed the Phillies. For {{the first time in}} 2006, both franchises fielded contenders until deep into the season. The Mets steadily led the NL East (finally supplanting the decade-long division champions, the Atlanta Braves), while the Phillies maintained pace as a wild card contender until {{the very end of the}} season. The Mets won the head-to-head season matchup, beating the Phillies 11 out of 18 times. The Mets won the division, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Operation Barras <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the {{decision}} to form the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), a permanent unit whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations. The SFSG was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion—originally 1 PARA, which was the first battalion to serve in the role—with supporting elements from the Royal Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment. The SFSG went on to support special forces operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|E
50|$|LIS1 {{is thought}} to have several {{important}} roles {{in the creation of the}} cortex. Since LIS1 is similar to the nuclear distribution protein F (nudF), they are thought to work similarly. The nud family is known to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in nuclear translocation, or moving the nuclei of daughter cells after cell division has occurred. By relation, it is thought that LIS1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in neuronal migration. LIS1 is also considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in controlling dynein, a motor protein that affects intercellular movement such as protein sorting and the process of cell division.|$|R

5|$|After being {{admitted}} to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following {{in much of the}} world <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor,</b> more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.|$|E
5|$|Although men {{and money}} had been secured, the markets {{component}} of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for basic products (particularly food), and this fear <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the Conservative government's defeat in the election of December 1923. Baldwin's successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
