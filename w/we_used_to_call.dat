500|$|MIT's {{architecture}} faculty {{was also}} {{focused on the}} Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. Pei {{was inspired by the}} innovative designs of the new International style, characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in , an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: [...] "The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education." [...] Pei was also influenced by the work of US architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1938 he drove to Spring Green, Wisconsin, to visit Wright's famous Taliesin building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.|$|E

In their joint review for Record Mirror, Richard Green and Peter Jones found the album [...] "full of musical ingenuity" [...] yet [...] "controversial", and added: [...] "There are parts that will split the pop fraternity neatly down the middle." [...] Allen Evans of the NME highlighted the album's [...] "electronic effects", McCartney's [...] "penchant for the classics" [...] and Harrison's [...] "stunning {{use of the}} sitar" [...] as diverse elements that distinguished it as a group effort, such that the four band members' [...] "individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear". Evans concluded: [...] "this is a brilliant album which underlines {{once and for all}} that the Beatles have definitely broken the bounds of what <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> pop." [...] Having found Rubber Soul [...] "almost monotonous" [...] at times, Melody Maker lauded the new release as a work that would [...] "change the direction of pop music". Peter Clayton, a jazz critic for Gramophone magazine, described it as [...] "an astonishing collection" [...] that defied easy categorisation since much of the album had no precedent in the context of pop music. Clayton concluded: [...] "if there's anything wrong with the record at all it is that such a diet of newness might give the ordinary pop-picker indigestion." ...|$|E

40|$|Preservation means access, {{and access}} {{is key to}} preservation. Access needs proper {{description}} and representation, which will be embedded in the tools used as mediating agents between users and records. XML and markup languages {{are more and more}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> represent archival description in digital environment, so it is fundamental to investigate the hierarchical nature of XML structures and the way it influences the representation of archival materials. The internal structures of archives, articulated in fonds, series and archival units, are more and more represented as trees, and this raises some concerns about the restraints related to the hierarchical model. The adoption of a specific approach in access has consequences on preservation too, since objects’ representations stand for the objects themselves, and the name <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the thing, will be the thing. Therefore, the complex nature of archives needs to be represented through different and richer strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{discussion}} {{on the possibility of}} machines to achieve comprehension, understanding and true meaning grounded in the real world is a very controversial debate within Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science. One of the biggest problems is the requirement to involve "reality" in this discussion, bringing forth a lot of unsolved questions regarding the nature of what would be such thing <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> reality. In this work, we present an attempt of escaping this problem, by re-defining the meaning process (semiosis, according to Peirce), in an entirely mathematical framework. We are calling this transposition of the Peircean theory to a purely abstract mathematical model as Mathematical Semiosis. By doing this, we aim at growing a more understandable theory for explaining what is to comprehend, to understand and to mean, in a strictly mathematical sense, avoiding complications related to the connection of signs to a real world. The main application of such a theory would be in order to develop machines with these capabilities. In such a regard, what we are calling here "Mathematical Semiosis " would be a kind of purely mathematical abstraction for what is "Semiosis " in the real world. 1...|$|R

40|$|While {{integration}} increases by networking, segregation strides ahead too. Most of us fixate {{our mind}} on special topics. Yet we are relying on our intuition too. We are sometimes {{waiting for the}} inflow of new ideas or valuable information that we hold in high esteem, although we are not entirely conscious of its origin. We may even say the most precious intuitions are rooting in deep subconscious, collective layers of the mind. Take as a simple example the emergence of orientation in paleolithic events {{and its relation to}} the dihedral symmetry of the compass. Consider also the extension of this algebraic matter into the operational structures of the mind {{on the one hand and}} into the algebra of geometry, Clifford algebra as <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it today, on the other. Culture and mind, and even the individual act of creation may be connected with transient events that are subconscious and inaccessible to cognition in principle. Other events causative for our work may be merely invisible too us, though in principle they should turn out attainable. In this case we are just ignorant of the whole creative process. Sometimes <b>we</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>use</b> unusual tools or turn into handicraft enthusiasts. Then our small institutes turn into workshops and factories.

40|$|On {{the trail}} of Caillois and Deonna, the imagery linked to crystallization, between the {{esthetics}} {{of nature and the}} Pathosformel of the eye, presents a twofold aspect: the autopoiesis of the crystal and the reverberation of its being a seer: a description moving between the artistic power of the game of art and nature, and the mythical power of the game of myth and nature. The phenomenological approach by Merleau-Ponty puts in brackets the esthetics and the mythical and shows the visible of crystallization in its relation to the invisible, to the shading-off, to the “spiritual side” of the petrified. The crystallization suspends the abitual perception. It is like a Medusa’s gaze turning things into stone, that removes things from the proteiform, changing (myth of Medusa-Perseus and myth of Proteus) perceptual gaze. On {{the trail of}} Klee and Cézanne, Merleau-Ponty let us discover another natura pictrix, another autopoietic form of figured painting: the topological visibilization <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> figuration. In the vision according to the picture, according to the visibilization means, that is the colour, the needle-shaped white of the rime, is inscribed a new perception, no more pre-structural as in Caillois (butterfly’s wings), neither expressive-energetic, ocular, as in Deonna (Medusa’s gaze), but rather cardinal, elementary, a perception of the hinges of the visible, of the visible track that revets the telegraph wire, making it visibile, that gives the ontological directions, as the cruciform lines of Saint Andrew to the Heideggerian Sein...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} are today struggling {{to develop more}} energy efficient vehicles that will meet future emissions targets of CO 2 (Carbon Dioxide). To do so {{it is essential to}} improve both efficiency of driveline and reduce resistance forces of all kind. The aerodynamic drag force is the single biggest resistance force for a passenger car to overcome at highway speeds and it is {{a significant part of the}} total resistance forces that the vehicle has to overcome in average use, city and highway driving. Since a reduction in fuel consumption directly will lead to a reduction of CO 2 the best way is to reduce the energy required for propulsion of the system. Aerodynamic drag force can be divided into two parts, pressure and friction. Pressure forces on the exterior body of a passenger car dominate the total drag force. A rule of thumb says that 80 - 90 % of the aerodynamics drag forces of a passenger car are pressure forces and the rest is friction. For a finite wing for instance we will have the opposite, about 95 % friction and 5 % pressure forces. When the pressure forces are the dominating part of the aerodynamic drag <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the body bluff, and if the friction forces are dominating we call it a streamlined body. This then, classifies a passenger car aerodynamically as a bluff body. The biggest pressure forces are associated to wake formations at the rear end of a bluff body...|$|R
