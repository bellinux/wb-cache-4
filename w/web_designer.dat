5|$|By April 2008, Ezarik {{had largely}} reduced her lifecasting {{productions}} {{to a less}} frequent basis. She had resumed pursuit of her <b>web</b> <b>designer</b> and video editor career and was living in Carnegie. Her new equipment by Nokia enabled her to lifecast and produce streaming video live without a computer connection. She continued to make weekly appearances on her own iJustine website at www.ijustine.tv. Still a Carnegie resident at the time, Ezarik planned to be vacationing in North Carolina when the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 and hoped to find an AT wireless store to upgrade while on vacation. That June, Ezarik was named by Intel and its PR firm Ogilvy & Mather to a 10-member social media strategy advisory board. In late 2008, she relocated her base of operation from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California.|$|E

All of this involves skill and training in computer graphics, graphic design, and in the latest in computer and web technology.|$|R

40|$|Current web {{application}} development requires highly qualified staff, {{dealing with an}} extensive number of architectures and technologies. When these applications incorporate semantic data, the list of skill requirements becomes even larger, leading to a high adoption barrier {{for the development of}} semantically enabled Web applications. This paper describes VPOET, a tool focused mainly on two types of users: <b>web</b> <b>designers</b> and <b>web</b> application developers. By using this tool, <b>web</b> <b>designers</b> do not need specific skills in semantic web technologies to create web templates to handle semantic data. Web application developers incorporate those templates into their {{web application}}s, by means of a simple mechanism based in HTTP messages. End-users can use these templates through a Google Gadget. As <b>web</b> <b>designers</b> {{play a key role in}} the system, an experimental evaluation has been conducted, showing that VPOET provides good usability features for a representative group of <b>web</b> <b>designers</b> in a wide range of competencies in client-side technologies, ranging from amateur HTML developers to professional <b>web</b> <b>designers...</b>|$|R

These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. <b>Web</b> <b>designers</b> use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software. Other tools <b>web</b> <b>designers</b> might use include mark up validators and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.|$|R

25|$|ASP.NET's code-behind model marks a {{departure}} from Classic ASP in that it encourages developers to build applications with separation of presentation and content in mind. In theory, this would allow a <b>Web</b> <b>designer,</b> for example, {{to focus on the}} design markup with less potential for disturbing the programming code that drives it. This is similar to the separation of the controller from the view in model–view–controller (MVC) frameworks.|$|E

Peter-Paul Koch gives the example of a physical box, whose dimensions always refer to the box itself, including potential padding, but never its content. He says that this box model is more useful for graphic designers, who create designs based on the visible width of boxes rather than the width of their content. Bernie Zimmermann says that the Internet Explorer box model is closer to the definition of cell dimensions and padding used in the HTML table model.|$|E

He wanted her to have an abortion but she didn't, and gave birth to Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). John and Jill continuously had arguments and she had {{an affair with}} Jed Sanders. Mamie found out and told John, ending the marriage. They had a bitter custody battle, but John suffered another stroke. Mamie confessed her love to John; Jill then paid her millions to leave town. John gained custody of Billy and left for New York. Later, Jill found a letter from Phillip Chancellor II which named her the sole owner of the Chancellor Estate; she evicted Katherine. Katherine found a legal loophole, allowing her to stay on the estate. Billy Abbott and Brock Reynold's teenage daughter MacKenzie Browning began a romance.
