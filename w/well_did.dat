5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine <b>well</b> <b>did</b> not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{as in the}} UK, the Hicklin test of {{obscenity}} applied, but New York {{case law}} had established that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than on children and that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, Ellen Glasgow and John Dos Passos. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his brief. His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The <b>Well</b> <b>did.</b> According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do <b>well</b> <b>did</b> not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

25|$|Liu Piguang (劉辟光), the Prince of Jinan (roughly modern Jinan, Shandong)Two other principalities {{agreed to}} join—Qi (modern central Shandong) and Jibei (modern northwestern Shandong) – but neither {{actually}} did. Liu Jianglü (劉將閭), the Prince of Qi, {{changed his mind}} at the final moment and chose to resist the rebellion forces. Liu Zhi (劉志), the Prince of Jibei, was put under house arrest by the commander of his guards and prevented from joining the rebellion. Three other princes were persuaded to join but either refused or did not actually agree to join — Liu An (劉安), the Prince of Huainan (roughly modern Lu'an, Anhui); Liu Ci (劉賜), the Prince of Lujiang (roughly modern Chaohu, Anhui); and Liu Bo (劉勃), the Prince of Hengshan (roughly part of modern Lu'an, Anhui). The princes also requested help from the southern independent kingdoms of Donghai (modern Zhejiang) and Minyue (modern Fujian), and the powerful northern Xiongnu. Donghai and Minyue sent troops {{to participate in the}} campaign, but Xiongnu, after initially promising to do so as <b>well,</b> <b>did</b> not. The seven princes, as part of their political propaganda, claimed that Chao Cuo was aiming to wipe out the principalities, and that they would be satisfied if Chao were executed.|$|E

In a short biographical essay on O'Reilly for the Barclays World of Cricket book, his contemporary, the England cricketer Ian Peebles, wrote that [...] "any scoring-stroke was greeted by a testy demand for the immediate return of the ball rather than a congratulatory word.

500|$|York Bowen {{thought it}} regrettable that Bax's orchestral works {{frequently}} call for exceptionally large forces: [...] "When the score demands such luxuries as triple or quadruple woodwind, six horns, {{three or four}} trumpets, extra percussion and perhaps organ, it is undoubtedly throwing extra difficulties {{in the way of}} performance." [...] The composer Eric Coates commented that Bax's music appealed greatly to orchestral players: [...] "whichever instrument he wrote for, {{it was as if he}} played that instrument himself, so <b>well</b> <b>did</b> he seem to write for it".|$|E
500|$|Robert King, {{an early}} proprietor, opened a brick and tile factory at the {{southern}} terminus of Main Street in 1896 with the capacity of carrying out 15,000 bricks every 10 hours. Harrisburg also saw the opening of several saw mills. The Snellbaker and Company Saw Mill and Lumber Yard opened in 1895, as <b>well</b> <b>did</b> J.B Ford Harrisburg Planing Mill the same year. The mill had the capacity of producing [...] of lumber every 10 hours. [...] The Barnes Lumber Company in Harrisburg started as a sawmill operation in 1899.

2500|$|Some historians {{challenge}} Canada's {{claim to}} North America's first oil field, arguing that Pennsylvania's famous Drake Well was the continent's first. [...] But {{there is evidence}} to support Williams, not least of which is that the Drake <b>well</b> <b>did</b> not come into production until August 28, 1859. [...] The controversial point might be that Williams found oil above bedrock while “Colonel” Edwin Drake's well located oil within a bedrock reservoir.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that opponents sometimes adjusted their playing style to counteract the organisation and passing of the Engineers. For example, in February 1872 against Westminster school a brief contemporary match report states that: [...] "The school captain took the precaution of strengthening his backs, deputizing HDS Vidal to cooperate with Rawson and Jackson and so <b>well</b> <b>did</b> these three play in concert... they succeeded in defying the... RE forwards" [...] What is most notable about this report is that it confirms that the Royal Engineers [...] "played beautifully together" [...] That the Engineers were the first side to break the trend of dribbling is shown in a contemporary account of their victory against Crystal Palace in early 1872.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Ginter had amassed one of the largest {{personal}} fortunes in the South. His enduring commitment to Richmond is evidenced in his significant investments in real estate, business, and most notably, his philanthropic activity. Even while Ginter was traveling abroad, he reportedly ordered items from Richmond to support local merchants. His will included gifts to almost every charity and public institution in the city. [...] The remainder of his wealth was left to his relatives, including his niece, Grace Arents, who continued in her uncle’s charitable footsteps. Arents adapted the Lakeside Wheel Club into a progressive farm that was known as Bloemendaal, which she later set up to become Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. She also developed St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, St. Andrew's School, built playgrounds, and funded numerous schools and medical institutions. In 1897, the Richmond Dispatch praised him as [...] "one whose public spirit and broad charity have made his name familiar and honored throughout this city, which he loved so <b>well,</b> <b>did</b> so much to build up and beautify." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tidal Wave Pool: The first patron death {{occurred}} here in 1982; another visitor {{drowned in}} this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, {{the number of}} people the lifeguards saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, [...] "The Grave Pool". It was [...] wide by [...] long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as 40inches (102cm) in height. It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not swim when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim <b>well</b> <b>did</b> not realize that the waves, as fresh water, were not as buoyant as their ocean counterparts, and they sometimes exhausted themselves doing more swimming than they were ready for, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents. Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a pool or lake. Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the [...] "High Tide Wavepool" [...] but made the pool much shallower.|$|E
