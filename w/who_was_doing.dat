5|$|For his 1896 {{attempt to}} launch the balloon, Andrée had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848–1923), an {{experienced}} Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882–83 geophysical expedition to Spitsbergen, and Nils Strindberg (1872–97), a brilliant student <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras. This was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andrée expected a sedentary voyage in a balloon basket, and strength and survival skills were far down on his list.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

25|$|In 1279, the Yuan Dynasty had {{the decisive}} {{victory over the}} Song Dynasty in the Battle of Yamen- trận Nhai Sơn, which {{marked the end of}} the Song Dynasty and the total control of Kublai Khan over China. As a result, Kublai Khan began to expose his attempt to take over the {{southern}} countries like Đại Việt or Champa. Facing the threat from northern border, in October 1282, the retired Emperor Trần Thánh Tông and the Emperor Trần Nhân Tông gathered all members of royal family, Trần clan and officials in royal court in Bình Than to discuss about the unavoidable war. Incidentally, the Emperor met Trần Khánh Dư, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> his business near the meeting place and since ordered an issue to pardon Trấn Khánh Dư's guilt and permitted him to participate in the Trần Dynasty's preparation for the war of resistance.

25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> his entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called {{to ring the}} bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted a Leap of Faith, {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell through the floor. Kane won the match when McMahon did not stand up in time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, RCR ran the 33 in {{the first}} two races of the season with Scott and his family's Whitetail Club. Scott {{finished}} fifth in his Daytona Duel to earn a spot in the Daytona 500, then finished 25th in the race after several accidents. Scott ran the next race at Phoenix, starting and finishing 32nd. Scott was involved in a controversy in the fifth race of the season at Fontana, when he spun out Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Series regular Aric Almirola, who expressed displeasure at Scott's driving and source of sponsorship after getting out of the car. Scott would finish 35th in that race. Brian then won the pole at the spring Talladega race, his first career Cup pole. Scott would not lead any laps, however, and finished 42nd after crashing out. 2000 Cup Champion Bobby Labonte, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> test driving for RCR, drove the same car at the summer Daytona race, under the Circle Sport banner. The car again had speed in qualifying, timing in 4th. Labonte would contend for the lead for much of the race but finish 26th after being swept up in the Big One. Richard Childress' younger grandson Ty Dillon drove at Atlanta and Phoenix in the fall, with sponsorship from Rheem, Realtree and Charter Communications.|$|E

It is named after its founder Maharaja Vijay Ram Raju, also known as Ananda Raju I (1671–1717), the Maharaja of Vizianagaram.The site for the fort was suggested to the Maharajas by a Muslim saint, Mahabub Valli, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> penance in that forest. The auspicious date chosen for the foundation laying ceremony corresponded, according to the Hindu calendar, to the year known as Vijaya on the tenth day of the Vijaya Dasami when the Dassara Festival is generally held in the country.

Kalomoira {{started off}} the show sitting on a diamond sequenced bench held up by her dancers. She then got down and started a dance routine with complex choreography. There was also a large purple book on stage that opened up as a heart shaped pop-up book that Kalomoira stepped out of when she sang the lyrics [...] "an open book". In time with the book opening, Kalomoira removed her pink dress revealing a pink and silver mini-dress underneath. Toward {{the middle of the}} song during the break, the cameras cut to Kalomoira <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> a provocative dance; shaking her whole body. At the end of the song, she was slightly lifted up by her dancers. The background image on stage was a skyline of buildings that moved with glowing lights. She wore clothes exclusively by JLO and managed to finish in first place out of nineteen countries, receiving 156 points.|$|E

500|$|Production of [...] "Skyfall", {{from the}} first contact with Adele to the song's release, took 18 months to complete. Vollack stated {{that the reason for}} this was [...] "fine-tuning" [...] the song, as Adele and Epworth wanted to ensure that they [...] "were getting it right". The first cut of the song was {{completed}} in October 2011, as Adele had free time after cancelling the final concerts of her Adele Live tour due to vocal problems. During an interview at their post-Academy Award for Best Original Song win in February 2013, Adele revealed that the first draft of the song was written in 10 minutes. After Adele underwent throat microsurgery for vocal problems, she recorded a demo of the track and sent it to Mendes, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> the principal photography of Skyfall.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between social comparison processes and the Big Five personality factors. In a sample of 112 patients with various forms of cancer it was found that Neuroticism was associated with a tendency to focus on the negative interpretation of social comparison information that expressed itself in identification with fellow patients <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> worse. This identification process also seemed to mediate the (negative) relationship between Neuroticism and post-treatment feelings of mastery and uncertainty. No relationship was found between Neuroticism and the tendency to contrast one’s situation against the situation of others <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> better. Unexpectedly, Extraversion was most strongly related to a tendency to contrast one’s situation against the situation of fellow patients <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> better. Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Intellect/Autonomy were unrelated to social comparison. The therapeutical implications of the findings for cancer patients are discussed.
