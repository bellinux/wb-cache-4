An analysis of {{its implications for}} the protection of plant syntaxa is carried out based on the status of threat on alliance level (national red data book of syntaxa), on the relative area of habitats within Natura 2000 sites, and on association level.

First of all, the shortage of graphic documentation for the regions of the oriental Mediterranean Sea leads to a questioning on the status of the representations of the ancient vestiges for this region of the world. The second examination is epistemological, dedicated to the authenticity of drawings, it shows that all the representations are not only partial but that they are also biased.

Some other innovative clauses of this Constitution included the institution of a provisional constitutional referendum and the protection for the first time of fundamental social rights such as the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> science and the arts.
