5|$|Churches of Christ are {{autonomous}} Christian congregations associated <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> through distinct {{beliefs and}} practices. Represented chiefly in the United States {{and one of}} several branches to develop out of the American Restoration Movement, they claim Biblical precedent for their doctrine and practice and trace their heritage {{back to the early}} Christian church as described in the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|The {{influential}} eighteenth-century Reformed theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher saw {{problems with}} all of the Reformation positions on Christ's presence in the Eucharist, and hoped that a new articulation of the doctrine would be made. He emphasized the function of the Supper of confirming Christians' union with Christ as well as the union they have <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E

50|$|It {{was later}} revealed, also, that Abdol's {{formerly}} dormant mutant powers had been activated by a procedure performed on him by Mister Sinister. Sinister spliced certain x-genes from Alex Summers into his genome, thus giving Abdol {{the ability to}} absorb cosmic energy. Since his powers were modified to become genetically similar to Havok's, this explained why their abilities symbiotically interfered <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{court ruling}} {{mandates}} that a doctor be present to oversee {{care for the}} comatose patients ("the sleepers"). To meet this requirement, Sandy moves them next door to Walnut Manor. There, he meets Dr. Waldemar, {{the director of the}} facility, and Sunnie Stone, a nurse hired to care for the sleepers. While Bentley researches a cure of the sleepers' comas, Sandy and Sunnie acquaint themselves with the other patients of Walnut Manor and ultimately fall in love <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{hybrid system}} {{combines}} (C)PV and CSP <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> or with {{other forms of}} generation such as diesel, wind and biogas. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output {{as a function of}} demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{can live}} {{for more than}} 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E

In {{the context of the}} Dreams model, this paper examines three of the essential components of this temporal protection: a real-time scheduling algorithm, management of processes which exceed their allocated processor usage, and the correct tracking of a process's real-time processor usage...|$|R
50|$|Todd {{notes that}} {{although}} some composers (John Dunstaple, Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem) used retrograde occasionally, {{they did not}} combine it with other permutations. In contradistinction, Antoine Busnois and Jacob Obrecht, used retrograde and other permutations extensively, suggesting familiarity <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> compositional techniques. Todd also notes that, by use of retrograde, inversion, and retrograde-inversion, composers of this time viewed music in a way similar to serialists of the 20th century.|$|R

5|$|Consisting of twenty-two episodes, season one follows Alex Parrish, the {{brightest}} FBI recruit in her class, who becomes an FBI field agent {{after graduating from}} the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, and later becomes a prime suspect after a terrorist attack on Grand Central Terminal. Told using dual timelines, the narrative switches between the present, where Parrish runs from captivity to prove her innocence, and the past, which shows her training at the academy with her fellow recruits as details about their lives and relationships <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> are revealed.|$|E
5|$|During Shadow of the Colossus, {{the player}} {{receives}} little {{information concerning the}} backstories of the characters and their relationships <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The game {{takes place in a}} fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E

5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close {{together and the}} 23 loaders tended to interfere <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> This negated the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
