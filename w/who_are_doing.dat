25|$|Resilience in {{children}} refers to individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> better than expected, given {{a history that}} includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, {{it is not a}} trait or something that some children simply possess. There {{is no such thing as}} an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common. Resilience is the product of a large number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children who experience some sort of risk to continue to develop competently (while other children do not).|$|E

500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, there are people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|The game's humour {{and style}} {{was shaped by}} {{hardware}} limitations; when the hardware rendered the character models in soft focus, the team noted that they resembled Plasticine models, and continued to create {{the game with a}} look and style akin to Wallace and Gromit. The game was presented with [...] "distinctive 'British' humour" [...] to distinguish from other games; lead programmer Leslie Benzies and artist Aaron Garbut often presented the team with other Nintendo 64 games, such as Super Mario 64 (1996), to identify the differences. The team ensured that each level felt distinct, while maintaining a coherent style. This diversity was achieved using the development tools, which allowed various members of the team to experiment in creating designs. Manual text writer Brian Baglow said that the game's music provided freedom to the team, as it [...] "doesn't necessarily have to fit the action on the screen". He explained that the audio was designed to fit with the [...] "cheesy, slightly twisted B-movies animation kind of feel". Baglow found that creating the music on a cartridge instead of a CD prompted the team to discover new techniques of working within the boundaries of the former, stating that [...] "people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> music for CD-based systems get very, very lazy".|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{has often}} name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles {{he did with}} rapper Proof in 1992 where they {{performed}} against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single [...] "Just Don't Give a Fuck", Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In [...] "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with Vibe saying that Eminem [...] "raps like a girl". While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song [...] "Purple Pills" [...] in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> that are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two. Following me, any white rapper is going to have to hear 'oh, you think you’re Vanilla Ice?', so I am sure he’s heard that." [...] In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song [...] "We Made You". In the 2011 single [...] "Fast Lane", Eminem raps about riding in his car while listening to [...] "Ice Ice Baby".|$|E

500|$|The medal's {{order of}} {{precedence}} was criticized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The commander of this organization, John Hamilton, explained, [...] "It {{is very important to}} properly recognize all who faithfully serve and excel, but this new medal – no matter how well intended – could quickly deteriorate into a morale issue. Medals that can only be earned in direct combat must mean more than medals awarded in the rear." [...] The Military Order of the Purple Heart joined in condemnation, stating [...] "To rank what is basically an award for meritorious service higher than any award for heroism is degrading and insulting to every American Combat Soldier, Airman, Sailor or Marine who risks his or her life and endures the daily rigors of combat in a hostile environment. The Military Order of the Purple Heart strongly urges the newly appointed Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to either reconsider the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal or develop another way to recognize the achievements of those whose indirect actions contribute greatly to the accomplishment of the mission without diminishing the sacrifice of life and limb by those who confront the enemy firsthand on the battlefield." [...] The Association of the United States Navy also expressed criticism of the medal's placement, stating [...] "While AUSN supports the medal itself, as well as the achievements and importance of the cyber warfare community, the concern lies with the ranking of the medal." [...] Doug Sterner, military medals expert and curator of the Military Times Hall of Valor, expressed confusion, saying, [...] "I understand the need to recognize the guys at the console <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> some pretty important things. But to see it ranking above the Bronze Star (with) V?" [...] Nick McDowell, a member of the Orders and Medals Society of America said that an alternative to adding a new medal could be adding a new ribbon device to an existing medal, and said that [...] "The problem is that we're adding another non-valor personal decoration into a system that is already crowded with non-valor personal decorations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite its pervasiveness, private tuition {{remains a}} {{controversial}} subject in Singapore. Students generally attend tuition classes {{to improve their}} weak academic performance. Some parents {{send their children to}} such tuition because they are worried that their child would lag behind in class because their classmates have individual tuition themselves, or because they are worried that the teacher does not completely cover the syllabus required for national examinations.

2500|$|During {{the time}} that Cotton was {{establishing}} herself as a professional artist reporters found it odd that an influential society woman would, {{as one of them}} said, challenge the successful male portraitists such as Sargent or George Burroughs Torrey.
