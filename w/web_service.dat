40|$|Abstract—It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that due to the autonomy and heterogeneity, of <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> and the <b>Web</b> itself, new approaches should be developed to describe and advertise <b>Web</b> <b>services.</b> The most notable approaches rely on the description of <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> using semantics.

BPEL 4 WS is a de facto standard description language for <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> composition. An architecture style of <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> composition system based on BPEL 4 WS is presented. Then, an architecture description language, WSC/ADL (<b>Web</b> <b>services</b> composition/architecture description language), is designed according to the architecture style. WSC/ADL consists of <b>service</b> components describing <b>Web</b> <b>services,</b> connectors describing the interaction between <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> and configures setting up the relations between instances of service components and connectors, providing the support for top-down development of <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> composition based on architecture.

40|$|Absfracf- <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> play {{an active}} role in the {{business}} integration and other fields such as bioinformatics. Current <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> technologies such as WSDL, UDDI, BPEL 4 WS and BSML are not semantic-oriented. Several proposals have been proposed to develop Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> to facilitate the discovery of relevant <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> [1][8]. In our vision, with the mature of Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> technologies, there will be a lot of public or private Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> Registries based on specific ontologies. These Registries may provide a lot of similar <b>Web</b> <b>services.</b> So bow to provide the high quality of <b>service</b> (QoS) Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> for specific domain using these Registries will be a challenge task. Different domains have different requirements of QoS, it is impractical to use classical mathematical modeling methods to evaluate the QoS of Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>services.</b> In this paper, we propose a framework called Soft Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> Agent (SSWSA) for providing high QoS Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>services</b> using soft computing methodology. And we will use fuzzy neural network with CA learning algorithm as our study case. Simulation result shows that the SSWSA could handle fuzzy and uncertain QoS metrics effectively. I...|$|R

25|$|A TLS (logout) {{truncation}} attack blocks a victim's account logout requests so {{that the}} user unknowingly remains logged into a <b>web</b> <b>service.</b> When the request to sign out is sent, the attacker injects an unencrypted TCP FIN message (no more data from sender) to close the connection.
