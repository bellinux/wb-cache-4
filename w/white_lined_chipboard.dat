50|$|<b>White</b> <b>lined</b> <b>chipboard,</b> also {{referred}} to as: WLC, GD, GT or UD, is a grade of paperboard typically made from layers of waste paper or recycled fibers. Most often it comes with two to three layers of coating {{on the top and}} one layer on the reverse side. Because of its recycled content it will be grey from the inside.The main enduse for this type of board is for packaging of frozen or chilled food, cereals, shoes, toys and others.|$|E

A solid <b>white</b> <b>line</b> with a broken <b>white</b> <b>line</b> indicates that crossing the line is allowed from the lane closer to the broken <b>line.</b> Double solid <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> are in place in all tunnels and underpasses.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 20 mm. Body fawn colored. Fore wings with double sub-basal, antemedial, and postmedial waved <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> arising from ochreous specks {{found on the}} costa. There is a submarginal crenulate <b>white</b> <b>line</b> with four black lunules found on it below apex and a black streak crossing it above inner margin. Hind wings with antemedial and medial waved <b>white</b> <b>lines.</b> Three submarginal lines found with some black specks on them.|$|R
40|$|Toe Tip Necrosis Syndrome (TTNS) is a {{debilitating}} disease affecting the lower hind limb of cattle characterized by necrotic bone, wear or rounding of the hoof and {{breakdown of the}} <b>white</b> <b>line</b> region. This breakdown {{is thought to be}} the cause of TTNS, though this is unclear. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the hypothesis that mechanical damage and loading is the cause of the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation, which could ultimately lead to TTNS. Objective 1 of this research aimed to identify if loading is associated with <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation and subsequently TTNS. Eleven diseased specimens and ten healthy specimens were loaded in a materials testing system against an acrylic plate. A camera, located underneath the hoof, imaged the apical region to identify the area of <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation. Specimens were imaged using a High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) scanner with a contrast agent to assess the volume of separation. Objective 2 investigated whether mechanical damage under a fatigue loading regime would induce <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation. Ten healthy pairs of specimens were tested (10 healthy, 10 with simulated damage) under fatigue loading for 36, 000 cycles at 1000 N. The results from Objective 1 indicated a positive association between loading and <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation in diseased hooves. However, healthy hooves showed no separation. These findings support the hypothesis that mechanical loading is involved in TTNS etiology or disease exacerbation and acceleration. Findings from Objective 2 indicate no association between cycle count and <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation. These results suggest that <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation (and subsequent TTNS) may not be due to wear or prolonged repetitive loading. These results indicate that another loading parameter or a biological event likely initiates <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separation and ultimately TTNS...|$|R

50|$|Solid <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used}} to mark an {{intersection}} that a driver must stop at before entering whilst obeying all Right of Way laws. Dashed <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used to}} mark an intersection at which a driver must Give Way. Dashed <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> are also commonly used to indicate turns in intersections and to indicate intersections where a diamond turn is possible (intersections in which two cars traveling in opposite directions turn to the same direction-of-travel as each other without coming into contact).|$|R
50|$|Using {{the express}} lanes as a lone driver without a {{transponder}} during charged periods or crossing the double <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> {{will result in}} a large fine placed upon the driver.

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The forewings are ferruginous, sprinkled with grey and the costa is suffused with dark fuscous, and marked with four irregular oblique white streaks, and two ochreous-white spots before the apex. There is a trilobate patch of ground colour {{on the middle}} of the dorsum edged with some black scales and then with a <b>white</b> <b>line.</b> Before and beyond this are curved <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> in the disc, edged beneath with black scales, appearing to indicate somewhat rounded patches, but not extended to the dorsum. There is a sinuate <b>white</b> <b>line</b> from the penultimate costal spot to the tornus and a <b>white</b> <b>line</b> along the termen, edged with some black scales. The hindwings are light grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 28 mm. Adults are dark purplish-grey, the forewings with a <b>white</b> postmedial <b>line</b> which is angled below the costa and runs {{into a large}} white apical patch.

The hindwings have two medial <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> and two indistinct fine <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> close to the margin.|$|R

40|$|The tensile {{strength}} of 576 pieces of <b>white</b> <b>line</b> horn collected over 6 mo from 14 dairy cows restricted to parity 1 or 2 was tested. None of the cows {{had ever been}} lame. Seven cows {{were randomly assigned to}} receive 20 mg/d biotin supplementation, and 7 were not supplemented. Hoof horn samples were taken from zones 2 and 3 (the more proximal and distal sites of the abaxial <b>white</b> <b>line)</b> of the medial and lateral claws of both hind feet on d 1 and on 5 further occasions over 6 mo. The samples were analyzed at 100 % water saturation. Hoof slivers were notched to ensure that {{tensile strength}} was measured specifically across the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> region. The tensile stress at failure was measured in MPa and was adjusted for the cross-sectional area of the notch site. Data were analyzed in a multilevel model, which accounted for the repeated measures within cows. All other variables were entered as fixed effects. In the final model, there was considerable variation in strength over time. Tensile strength was significantly higher in medial compared with lateral claws, and zone 2 was significantly stronger than zone 3. Where the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> was visibly damaged the tensile strength was low. Biotin supplementation did not affect the tensile strength of the <b>white</b> <b>line.</b> Results {{of this study indicate that}} damage to the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> impairs its tensile strength and that in horn with no visible abnormality the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> is weaker in the lateral hind claw than the medial and in zone 3 compared with zone 2. The biomechanical strength was lowest at zone 3 of the lateral hind claw, which is the most common site of <b>white</b> <b>line</b> disease lameness in cattle...|$|R
