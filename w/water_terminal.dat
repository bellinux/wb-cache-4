5|$|The {{community}} of Dartmouth {{lies on the}} east shore of Halifax Harbour, while Halifax is on the west shore. Halifax and Dartmouth had thrived during times of war; the harbour {{was one of the}} British Royal Navy's most important bases in North America, a centre for wartime trade, and a home to privateers who harried the British Empire's enemies during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. The completion of the Intercolonial Railway and its Deep <b>Water</b> <b>Terminal</b> in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the port area, but Halifax faced an economic downturn after the British garrison left the city in late 1905 and early 1906.|$|E
25|$|Kuantan Port, an {{all-weather}} port is a multi-cargo seaport facing South China Sea. New Deep <b>Water</b> <b>Terminal</b> (NDWT) {{is currently}} being developed adjacent to the port. Upon completion, Kuantan Port is envisaged {{to be the main}} gateway to China and the Far East.|$|E

50|$|The Great Depression {{led to the}} {{construction}} of public works like the Port-Alfred and Bagotville Town Halls. Many bay area residents turned to agriculture during this period of economic uncertainty. Credit unions were established in Grande-Baie in 1927, Port-Alfred in 1933, and Bagotville in 1936.

50|$|In 1975, {{the section}} of line eastwards to Gretna Junction was singled by British Rail {{as part of the}} West Coast Main Line {{electrification}} & re-signalling scheme, with control shared between the power box at Carlisle and the signal box at the station. However the second track was re-instated in 2008 by Network Rail to help deal with increased traffic levels (mainly train loads of imported coal from the deep <b>water</b> <b>terminal</b> at Hunterston to power stations in the East Midlands & West Yorkshire).|$|E

5000|$|As of 2014, pirate {{attacks in}} West Africa mainly occur in {{territorial}} <b>waters,</b> <b>terminals</b> and harbours {{rather than in}} the high seas. This incident pattern has hindered intervention by international naval forces. Pirates in the region operate a well-funded criminal industry, which includes established supply networks. They are often part of heavily armed and sophisticated criminal enterprises, who increasingly use motherships to launch their attacks. The local pirates' overall aim is to steal oil cargo. As such, they do not attach much importance to holding crew members and non-oil cargo and vessels for ransom. Additionally, pirates in the Gulf of Guinea are especially noted for their violent modus operandi, which frequently involves the kidnapping, torture and shooting of crewmen. The increasingly violent methods used by these groups is believed {{to be part of a}} conscious [...] "business model" [...] adopted by them, in which violence and intimidation plays a major role.|$|R
