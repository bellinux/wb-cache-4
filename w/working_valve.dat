5000|$|However, {{with the}} balloon having much too much buoyancy, it rose much faster, and, {{because there was}} no {{properly}} <b>working</b> <b>valve</b> in the improvised balloon, much higher than planned. Freudenberg couldn't sink and spent more than five hours aloft. At first the course was west-south-west. With wind velocities of about 20 km/h at the time he must have reached West Berlin after about 20 minutes. Later Freudenberg passed over the Berlin Tegel Airport where he lost or dropped some ballast. His altitude must at this point have increased to more than 2,000 meters (6,500 feet), as his course now changed to south due to different direction of higher altitude winds. The balloon was sighted over Teufelsberg hill at dawn and held for a weather balloon. Shortly before flying into East German territory again, at 7:30 in the morning Freudenberg fell into the garden of a villa in the suburb of Zehlendorf. The remains of the balloon came down about one kilometer away on the median strip of a thoroughfare. Freudenberg's body was discovered only hours later. He evidently died instantly from injuries sustained in the crash. [...] Nearly every bone in his body had been broken and virtually every internal organ had been damaged. The direct cause of the crash is not clear. West Berlin police supposed that Freudenberg climbed the net to cut the envelope in which he obviously succeded, and in the ensuing events lost his hold.|$|E
40|$|Heart valve bioprostheses {{usually do}} not need anticoagulation; however they are {{threatened}} by an increasing with time risk of degeneration. The aim of this work {{is to find a}} magnetic sensor, which could be integrated in a bioprosthesis, monitoring the prosthesis {{in such a way that}} allows to confidently forecast the failure. Several models of magnetic sensors have been tested in a hydro-dynamic setup specifically manufactured, where the heart pressure, frequency, and cardiac flow were simulated. Small pieces of amorphous soft magnetic material were stuck to the cusps of a bioprosthesis, and through a carefully designed electronic system, the movement of the cusps is detected at the same time that the image of the <b>working</b> <b>valve</b> is captured by a digital camera. The small pieces placed in the valve are under an external applied field of few Khz, and the magnetiza-tion signal of the pieces is acquired by means of two series connected coils. The movement of the pieces, at a cardiac simulated rhythm, induces a modulation in the amplitude of the signal detected in the secondary coils, with the same frequency as the valve movement. The modulated signal is analysed with a system consisting of an amplifier and a synchronous demodulator. The analysis of the electronic signal together with the image allows characterizing the signal changes when the valve begins to fail, preventing the bioprosthesis functional failure.

As the adjustment gap need only be expanded over the engine's <b>working</b> life (re-grinding <b>valves</b> into their valve seats during de-coking makes them sit lower, thus closing up the tappet gap), adjustment by removing metal was acceptable.
