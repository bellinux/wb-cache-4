500|$|On May 10, a {{teenager}} {{who went to}} the protests in front of the Queen Victoria Street Church of Scientology in London was issued a court summons after being asked to take down a sign that read [...] "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult". Posting anonymously on a forum, the teenager stated [...] "Within five minutes of arriving ... I was told {{by a member of the}} police that I was not allowed to use 'that word'". He said that the police told him he had 15 minutes to take down the sign. The teenager did not, citing a 1984 high Court ruling by Mr Justice Latey in which he described the Church of Scientology as a [...] "cult" [...] that was [...] "corrupt, sinister and dangerous". The sign was then confiscated. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, a human rights group, said that, [...] "They will be banning words like 'war' and 'tax' from placards and demonstrations next. This is just barmy". On May 23, 2008, the legal action against the boy was dropped. A Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokesman said: [...] "In consultation with the City of London Police, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> whether the sign was abusive or insulting. Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness (as opposed to criticism), neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression." [...] Anonymous also held a protest in Budapest, Hungary, in the same time and location as a program of the local Scientology church.|$|E

60|$|I {{think that}} none of us were {{surprised}} when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom. When her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows. When, however, the freedom ceases the change back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.|$|E

In a day or two, the ship sailed; and off Cape Breton we met with a heavy gale, in which the people {{suffered}} severely with snow and cold. The ship was kept off the land, with great difficulty. After all, we prisoners saved the ship, though I think it likely the injury originally came from some of us. The breechings of two of the guns had been cut, and the guns broke adrift in the height of the gale. All the crew were on deck, and the sentinel permitting it, we went up and smothered the guns with hammocks. We were now allowed to go about deck, but this lasted a short time, the whole of us being sent below, again, as soon as the gale abated.|$|E
6000|$|This {{doctrine}} {{appears to}} me irrefragable; and if logicians, though unable to dispute it, have usually exhibited a strong disposition to explain it away, this was not because they could discover any flaw in the argument itself, but because the contrary opinion seemed to rest on arguments equally indisputable. In the syllogism last referred to, for example, or {{in any of those}} which we previously constructed, is it not evident that the conclusion may, to the person to whom the syllogism is presented, be actually and bona fide a new truth? Is it not matter of daily experience that truths previously unthought of, facts which have not been, and can not be, directly observed, are arrived at by way of general reasoning? We believe that the Duke of Wellington is mortal. We do not know this by direct observation, so long as he is not yet dead. If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> how, this being the case, we know the duke to be mortal, we should probably answer, Because all men are so.

5000|$|I {{credit the}} {{supporters}} of the Treaty with being as honest as I am, but I have a sound objection to it. I think it is wrong; I have various reasons for objecting to it, but the main one is that, in my opinion, it was wrong against Ireland, and a sin against Ireland. I do not like talking here about oaths. I have heard about oaths until my soul is sick of them, but if this Treaty were forced on us by England â€” as it is being forced â€” and that paragraph 4, {{the one with the}} oath in it <b>were</b> omitted, <b>we</b> could accept it under force; but certainly, while those oaths are in it, oaths in which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to accept the King of England as head of the Irish State, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to accept the status of British citizensâ€”British subjectsâ€”that we cannot accept. As far as I see the whole fight in this country for centuries has centred round that very point. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> now <b>asked</b> not only to acknowledge the King of England's claim to be King of Ireland, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to swear allegiance and fidelity in virtue of that claim ... Ireland has been fighting England and, as I understood it, the grounds of this fight always <b>were</b> that <b>we</b> denied the right of England's King to this country.|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> {{by the new}} Government to use {{our good}} offices, jointly with those of European powers, in the {{interests}} of peace. Answer was made that the established policy and the true interests of the United States forbade them to interfere in European questions jointly with European powers. I ascertained, informally and unofficially, that the Government of North Germany was not then disposed to listen to such representations from any power, and though earnestly wishing to see the blessings of peace restored to the belligerents, with all of whom the United States are on terms of friendship, I declined on the part of this Government to take a step which could only result in injury to our true interests without advancing the object for which our intervention was invoked. Should the time come when the action of the United States can hasten the return of peace by a single hour, that action will be heartily taken. I deemed it prudent, in view of the number of persons of German and French birth living in the United States, to issue, soon after official notice of a state of war had been received from both belligerents, a proclamation defining the duties of the United States as a neutral and the obligations of persons residing within their territory to observe their laws and the laws of nations. This proclamation was followed by others, as circumstances seemed to call for them. The people, thus acquainted in advance of their duties and obligations, have assisted in preventing violations of the neutrality of the United States.|$|E

60|$|Captain Evans then {{directed}} us {{to report}} ourselves daily, which we did. But {{the press of}} business at Washington prevented our cases from being attended to; and being destitute of money, while wages were high, we determined, with Captain Evans' approbation, to make a voyage, each, in the merchant service, and to get our accounts settled on our return. Jack Mallet, Barnet and I, shipped, therefore, in another brig called the Venus, that was bound on a sealing voyage, as was thought, in {{some part of the}} world where seals were said to be plenty. We were ignorant of the work, or we might have discovered there was a deception intended, from the outfit of the vessel. She had no salt even, while she had plenty of cross-cut saws, iron dogs, chains, &c. The brig sailed, however, and stood across the Atlantic, as if in good earnest. When near the Cape de Verds, the captain called us aft, and told us he thought the season too far advanced for sealing, and that, if we would consent, he would run down to St. Domingo, and make an arrangement with some one there to cut mahogany on shares, with fustick and lignum-vitÃ¦. The secret was now out; but what could we poor salts do? The work <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to do turned out to be extremely laborious; and I suppose we had been deceived on account of the difficulty of getting men, just at that time, for such a voyage.
