5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the <b>world</b> <b>must</b> first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the <b>world</b> <b>must</b> exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

25|$|George Orwell {{believed}} that Brave New <b>World</b> <b>must</b> have been partly {{derived from the}} novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin. However, in a 1962 letter, Huxley says that he wrote Brave New World long before he had heard of We. According to We translator Natasha Randall, Orwell {{believed that}} Huxley was lying. The scientific futurism in Brave New World {{is believed to be}} cribbed from Daedalus by J. B. S. Haldane.|$|E

25|$|Hispano-Arabic literature, {{as well as}} Arabic {{influence}} on Sicily, provided a further source, in parallel with Ovid, for the early troubadours of Provence—overlooked though this sometimes is in accounts of courtly love. The Arabic poets and poetry of Muslim Spain express similarly oxymoronic views of love as both beneficial and distressing as the troubadours were to do; while the broader European contact with the Islamic <b>world</b> <b>must</b> also be taken into consideration.|$|E
25|$|The Theodicy {{tries to}} justify the {{apparent}} imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this <b>world</b> <b>must</b> exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man {{can be a good}} citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the <b>world</b> <b>must</b> not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E

25|$|Storytelling is a {{means for}} sharing and {{interpreting}} experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories. Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation. Storytelling {{can be used as}} a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or <b>World</b> <b>must</b> be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.|$|E

500|$|The gradual {{nature of}} the {{disaster}} was also more comforting, in some respects, compared {{with the nature of}} modern technological failures such as air crashes. Times reviewer made this point explicitly: [...] "This air age, when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it, can still turn with wonder to an age before yesterday when a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst the <b>world</b> <b>must</b> suffer." [...] It was, as Steven Biel comments, [...] "a quainter kind of disaster" [...] in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die.|$|E

500|$|John Kinnaird {{also paid}} {{particular}} attention to Hazlitt's [...] "celebrated" [...] sketch of Prince Hamlet in this essay. Although Hazlitt does not entirely belong to the school of pure [...] "character" [...] critics, this essay does {{tend to be more}} of a [...] "character" [...] criticism than others, asserts Kinnaird, because Hazlitt shared with his Romantic contemporaries an [...] "ambivalence toward tragedy".

Following the preview-trailer launches, Chopra promoted the film by appearing with seven men (dressed as bridegrooms) at the Radio Mirchi FM studio. The succession of marriages and funerals was illustrated at a promotional event for the film, where Chopra appeared as a Catholic bride in a wedding gown holding a bouquet.

500|$|There was one [...] "crucial {{historical}} fact" [...] Cameron {{chose to}} omit {{from the film}} – the SS Californian {{was close to the}} Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. [...] "Yes, the [...] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," [...] stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. [...] "The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set," [...] said Cameron. [...] "But I took it out.

500|$|In 2012, Anglin {{launched}} his first website, Adventure Quest 2012, which discussed conspiracy theories, most particularly the Reptilians.

[...] He later studied Buddhism, Islam and 20th-century French philosophy before aligning himself with Neo-Nazism. In 2014, he stated that although he agreed with the central tenets of Nazism, he had reservations over reintroducing all aspects of Hitler's regime. A self-proclaimed [...] "troll", Anglin stated that he was introduced to Nazism on 4chan. Later in 2012, he {{launched his}} first far-right website, Total Fascism. Feeling that Total Fascism was not appealing to a younger demographic and had articles that were too long, Anglin launched The Daily Stormer on July 4, 2013, with shorter articles and a more provocative style.

Barney lived and held her salon at 20 Rue Jacob. Stephen is wary of Valérie, and does not visit her salon until after the war, when Brockett persuades her that Mary is becoming too isolated. She finds Valérie to be an [...] "indestructible creature" [...] capable of bestowing a sense of self-respect on others, at least temporarily: [...] "everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's". With Stephen's misgivings [...] "drugged", she and Mary are drawn further into the [...] "desolate country" [...] of Paris gay life. At Alec's Bar– the worst in a series of depressing nightspots– they encounter [...] "the battered remnants of men who...despised of the <b>world,</b> <b>must</b> despise themselves beyond all hope, it seemed, of salvation".|$|E
