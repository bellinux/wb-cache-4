25|$|This unified braille {{has been}} applied to the {{languages}} of India and Africa, Arabic, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Russian, and Armenian, as well as nearly all Latin-script languages. Greek, for example, gamma is written as Latin g, {{despite the fact that it}} has the alphabetic position of c; Hebrew bet, the second letter of the alphabet and cognate with the Latin letter b, is sometimes pronounced /b/ and sometimes /v/, and is <b>written</b> <b>b</b> or v accordingly; Russian ts is written as c, which is the usual letter for /ts/ in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet; and Arabic f is written as f, despite being historically p, and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet (between historic o and q).|$|E
500|$|The {{range of}} a {{clarinet}} {{can be divided into}} three distinct registers. The lowest register, from low written E to the <b>written</b> <b>B</b> above middle C (B4), is known as the chalumeau register (named after the instrument that was the clarinet's immediate predecessor). The middle register is known as the clarion register (sometimes in the U.S. as the clarino register from the Italian) [...] and spans just over an octave (from <b>written</b> <b>B</b> above middle C (B4) to the C two octaves above middle C (C6)); it is the dominant range for most members of the clarinet family. The top or altissimo register consists of the notes above the written C two octaves above middle C (C6). All three registers have characteristically different sounds. The chalumeau register is rich and dark. The clarion register is brighter and sweet, like a trumpet (clarion) heard from afar. The altissimo register can be piercing and sometimes shrill.|$|E

50|$|The {{alphabet}} {{is perhaps}} the smallest in use, with only 12 letters of ISO basic Latin alphabet without any diacritics and ligatures. The letters are A E G I K O P R S T U V.

5000|$|The {{consonant}} written u or v in Latin {{and pronounced}} [...] in Classical Latin had probably [...] "fortified" [...] to a bilabial fricative [...] in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it {{merged with the}} consonant <b>written</b> <b>b</b> (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones).

5000|$|In {{languages}} where inflected {{forms of}} a word may have extra letters at the start, the capitalized letter may be the initial of the root form rather than the inflected form. For example, in Irish, in the placename , [...] "(the) mountain of the women" [...] (anglicized as Slievenamon), the word-form written [...] contains the genitive plural of the noun , [...] "woman", mutated after the genitive plural definite article (i.e., [...] "of the").

50|$|In {{abstract}} algebra, given a magma with {{binary operation}} ∗ (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of b by a (written a \ b) is typically {{defined as the}} solution x to the equation a ∗ x = b, if this exists and is unique. Similarly, right division of b by a (<b>written</b> <b>b</b> / a) is the solution y to the equation y ∗ a = b. Division in this sense does not require ∗ to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element).|$|E
50|$|There are two {{series of}} obstruent consonant. Both often produce a {{noticeable}} delay before {{the onset of}} the following vowel: the 'fortis' series (written p t č k kw s h hw) tends to be aspirated, with a noisy transition to the vowel, while the 'lenis' series (<b>written</b> <b>b</b> d g gw ’ z), optionally voiced, is glottalized, with a silent transition to the vowel, which in turn tends to be laryngealized. The glottal stop is faint, and noticeable primarily in the laryngealizing effect it has on adjacent vowels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remaining}} five {{notes of}} the chromatic scale (the black keys on a piano keyboard) were added gradually; the first being B, since B was flattened in certain modes to avoid the dissonant tritone interval. This change was not always shown in notation, but when <b>written,</b> <b>B</b> (B-flat) was written as a Latin, round [...] "b", and B (B-natural) a Gothic or [...] "hard-edged" [...] b. These evolved into the modern flat (...) and natural (...) symbols respectively. The sharp symbol arose from a barred b, called the [...] "cancelled b".|$|E

50|$|The {{cor anglais}} is a {{transposing}} instrument pitched in F, a perfect fifth {{lower than the}} oboe (a C instrument). This means that music for the cor anglais is written a perfect fifth higher than the instrument actually sounds. The fingering and playing technique used for the cor anglais are {{essentially the same as}} those of the oboe and oboists typically double on the cor anglais when required. The cor anglais normally lacks the lowest B key found on most oboes and so its sounding range stretches from E3 (<b>written</b> <b>B)</b> below middle C to C6 two octaves above middle C.|$|E
