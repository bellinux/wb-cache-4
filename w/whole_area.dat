The Historia Regum claims that such a division took place not in Oslac's time but Osulf's, and that the division line was the River Tyne rather than Tees; historian Dorothy Whitelock considered this to be apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Behind the sea wall, {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster. The {{construction of a new}} sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a reed bed on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.|$|E

5|$|Mackintosh's party, {{which left}} the ship {{on the morning}} of 3 January, {{consisted}} of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies and a large mailbag. Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh and one companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find next day that the <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> around them had broken up. After a desperate dash over the moving floes, they managed to reach a small glacier tongue. They camped there, and waited for several days for their snow-blindness to subside. When their vision returned, they found that Cape Royds was in sight but inaccessible, as the sea-ice leading to it had gone, leaving a stretch of open water. They {{had little choice but to}} make for the hut by land, a dangerous undertaking without appropriate equipment and experience.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Squadron (AFC) patrols {{found the}} Shunet Nimrin {{garrison}} {{still in place}} {{on the morning of}} 22 September, but Rujm el Oshir camp (to the east of Jericho, half way between the Jordan River and the Hedjaz railway) had been broken up, and fires burned west of the Amman railway station. Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, half way between the Jordan River and Amman) was found to be full of Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of traffic at Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds.|$|E

5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E
50|$|In February 1287 a storm hit the {{southern}} coast of England with such ferocity that <b>whole</b> <b>areas</b> of coastline were redrawn. Silting up and cliff collapses led to towns that had stood by the sea finding themselves landlocked, while others that had been inland found themselves {{with access to the}} sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{second phase}} of {{building}} saw the end of roads, ways and crescents, instead <b>whole</b> <b>areas</b> were named after trees; Beech Field; Oak Field; Ash Field and Elm Field.

5|$|The {{surrounding}} {{soils are}} mostly a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for arable farming {{and the growing}} of grains of all kinds {{that contributed to the}} area being a mostly farming community until the modern era. Soils were further enriched over the millennia by alluvial deposits from the River Taff. The bedrock under the <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> is predominantly sandstone, dating from both the Devonian period (Old Red Sandstone) and the Triassic (New Red Sandstone) laid down in arid conditions. These may subsequently have been ground down by the Taff valley glacier during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway.|$|E
5|$|After 1732, the King's Mews {{were divided}} into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of William Kent. Its site is {{occupied}} by the National Gallery. In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed John Nash to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent's stable block, and as far east as St Martin's Lane. His plans left open the <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy. The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin's Lane and the Strand {{and the construction of}} a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after. Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named for William IV commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830. Around 1835, it was decided that the square would be named after the Battle of Trafalgar as suggested by architect George Ledwell Taylor, commemorating Nelson's victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|It {{is notable}} for a carved roof, with lions {{and a small}} cider barrel purportedly carved by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also {{inspired}} by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside {{is one of the}} finest wooden carved roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> of the roof is divided into square carved panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with carved bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each carved with the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon-like beasts. It is said there are bullet holes in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar table are Jacobean woodwork. There are five other churches in the town, including Catholic and Methodist groups.|$|E

5|$|The Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is an {{area between}} 14–28° {{southern}} latitude where volcanic activity dates to the Eocene. Ignimbritic activity has occurred over the <b>whole</b> <b>area,</b> particularly north of 25° southern latitude where the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex is situated. Ignimbrites are primarily rhyolite and rhyodacite and subordinate shoshonite. The more southern ignimbrites are felsic and have a low crystal content. With {{the exception of the}} Luingo caldera and Cerro Galán, most volcanism south of 25° southern latitude is of low volume. After a phase of pyroclastic activity in the Antofalla area during the Eocene, a number of volcanoes formed from calc-alkaline magmas during the Miocene. Changes in subduction geometry including the removal of continental crust from the boundary 8-3 mya have caused a thickening of the crust as well as an eastward shift of the volcanic front. Huaynaputina volcano in Peru is part of the Central Volcanic Zone and had a major eruption in 1600.|$|E

As the capital, the city is vital to the political and economic welfare of the state. It is the centre for the state and federal government agencies administration buildings, housing the offices of many ministries' departments and governmental bodies, such as the Immigration and Customs Department, State Economic Planning Unit, Pos Malaysia Kuala Terengganu General Post Office, Terengganu State Library, and many others. As the administrative capital of Terengganu, the Legislative Assembly convenes at Wisma Darul Iman, the state secretariat building. Kuala Terengganu is also the royal capital of the state, being the site of the Sultan's many palaces, for example Istana Badariah and Istana Maziah.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 renumbering, Route 8 was renumbered to Route 94, {{which was}} {{extended}} northeast past Newton along former Route 31 to the New York state line, matching NY 94 across the border. It was initially only marked south of Hamburg, as {{none of the}} route north of Hamburg was state-maintained. Originally, Route 94 began at the now razed Delaware Bridge, where US 46 would cross into Pennsylvania. Route 94 would wind right and north-east a few to Columbia, where it joined its current route. In December 1953, both the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge and Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge opened. That year a section of Old Mine Road was rebuilt and aligned as a four lane freeway between Columbia and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. Following this, US 46 was rerouted over the first several miles of Route 94 between the Delaware Bridge and Columbia, and Route 94 was cut back to Columbia, near the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Here, US 46 would end and US 611, would cross the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge from Pennsylvania and follow the freeway north to the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. The freeway portion that US 611 followed {{became a part of}} I-80 in 1959. When US 611 was removed from New Jersey by 1969, Route 94 was extended to the state line on the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Also by this time, the unsigned portions of Route 94 north of Newton were signed. In 1973, this <b>whole</b> <b>area</b> was realigned into a complex interchange as the New Jersey portion of Interstate 80 was completed.|$|E
