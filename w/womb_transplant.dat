The show intended to educate audiences about issues facing sex workers and refute stereotypes contributing to violence against them. Yapping Out Loud also incorporated Ross' animal-rights activism with images of coyotes and comparisons between oppression faced by sex workers and coyotes, inspired by the American sex-worker organization Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics. In 2001 and 2002 she performed a nine-month Pregnancy Project, appearing in public with a prosthetic belly to have conversations about gender, motherhood {{and the possibility of}} <b>womb</b> <b>transplants</b> for transsexuals.|$|R

Lili died after the last operation when the <b>transplanted</b> <b>womb</b> was rejected by her body.|$|R

50|$|In 2012, the world's first <b>womb</b> <b>transplant</b> from a dead donor was {{performed}} on a Turkish woman who was born without a womb, but has her own ovaries. She is in good condition and the womb is functional. In the year 2000 in Saudi Arabia a similar transplant {{was performed}}, but from a live donor. Although womb transplants {{have been successful in}} animals such as mice, rats and sheep, the prevailing opinion in the field is that the risks are too great. Apart from risks of rejection of the new womb, there is concern that the drugs necessary for prevention of rejection of the donated womb might harm the fetus.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMedical {{sciences}} {{have been}} advancing rapidly with {{the invention of}} various technologies such as xenotransplantation, ectogenesis and <b>womb</b> <b>transplant.</b> These technologies bring with them several ethical and moral issues {{that need to be}} carefully scrutinised {{in order to protect the}} interests of individuals and society. Although these techniques have yet to make their way into Malaysia, research and evaluation on their potential benefits and harms is pertinent to ensure that sufficient legal mechanism is put in place when these techniques are eventually introduced in this country. This paper thus aims to identify the legal, moral and ethical dilemmas brought by the advent of these technologies in the context of Malaysia as a multi-racial country with Islam declared as the official religion...|$|E
40|$|Event synopsis: Organised {{by legal}} {{scholars}} in the Sussex Law School, the conference {{is the first to}} explore issues of gender as it relates to family responsibility in law - areas that continue to present problems for the courts and law makers. Conference organiser and Senior Lecturer in Law, Craig Lind, says: "Families are changing and the law cannot ignore those changes. The Government has just announced legislation to give women priority when applying for jobs - what {{does this have to do}} with family responsibilities?" A wide-ranging and fascinating selection of papers from international experts in law, sociology, social policy and philosophy will address this and many other questions, including: How much is a short marriage worth? Should unmarried couples walk away from relationship with impunity? What are the responsibilities of absent fathers? Should separated parents share their children equally? Do IVF babies need fathers? Should we allow <b>womb</b> <b>transplants?</b> What should we do about "elder abuse"? Should grandparents have a legal status in the lives of their grandchildren? Does the 'Nanny State' know better than parents what's best for children? Family law has to respond to some of life's most difficult - and controversial - experiences. It also needs to evolve and adapt to new experiences involving, for example, youth crime and parental responsibility, immigration, medical advances such as infertility treatments, social change and transformed family structures. However, Mr Lind says: "Making changes to family law is notoriously difficult. Judges and law makers have - individually - very diverse understandings of the social and family responsibilities people have. Resolving them into the uniform patterns that a legal system needs is, therefore, almost impossible. "At the moment there are a number of problems relating to the family that desperately need legal resolution. But it isn't just family law that must change - we will also be considering changes in employment law, corporate law, criminal law and immigration law. ...|$|R
