5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja {{also tells}} Eagle that Andy wasn't behind the attacks, saying it <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> and goes {{with her to}} see what she discovered. It is {{revealed}} that the enigmatic Black Hole Army, under the command of Sturm, is the true enemy. Using a CO doppelganger clone of Andy, Sturm stirred up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them. Once this is revealed, the four countries unite to drive Black Hole out of their land, the Cosmo Land, with COs automatically chosen depending on the paths the player took during the game.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Confidence and Paranoia" [...] (1988), Lister {{believes}} {{that the only reason}} that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> due to her wonky vision from a concussion. Lister, {{with the help of a}} solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.|$|E

2500|$|... "Let It Happen" [...] {{opens the}} album, {{and is about}} [...] "finding {{yourself}} always {{in this world of}} chaos and all this stuff going on around you and always shutting it out because you don't {{want to be part of}} it. But at some point, you realise it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'." [...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know they aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E

60|$|Presently, he {{was aware}} there <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> pacing the garden. Who could it be?--Not Blatherwick, for he passed the Sabbath with his grandmamma at Clapham; not Scully surely, for he always went to Bethesda Chapel, and to a select prayer-meeting afterwards. Alas! it WAS Scully; for though that gentleman SAID {{that he went to}} chapel, we have it for a fact that he did not always keep his promise, and was at this moment {{employed}} in rehearsing an extempore speech, which he proposed to deliver at St. Stephen's.|$|E
60|$|The {{light from}} the tiny lamps fell {{in all sorts of}} odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows.

I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible {{experience}} in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took a few}} {{cautious}} {{steps toward}} the door. Suddenly he stopped short and held his breath. Very slowly he turned his head, and listened intently. Someone was stirring in the next room. There was a connecting door, hidden by a curtain, and even as he stood there he heard the handle shake {{as though it were}} being turned. He leaned forward and turned out the electric light. Standing there in the darkness he distinctly heard a key inserted in the lock of the hidden door. He heard it softly opened and the curtain pushed back. There <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> in the room, someone else whom he could not see, someone else who also took an interest in the effects of the murdered man! ...|$|E

60|$|Beyond her stood an undersized, brown-clad {{middle-aged man}} with a big head, a dark face and {{expressive}} brown eyes fixed now in unrestrained admiration on Mary's laughing face. This then was Justin, the incredibly rich and powerful, whose comprehensive operations could make and break a thousand fortunes in a day. He answered Evesham carelessly, with his gaze still on Mary, and in a voice too low for my straining ears. There was some woman in the group also, but she has left nothing upon my mind whatever except an effect of black and a very decorative green sunshade. She greeted Justin's remark, I remember, with the little yelp of laughter that characterized that set. I think too there <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> in the group; but I cannot clearly recall who....|$|E
60|$|Of course, as I say, {{one never}} really knows one's ground, and one may make {{mistakes}} occasionally. But then one's mistakes sometimes turn out {{assets in the}} long-run: if we had never bungled away our American colonies we might never have had the boy from the States to teach us how to wear our hair and cut our clothes, and we must get our ideas from somewhere, I suppose. Even the Hooligan was probably invented in China centuries before we thought of him. England must wake up, as the Duke of Devonshire said the other day; wasn't it? Oh, well, it <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> Not that I ever indulge in despair about the Future; there always have been men who have gone about despairing of the Future, and when the Future arrives it says nice, superior things about their having acted according to their lights. It is dreadful to think that other people's grandchildren may one day rise up and call one amiable.|$|E
