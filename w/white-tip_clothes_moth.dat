Please {{check for}} {{up-to-date}} {{information in the}} OSU Extension Service Catalog: [URL] some homes, <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> can damage garments and other belongings. There are two common species of <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> in the Pacific Northwest: the webbing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella) and the casemaking <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tinea pellionella). The larvae, or immature form, of the moths {{are responsible for the}} damage done to personal belongings...|$|R

50|$|Tineids are unusual among Lepidoptera as {{the larvae}} {{of only a}} very small number of species feed on living plants, the {{majority}} feeding on fungi, lichens, and detritus. The most familiar members of the family are the <b>clothes</b> <b>moths,</b> which have adapted to feeding on stored fabrics. The most widespread of such species are the common <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella), the case-bearing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tinea pellionella), and the carpet moth (Trichophaga tapetzella); the brown-dotted <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Niditinea fuscella) despite its name, preferentially feeds on feathers in bird nests.|$|R
40|$|<b>Clothes</b> <b>moths</b> {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} small moths in the family Tineidae. There are two species of <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> that are of {{considerable}} economic importance. The webbing and the casemaking <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> are worldwide in distribution. The larvae of <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> can feed on and cause damage to fabrics, furs, feathers, wool, carpets, tapestries, drapes, piano felts, upholstered furniture, animal bristled brushes, hair, fish meal found in fish food, synthetics or fabrics, such as cotton, that have been blended with wool, skins, spices, stored tobacco, old clothing, scrap piles, leather, lint, dust, paper, linen, silk, stuffed animals, blankets, and mounted animals...|$|R

50|$|Tineola bisselliella, {{known as}} the common <b>clothes</b> <b>moth,</b> webbing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth,</b> or simply {{clothing}} moth, is a species of fungus moth (family Tineidae, subfamily Tineinae). It is the type species of its genus Tineola. The specific name is commonly misspelled biselliella - for example by G. A. W. Herrich-Schäffer, when he established Tineola in 1853.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: to specify, what the <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> {{represents}} as the species; to reveal, what peculiarities of its biology allow the moth to so violently harm in the museums and impede the struggle against it; to offer the best methods of protection of the museum collections from this vermin. For the first time offered has been the presentation about the <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> as about of the single polymorthic species, which includes the <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> {{as one of the}} forms. It has been shown, that the morphological unhomogeneity of the <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> is connected with its ecological ununiformity. The whole number of the new methods has been offered for the struggle against the moth. In practice of the antimoth protection of materials in the museums, the inert gaseous media with the decreased content of oxygen have successfully been introduced as well as the bacpreparations on the base of the bacteria pathogenous strains, the antiseptics katamin AB and metacide, the secondary metabolites from the roots of the red clover (isochavibetol and its ethyl ether) significantly simplified has been the procedure of diagnostics of the verminAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The common fabric {{destroying}} {{insects in}} Nebraska are <b>clothes</b> <b>moths,</b> carpet beetles, and silverfish. <b>Clothes</b> <b>moths</b> and carpet beetles feed on and digest wool, leather, cotton, silk, and synthetic fibers. They generally infest clothes, carpets, rugs, upholstery, etc. Silverfish feed principally on paper products, glue, paste, wallpaper, starch, and any food products consumed by humans. They also damage clothing, cotton, linen, rayon and ramie fabrics. This extension circular explains these insects {{and the proper}} ways of eliminating them in your household...|$|R

40|$|The common <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella) is {{a serious}} pest of woolen {{products}} of great economic relevance. In large part the control of infestations is based on repeated applications of chemicals with high residual effect and environmental impact. In order to limit the potential damage deriving from the abuse of chemicals and to promote the use of officinal plants, the effect of natural dyes extracted from plants and mordants, commonly used for dyeing woolen fabrics {{in the tradition of}} Sardinia, was investigated. Although the tested natural dyes were not able to make the woolen samples resistant to the <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> larvae, an inhibition effect of oviposition was detected...|$|R
50|$|Like <b>clothes</b> <b>moths,</b> carpet beetles are {{likewise}} {{drawn to}} proteins, {{and can be}} quite destructive. Evidence of an infestation may take of the form of chewed holes, carcasses, or larvae, which appear as small pale worm-like insects.|$|R
50|$|Nemapogon picarella, the pied <b>clothes</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Tineidae family. It was {{described}} by Clerck in 1759. It is found in most of Europe, except Ireland, the Benelux, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Triaxomera fulvimitrella, the four-spotted <b>clothes</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Tineidae family. It {{is found}} in most of Europe, except Ireland, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, Slovenia {{and most of the}} Balkan Peninsula. The habitat {{consists}} of woodlands.|$|R
50|$|The erechthias <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Erechthias minuscula) is a moth of the Tineidae family. It is {{widespread}} {{and has been}} recorded from Africa, Sri Lanka, Java, Australia, the Caroline Islands, Fiji, Samoa, the Marquesas, the West Indies, Hawaii and Florida.|$|R
25|$|Caterpillars of {{most species}} are herbivorous, but not all; some (about 1%) are insectivorous, even cannibalistic. Some feed on other animal products; for example <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> feed on wool, and horn moths {{feed on the}} hooves and horns of dead ungulates.|$|R
50|$|Nemapogon clematella, the barred white <b>clothes</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Tineidae family. It {{is found}} in most of Europe and in North America, {{where it has been}} {{recorded}} from Maryland and North Carolina. The habitat consists of woodlands.|$|R
50|$|Tapestry moths {{complete}} their cycles {{within a year}} and are more like webbing <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> in that they spin webbing in areas where they like to reside. Their speed of development depends entirely upon local temperature, humidity and food supplies.|$|R
30|$|Among {{the traps}} placed out {{there were more}} than 550 that {{contained}} pheromones to attract either the webbing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella) or the case bearing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tinea pellionella). There are observations from more than 29600 of the simpler sticky traps, and it is these that form the basis of much of the discussion here. The data is difficult to interpret and gain an overall sense of distribution or change. On the simplest level it exists on almost 1500 individual spreadsheets collected for management purposes over more than ten years. The data contained on the individual spreadsheets were transformed to a single ASCII file for each territory, which could then be read by a wide range of software.|$|R
30|$|Several hundred traps {{were laid}} that {{included}} pheromones as attractants {{for either the}} webbing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> or less commonly the case bearing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth.</b> The largest number {{were placed in the}} key London properties after 2004. The catch rate was 2.67 moths per trap where pheromone was present, as expected e.g. [9] much greater than the 0.065 moths per trap caught when it was absent; a more than thirty-fold increase in catch rate (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Some 29 % of the traps showed the presence of moths in the case of pheromone traps compared with 3.3 % presence {{in the absence of the}} pheromone. This situation was repeated in the Southeast where the catch rate was 3.18 and 0.03 for the pheromone and non-pheromone traps (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Fewer pheromone traps were laid for the case bearing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> and most of these were in the West. However, here the situation was much as expected with increases in the catch rate 0.97 with pheromones and 0.05 without (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test) and the occupancy (respectively 20 % and 2.1 %).|$|R
50|$|The brown-dotted <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Niditinea fuscella) is {{a species}} of tineoid moth.
