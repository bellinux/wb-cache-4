This representation format, referred to as an uncertainty wedge, {{can be used to}} help solve difficult survey planning problems regarding the spatio-temporal variability of the watercolumn. Though initially developed to work in-line with underway watercolumn sampling hardware (e. g. moving vessel profilers), uncertainty <b>wedge</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques are extensible to investigate problems associated with low-density watercolumn sampling in which only a few sound speed casts are gathered per day. As uncertainty <b>wedge</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques require no sounding data, the overhead of post-processing soundings is circumvented in the situation when one needs to quickly ascertain the impact of a particular sampling regime. In keeping with the spirit of the underlying real-time monitoring tools, a just in time analysis of sound speed casts can help the field operator assess the effects of watercolumn variability during acquisition and objectively seek a watercolumn sampling regime which would balance the opposing goals of maximizing survey efficiency and maintaining reasonable sounding accuracy. In this work, we investigate the particular problem of estimating the uncertainty that would be associated with a particular low-density sound speed sampling regime. A pre-analysis technique is proposed in which a high-density set of sound speed profiles provides a baseline against which various low-density sampling regimes can be tested, the end goal being to ascertain the penalty in sounding confidence that would be associated with a particular low-density sampling regime. In other words, by knowing too much about the watercolumn, one can objectively quantify the impact of not knowing enough. In addition to the goal-seeking field application outlined earlier, this allows for more confi- dent attribution of uncertainty to soundings, a marked improvement over current approaches to refraction uncertainty estimation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{excavation}} of tunnels in saturated soft soils, a pressurized bentonite slurry {{is often used}} to support the tunnel face. The slurry should form a filter cake, which is used to transfer the support pressure onto the soil. This filter cake is constantly removed by the cutter teeth of the TBM during excavation and slurry will infiltrate into the soil while the filter cake rebuilds.

To quantify the influence of these excess pore pressures on the stability of the tunnel face, a simple groundwater-flow model has been incorporated in a <b>wedge</b> stability <b>analysis.</b> For a tunnel in fine sand layers, the pore pressure distribution calculated with this model has been compared with field measurements.

40|$|Soil {{reinforcement}} {{is widely}} used in geotechnical engineering. While there are various means of accounting {{for the presence of}} soil reinforcement in limit analysis and limit equilibrium type calculations, these are often highly problem specific. In this paper a general means of incorporating soil reinforcement within numerical limit analysis calculations is presented. A key feature of this implementation is that the reinforcement is modelled 'in parallel' with the soil model such that allows the soil to flow past the reinforcement as might occur for soil nailing. To illustrate this the Discontinuity Layout Optimization (DLO) numerical analysis procedure is used, and the efficacy of the approach is evaluated via application to reinforced slope problems involving rigid soil nails under plane-strain conditions. The analyses are calibrated against a two-part <b>wedge</b> <b>analysis</b> method such as presented in British Standard BS 8006 : 1995 or AASHTO LRFD Bridge design specifications. It is shown that the DLO-based procedure produces identical results only when the two-part wedge collapse mechanism is prescribed in advance (achieved by artificially strengthening the soil except along predefined failure planes). A more critical mechanism is otherwise predicted, with the soil strength at collapse required to be approximately 10 % higher than predicted by the two-part wedge method (or alternatively soil nail lengths required to be approximately 20 % greater) ...|$|E

40|$|The rat primary {{somatosensory}} cortex (S 1) is remarkable for its conspicuous vertical compartmentalization in barrels and septal columns, which are additionally stratified in horizontal layers. Whereas excitatory neurons {{from each of}} these compartments perform different types of processing, the role of interneurons is much less clear. Among the numerous types of GABAergic interneurons, those producing nitric oxide (NO) are especially puzzling, since this gaseous messenger can modulate neural activity, synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. We used a quantitative morphological approach to investigate whether nitrergic interneurons, which might therefore be considered both as NO volume diffusers and as elements of local circuitry, display features that could relate to barrel cortex architecture. In fixed brain sections, nitrergic interneurons can be revealed by histochemical processing for NADPH-diaphorase (NADPHd). Here, the dendritic arbors of nitrergic neurons from different compartments of area S 1 were 3 D reconstructed from serial 200 -μm thick sections, using 100 x objective and the Neurolucida system. Standard morphological parameters were extracted for all individual arbors and compared across columns and layers. <b>Wedge</b> <b>analysis</b> was used to compute dendritic orientation indices. Supragranular layers displayed the highest density of nitrergic neurons, whereas layer IV contained nitrergic neurons with largest soma area.

Dendritic arbors were {{not confined to the}} boundaries of the column nor layer of their respective soma, being mostly double-tufted and vertically oriented, except in supragranular layers.

40|$|Observations of the {{performance}} of many different types of retaining structures in recent earthquakes show that failures of retaining structures, including braced excavation supports and basement walls, are rare even if the structures were not designed for the actual intensity of the earthquake loading. Therefore, an experimental and analytical study was undertaken to develop {{a better understanding of the}} distribution and magnitude of seismic earth pressures on various types of retaining structures. This report is a second in the series and presents the results of centrifuge model experiments and numerical analyses of seismic response of retaining structures with cohesive backfill. The experimental results show that the static and seismic earth pressures increase linearly with depth and that the resultant acts at 0. 35 H- 0. 4 H, as opposed to 0. 5 - 0. 6 H assumed in current engineering practice. In general, the total seismic load can be expressed using Seed and Whitman’s (1970) notation as: Pae= Pa +ΔPae, where Pa is the static load and ΔPae is the dynamic load increment. In level ground, the dynamic load coefficient can be expressed as Kae=½γH 2 (0. 68 PGAff/g) for basement walls and ΔKae=½γH 2 (0. 42 PGAff/g) for cantilever walls. These results are consistent with similar experiments performed in cohesionless soils by Mikola & Sitar (2013). In sloping ground the seismic coefficient is ΔKae=½γH 2 (0. 7 PGAff/g), which is consistent with Okabe’s (1926) Coulomb <b>wedge</b> <b>analysis</b> of the problem. However, the numerical simulations and Okabe’s (1926) limit state theory suggest that the resultant acts between 0. 37 H- 0. 40 H for typical values of cohesion.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to estimate the stope dimensions for a future underground mine in Tromsdalen, Verdal. Additionally, the most favourable orientation of the stopes and possible stope layouts will be assessed. Initially, surface mapping was conducted and geotechnical features such as joint orientations, roughness, aperture and weathering were registered. The rock mass quality was assessed using the RMR and Q-system, and the results conclude a rock mass of fair to good quality. The surface mapping of the discontinuities in Tromsdalen founds the basis for evaluation of possible wedge failures in the stopes. The author has completed a small <b>wedge</b> <b>analysis</b> in Unwedge. This concludes that the largest stability issue {{is found in the}} roof of the stopes. Various layout options are assessed against safety, criteria from Verdalskalk AS, and economic viability. It is concluded that longhole drilling or simultaneous blasting of benches are the best options. The stope dimensions were assessed with the help of numerical analyses in Phase^{ 2 }. Two vertical cross-sections through the mine was analysed. The following stope dimensions are evaluated: length 100 - 150 m, width 30 m, height 50 m. The rib and crown pillars were tested for a thickness of 15 m, which is considered unstable. An increase in the pillar thickness is advised, and a 3 D analysis of the problem is recommended to get a more accurate image of the situation. The dimension of the stopes are most likely viable, but the author cannot recommend any final dimensions due to insufficient data. The orientation of the stopes are based on the principle of orienting the longitudinal axis of the stope in close proximity to the bisection line of the largest angle of intersection between the two major joint sets. This results in the most favourable stope orientation being approximately 298 &# 176; NW. The author has also conducted a minor literature study regarding Norwegian underground mines. This was in order to gather information about their mine solutions which {{can be used as a}} basis for comparison in the authors investigation of large-scale underground mining in Tromsdalen. In conclusion, to better assess the stability of the rock mass and decide a final design of the underground mine, stress measurements have to be conducted. The application and knowledge about rock stresses in a mining area is of great importance for the development of the mine design. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{available}} data from the literature relating {{to the performance of}} reinforced soil walls indicates that there are some significant deviations between field observations and the assumptions considered in current analytical and design methods. Furthermore, there are inconsistencies evident in the interpretation of the data obtained from instrumented cases relating to the stresses in the reinforced soil, the force in the reinforcement and the state of stress within the reinforced soil mass.;A comparison of the results from twelve current analytical and design methods with the performance of four reinforced soil walls case histories suggests that these methods are inadequate to accurately model reinforced soil walls under working stress conditions. A few methods do provide good prediction for the forces in the reinforcement for simple walls (e. g. walls with limited influence from the facing and the foundation) in terms of the total force required for horizontal force equilibrium when the wall is approaching failure. However, none of the methods give a good prediction of the force distribution between the layers of the reinforcement.;Examining the results from a hypothetical full facing panel soil wall constructed on a rigid foundation reveals that there are two equilibrium conditions to be considered in reinforced soil walls, these are similar to those considered for conventional rigid retaining walls. One is related to the internal equilibrium of the reinforced soil mass, the other is related to external equilibrium of the facing. For a typical wall with a reinforcement length to wall height of 0. 7, the total force required for equilibrium is largely independent of material properties other than the friction angle of the backfill soil and can be determined using calculations based on Rankine active earth pressure theory. Likewise external equilibrium of the facing is also largely independent of material properties and can be determined from a Coulomb active <b>wedge</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, the forces for both equilibrium conditions increase significantly when the reinforcement length to wall height ratio is small.;Material properties and wall geometry {{have a significant effect on}} the distribution of force in the reinforcement layers. The variation in force distribution stems from the requirements to satisfy static equilibrium conditions in response to changes in the stresses in the reinforced soil due to a change in material property and wall geometry. Without considering these interactions, it is difficult to determine the force in the reinforcement precisely.;The numerical results indicate that the deformation in the reinforced soil wall can be significantly affected by the presence of the unreinforced soil above the zero force line which exerts pressure on the reinforced soil mass and causes shear deformation in the reinforced soil. This shear deformation must be considered for accurate assessment of the deformation at the wall face.;There is indication from the numerical results that the most commonly used reinforcement length to wall height ratio of 0. 7 should be used with a minimum soil friction angle of 35 dollar∘dollar...|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty "clinically {{acceptable}} ideal cases " undergoing elective Caesarean section under a standardized regimen of general anaesthesia were studied. In 87 cases the patient was supine throughout the procedure and in 63 cases she was tilted laterally {{by means of a}} <b>wedge.</b> Statistical <b>analysis</b> of the data derived from assays of maternal and cord blood, and of the Apgar-minus-colour scores indicated that: there was among the non-tilted patients a higher incidence, and greater degree, of birth asphyxia and of low A-C scores than in the tilt series, and that this disparity was emphasized by prolongation of the I-D interval; there was a greater variance among the results obtained from the non-tilt series, suggesting that the introduction of a tilt led to a more stable situation. It is suggested that the contrasts reflect the effect of caval occlusion by the gravid uterus, and the introduction of the terms "revealed caval occlusion " and "concealed caval occlusion " is advocated. Possibly, drug-induced depression was observed among infants who were delivered within 10 minutes of induction, but no other neonatal effects referable to the drugs used could be identified. Neonatal depression is, with few exceptions, eithe...|$|R
