40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to explore students’ problems in accomplishing <b>Writing</b> <b>Task</b> <b>1</b> of IELTS Academic Module, {{in terms of}} IELTS Academic Module assessment criteria of <b>Writing</b> <b>Task</b> <b>1</b> (task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy). This study also tried to find solutions to help the students overcome the problems. The present study was largely qualitative. The participants {{of the study were}} nine students and one teacher at an EAP course in a university language center. In order to gain valid data, the study employed triangulation of data collection methods of classroom observation, documentation of students’ texts, and interviews. The data were analyzed qualitatively with the help of some quantitative calculation. First, the data from students’ texts were analyzed based on the assessment criteria of <b>Writing</b> <b>Task</b> <b>1</b> of IELTS Academic Module to identify the students’ problems. Second, the data from classroom observations were summarized and analyzed qualitatively. Next, the data from interviews were transcribed and classified. Finally, the data from the three sources were synthesized to answer the research questions. It was found that the students had most problems with the lexical resource. They were not able to use varied words/good vocabulary, to paraphrase the information given in the task, to choose right word forms, and to use correct spelling and punctuations in their writing. On the other hand, they had fewest problems with the task achievement. Summarizing significant features and writing at least 150 words were the only problems faced by the students. In terms of coherence and cohesion, the students had problems with spelling and making complex sentences but they did not encounter any problem with interpreting the task, using right pronoun, making introduction paragraph and developing body paragraphs. Related to the grammatical range and accuracy, the students mostly had problem with using right adjective/noun/verb/adverb to describe information. They also encountered difficulty in using active and passive voice, in using prepositions in sentences, and in making different types of sentences. Both the teacher and the students did several ways to solve the students’ problems. Teacher’s self-initiated solutions in the forms of written and spoken feedback, student’s self-initiated solutions in the forms of editing and proof-reading, and peer-feedback in the forms of peer-correction and peer-evaluation were employed to cope with the problems. The results of this study are expected to provide information on the actual condition of EAP course focused on IELTS training. They may become useful sources for EAP or/and English Writing teacher to improve their teaching and to give input for other researchers who intend to conduct research in the same field...|$|E

The test, which was {{developed}} and administered by the Language Training and Testing Centre (LTTC) in Taiwan, targets English learners at the CEFR C 1 level (effective operational proficiency). In the testing literature, while some research has been done on tasks which involve non-verbal materials (e.g. Bridges, 2010; Yu & Lin, 2014) and a single verbal text (e.g. Chan, 2011), comparatively little has been done with tasks involving multiple verbal materials at tertiary level (i.e. B 2 or above). In addition, this task type is believed to be most demanding as compared to summary from a single text or summary from non-verbal materials (Severinson Eklundh & Kollberg, 2003). At the time of study, GEPT was the only standardised writing test which provides a reading-into-writing task involving multiple written materials.|$|E

In the Collaborative Planned Condition, 				learners were allowed to interact with a peer during planning 				and they required to independently complete an essay. 				Participants 2 ̆ 7 written products were evaluated on five analytic 				measures covering the areas of Content, Organization, Language 				in Use, Grammar, and Mechanics. The results of MANOVA tests 				indicated that the planned condition had an impact on learners 2 ̆ 7 				written performance in both tasks. Individually considered, 				learners in the Collaborative Planned Condition were able to 				achieve significantly higher scores in all the analytic features 				in <b>Task</b> <b>1</b> (Expository <b>writing</b> <b>task).</b> In contrast, there were no 				significant mean differences between two conditions in <b>Task</b> 2 				(Argumentative <b>writing</b> <b>task).</b> The results also indicated that 				proficiency had influenced learners 2 ̆ 7 written performance in both 				tasks.

It is expected that portfolio assessment can be used to improve the students’ skills of writing in SMA Negeri 4 Yogyakarta, especially at Class XI Social 2. This research was an action research study that consisted of two cycles. In doing the research, the researcher involved 23 students of Class XI Social 2, one English teacher as the collaborator and the researcher herself. In this research, there were two kinds of data. The first data were qualitative. To obtain the qualitative data, the researcher conducted observation, interviews, and evaluating students’ <b>writing</b> <b>tasks.</b> The qualitative data were in the form of field notes, observation checklists result, interview transcripts, and students’ writing. Meanwhile, the quantitative data were presented in the score of the students’ <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> from <b>Task</b> <b>1</b> to <b>Task</b> 2. The result of this study shows that the use of portfolio assessment can improve students’ writing skills. Students’ writing problems can be reduced by applying portfolio assessment. The feedback given by the researcher facilitates the students to find and to correct their errors in the writing aspects, namely content, organisation, vocabulary, language use and mechanics. In reference to the students’ writing scores, the students’ ability in those five aspects of writing improved after the portfolio assessment strategy was given. It can be seen that the students’ mean value gain from <b>Task</b> <b>1</b> to <b>Task</b> 2 in the content aspect is 0. 39; the organisation aspect is 0. 47; then the vocabulary aspect is 0. 48; then the language use aspect is 0. 34; and the mechanics aspect is 0. 32. Besides, portfolio assessment can improve the students’ motivation to write because they got feedback on their writing and they got a different way in assessing writing. It also creates different classroom activities that are more enjoyable because they could find and correct their errors based on the feedback given on their writing and also they did reflections on their pieces of writing...|$|R

Findings also showed that textual grist and opportunities for elaboration in addition to cognitive demand are essential factors when determining the overall rigor of text-based <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> (i. e., analyzing text-based ELA <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> for cognitive demand alone may inflate the rigor of the task). Further findings on <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> quality describe the level of disciplinary authenticity and intellectual authority contained in ELA textbook <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> and why these features are important in determining the quality of ELA <b>writing</b> <b>tasks.</b> The findings from this study suggest the importance of using a disciplinary-specific theory of task quality, including a three-part model of rigor, disciplinary authenticity, and intellectual authority, to assess the quality of ELA <b>writing</b> <b>tasks.</b> Additionally, this study provides suggestions for practitioners including how teachers might revise and supplement ELA textbook <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in order to support student writing...|$|R

40|$|Evaluative {{stance is}} {{constructed}} through the syntactic and lexical choices a writer makes {{to express the}} writer’s attitude, establish and maintain writer-reader relationships and organise discourse. The APPRAISAL theory (Martin & White, 2005) within Halliday’s (1994) Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) {{is one of the}} approaches to explore the ways interpersonal meanings are expressed, and therefore is commonly applied when researching evaluative aspects of language use. Despite the large body of work done on APPRAISAL, there remains a paucity of research focusing on a range of APPRAISAL resources deployed by L 1 English writers and Hong Kong L 2 English writers. Based on a corpus of 60 academic argumentative essays, the present study applied the APPRAISAL systems to conduct a Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (Granger, 1993; 1996) to compare and contrast the evaluative stance construed in L 1 and L 2 texts. The findings show significant differences in the use of evaluative resources between L 1 and L 2 essays in the two <b>writing</b> <b>tasks.</b> L <b>1</b> English writers shifted from GRADUATION resources when discussing a positive topic to ENGAGEMENT resources when addressing a negative issue. In contrast, Hong Kong L 2 English writers demonstrated a consistent and heavy reliance on resources of ATTITUDE in argumentative writing. The underuse of certain evaluative resources draws attention to the need for making the full range of these resources available for L 2 learners. Future academic writing research is expected to take a contrastive corpus-based approach as well as a functional instead of a pragmatic perspective when corpus linguistics and SFL are more closely aligned. published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|R
30|$|The ethnographic {{approach}} to English language learners was not adopted in this study. More {{information on the}} influences of the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> would be gained if researchers could interview learners or conduct a questionnaire on how the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> and the texts affect their learning. This may reveal how much attention learners pay to the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks.</b> This study employed fifty <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in the examinations of universities in central Japan. More samples from other areas in Japan would perhaps build more reliability into data on the range of micro-genres required in the examinations. This study, further, examined only the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> set in 2013. An examination of tasks in multiple years may offer a more precise range of micro-genres than that found in the present study.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{findings from the}} technology-supported implementation of triangulated <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in a pilot interdisciplinary subject for construction disciplines in a Hong Kong university, and discusses these findings {{in relation to the}} broader issues of collecting, assessing, and reporting evidence of student learning in higher education. The <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> were writing-intensive activities delivered through Blackboard Learn 9. 1, including 5 ePortfolio-based (TreeDBNotes 3. 38) individual writing assignments, at least 1 individual blog entry, and 1 end-of-semester group report. 53 students from all departments within the Faculty of Construction and Environment participated in the study. The study was driven by two questions: (i) how might these technology-supported <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> provide triangulated data to demonstrate student learning? (ii) what kinds of other learning evidence could be collected from these <b>writing</b> <b>tasks?</b> The directed content analysis of these <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> found that (i) a longitudinal inclusion of various technology-supported <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> had a positive effect on the attainment of the subject learning outcomes, and that (ii) the educational issues associated with student learning processes and others could also be determined from them. These results suggest that the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> piloted here can serve as a rigorous alternative for demonstrating evidence of student learning. More studies are needed on the generalizability of such an alternative.

When feedback was not provided, the effectiveness of <b>written</b> specific <b>task</b> analyses was inconsistent across groups. In contrast to the controlling effects of <b>written</b> specific <b>task</b> analyses, <b>written</b> generic <b>task</b> analyses, which specified only major task outcomes, when combined with performance feedback (Group 1) did not control responding.

Furthermore, we can also observe the tendency of the students’ deployment of process type to be highly homogeneous. The only explanation I can provide here is that they were taught by the same teacher, used the same materials, wrote the same <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> and had the same limitation of linguistic resources.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives This study investigated: (1) whether maladaptive perfectionism {{predicted}} {{the experience of}} self-conscious emotions such as shame, guilt and pride following an imagined failure and (2) whether self-compassionate writing could reduce shame and guilt and increase pride relative to a control and self-esteem <b>writing</b> <b>task.</b> Design The study used a correlational design to assess the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and self-conscious emotions. The study also used an experimental between-subjects design to investigate the effect of <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> on self-conscious emotions controlling for initial levels of self-conscious emotion using ANCOVA. Methods Ninety-five University of Surrey students completed an online study that manipulated imagined failure on an academic assignment, and measured maladaptive perfectionism and shame, guilt and pride. Participants were then randomly allocated to either a self-compassionate, self-esteem or a control <b>writing</b> <b>task.</b> Self-conscious emotions were then measured again. Results Following imagining failure maladaptive perfectionism was positively associated with state shame and guilt and negatively associated with state pride. When measured after the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks,</b> the means for shame and guilt were lowered and the mean for pride was increased. However, contrary to predictions, shame was not predicted by writing condition, guilt remained highest following completion of a self-compassionate <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> and pride was highest following {{the completion of the}} control-writing task. Conclusions Maladaptive perfectionism is correlated with self-conscious emotions following imagined failure. Self-compassionate <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> {{do not appear to be}} more effective at improving self-conscious emotion than other <b>writing</b> <b>tasks...</b>|$|R
