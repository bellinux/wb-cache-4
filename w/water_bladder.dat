A committee of Caribbean nations realized the local governments could not provide the support that Grenada needed in its aftermath, and thus turned to international assistance. Within a day of Ivan passing to the south of Grenada, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) deployed 67,600gallons of water, 500rolls of plastic sheeting, four 10,000liter <b>water</b> <b>bladder</b> kits, and a water treatment kit; assistance from USAID totaled $6million (2004USD) within a few weeks of the storm's passage, primarily in aid for reconstruction and rehabilitation. In the weeks subsequent to the hurricane, the European Commission Humanitarian aid Office (ECHO) provided €3million (2004EUR). By a year later, housing redevelopments and disaster preparation problems continued after being impacted by Hurricane Emily; as a result, the ECHO provided €1.2million (2005EUR) to Grenada in September 2005. Nine months after the hurricane, Chinese officials provided assistance in reconstruction and handling foreign debts after meeting with the Grenadian Prime Minister; in 2007, Chinese officials funded {{the construction of a new}} $40million (2007USD) cricket stadium near St. George's. The Caribbean Development Bank approved a $10million loan (2004USD) requested by the government of Grenada in July 2005, which was intended to assist in long-term development of the housing, business, and environmental sectors. Emergency operations in Grenada in coordination with the Pan American Disaster Response Unit ended in July 2005.|$|E

40|$|Cryotherapy {{application}} {{is a widely}} clinically used therapeutic technique using ice or cold water applied to the skin surface to reduce local blood flow. While beneficial, cryotherapy treatment does {{have the potential to}} induce some detrimental physiological side effects. For example, cryotherapy treatment induces pronounced tissue ischemia that is sustained for hours even during a post-treatment rewarming period. PURPOSE: To investigate the role of adrenergic receptor activation on cutaneous blood flow during 30 min of cryotherapy as well as during the subsequent 1 hr of passive rewarming. We hypothesized that adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction is involved in pronounced and sustained cutaneous vasoconstriction that occurs during cooling and passive rewarming. METHODS: To date 4 complete data sets have been collected with 2 partial, incomplete datasets. A commercially available cryotherapy unit with a water perfused bladder was used. The bladder was placed on the lateral portion of the calf. Four microdialysis membranes were threaded through the dermis of the skin directly underneath the <b>water</b> <b>bladder.</b> One site was perfused with lactated ringers solution (CON), one with bretylium tosylate (BRE), one with propranolol+yohimbine+BIBP (PBY), and one with propranolol+BIBP (PB). Skin temperature (SkT) and skin vascular conductance (SkVC) was measured at each site. Subjects had 0 °C water perfused through the cryotherapy bladder for 30 min, followed by passive rewarming (i. e. water shut off) for 1 hr, followed by direct heating with 46 °C for 10 min. RESULTS: SkT fell from 33 °C to 17. 7 °C during 30 min of cold water application across all sites. SkVC at CON was reduced 80...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} for {{the cooperative}} research program for which this report {{has been written}} was to provide separate NCT facility user support for the students, faculty and scientists who would be doing the U. S. Department of Energy Office (DOE) of Science supported advanced radiotargeted research at the WSU 1 megawatt TRIGA reactor. The participants were the Idaho National laboratory (INL, P. I., Dave Nigg), the Veterinary Medical Research Center of Washington State University (WSU, Janean Fidel and Patrick Gavin), and the Washington State University Nuclear Radiation Center (WSU, P. I., Gerald Tripard). A significant number of DOE supported modifications {{were made to the}} WSU reactor in order to create an epithermal neutron beam {{while at the same time}} maintaining the other activities of the 1 MW reactor. These modifications were: (1) Removal of the old thermal column. (2) Construction and insertion of a new epithermal filter, collimator and shield. (3) Construction of a shielded room that could accommodate the very high radiation field created by an intense neutron beam. (4) Removal of the previous reactor core fuel cluster arrangement. (5) Design and loading of the new reactor core fuel cluster arrangement in order to optimize the neutron flux entering the epithermal neutron filter. (6) The integration of the shielded rooms interlocks and radiological controls into the SCRAM chain and operating electronics of the reactor. (7) Construction of a motorized mechanism for moving and remotely controlling the position of the entire reactor bridge. (8) The integration of the reactor bridge control electronics into the SCRAM chain and operating electronics of the reactor. (9) The design, construction and attachment to the support structure of the reactor of an irradiation box that could be inserted into position next to the face of the reactor. (Necessitated by the previously mentioned core rearrangement). All of the above modifications were successfully completed and tested. The resulting epithermal beam of 1 x 10 {sup 9 } n/sec-cm{sup 2 } was measured by Idaho National Laboratory with assistance from WSU's Neutron Activation Analysis Group. The beam is as good as our initial proposals for the project had predicted. In addition to all of the design, construction and insertion of the hardware, shielding, electronics and radiation monitoring systems there was considerable manpower and effort put into changes in the Technical Specifications of the reactor and implementing procedures for use of the new facility. This staff involvement is one of the reasons we requested special facility support from the DOE. Once the facility was competed and all of the recalibrations and measurements made to characterize the differences between this reactor core and the previous core we began to assist INL in making their beam measurements with foils and phantoms. Although we proposed support for only one additional staff position to support this new NCT facility the staff support provided by the WSU Nuclear Radiation Center was greater than had been anticipated by our initial proposal. INL was also assisted in the testing of a heavy water (deuterated <b>water)</b> <b>bladder</b> that can be inserted into the collimator in order to produce an intense, external thermal neutron beam. The external epithermal and/or thermal neutron beam capability remains available for use, if funding becomes available for future research projects...|$|E
