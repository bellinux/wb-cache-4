Over the next five hundred years, he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being <b>weighed</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying. When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane. When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos {{at the center of}} Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure. He performs this act and Lightning does battle him, but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{large number}} of Germans poured through the breach in the Roman {{frontline}} and charged the centre of the Roman rear line. This position was held by the elite Primani legion, which stopped the German attack in its tracks and then counterattacked, routing the breakthrough force. The breach in the front line was presumably filled, either by the separated wings of the front line reconnecting, or by the Primani advancing from the rear line (Ammianus does not specify which). The front line, now extended on the left flank by the rear line left wing, (and presumably by Severus' victorious division), began pushing the Germans back, and gradually hemmed them in from the flanks. At this point, the Germans were already exhausted and demoralised by their lack of progress and severe losses. The mass of their army was now trapped in an ever-tighter Roman crescent, with the troops on the edges being methodically cut down and the ones in the middle packed tightly together and unable to move. Finally, after more relentless pressure from the Romans, the German line collapsed: as panic spread through their ranks, the Germans broke formation and ran for their lives. Many did not run fast enough: pursued {{all the way to the}} Rhine by Roman cavalry and infantry, many were cut down as they ran. Large numbers attempted to swim across the river, but many drowned, hit by Roman missiles or <b>weighed</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> their armour.|$|E

5|$|The German host {{was waiting}} for the Romans, {{probably}} drawn up on the crest of the hill, to give Chnodomar's men the advantage of the slope. The German left wing was held by Chnodomar and his cavalry. Demonstrating that he was well aware of the threat posed by the Roman heavy cavalry, Chnodomar had devised a stratagem. He interspersed lightly armed infantry among his cavalry. These were easy to conceal in the standing grain. The idea was that in a mêlée, the foot soldiers would bring down the cataphracts by crawling along the ground and stabbing their horses in their underbellies, which were unprotected. The dismounted riders, <b>weighed</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> their armour, could then easily be despatched on the ground. The German right wing blocked the highway to Strasbourg, while in the woods beyond the highway were a substantial force of warriors hidden in ambush on Chnodomar's orders. The right wing was under his nephew Serapio (who was given his Greek name by his Hellenophile father). Although still a teenager, Serapio had already proved a military leader worthy of his uncle. The rest of the line was probably divided into pagi units under five major kings and ten petty kings.|$|E

He was no longer bent to the ground, like an over-nursed flower of spring, that, shooting up beyond its strength, is <b>weighed</b> <b>down</b> even <b>by</b> its own coronal of blossoms. His eyes were bright, his countenance composed, an air of concentrated energy was diffused over his whole person, much unlike its former languor. He sat at a table with several secretaries, who were arranging petitions, or registering the notes made during that day's audience. Two or three petitioners were still in attendance. I admired his justice and patience. Those who possessed a power of living out of London, he advised immediately to quit it, affording them the means of so doing. Others, whose trade was beneficial to the city, or who possessed no other refuge, he provided with advice for better avoiding the epidemic; relieving overloaded families, supplying the gaps made in others by death. Order, comfort, and even health, rose under his influence, as from the touch of a magician's wand.|$|R

This forces them to look down in humility at the pavement, which depicts examples of sinful Pride such as Arachne.

The political elimination of dynastic heirs from prominent political families who have dominated Indian politics for decades (Palaniappan Chidambaram, Salman Khurshid, Oscar Fernandes, Sachin Pilot) has resulted in the advent of a new breed of Indian politicians who feel no obligation to stick to traditional approaches and constraints in domestic and foreign relations.

Following their disastrous defeat at the battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ghagra cholis and entertain the court as nautch girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom.

50|$|The {{second book}} of Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy is {{structured}} around the seven deadly sins. The most serious sins, {{found at the}} lowest level, are the abuses of the most divine faculty. For Dante and other thinkers, a human's rational faculty makes humans more like God. Abusing that faculty with pride or envy <b>weighs</b> <b>down</b> the soul the most. Abusing one's passions with wrath {{or a lack of}} passion as with sloth also <b>weighs</b> <b>down</b> the soul {{but not as much as}} the abuse of one's rational faculty. Finally, abusing one's desires for to have one's physical needs met via greed, gluttony, or lust abuses a faculty that humans share with animals. This is still an abuse that <b>weighs</b> <b>down</b> the soul, but it does not <b>weigh</b> it <b>down</b> like other abuses.

25|$|The tour itself began uneventfully, {{although}} Hutton {{was dismissed}} {{by his first}} ball of the tour, in a warm up match against Bermuda. The first-class matches began in Jamaica; the M.C.C. team inflicted only the third defeat on Jamaica by a touring side {{in the first game}} (Hutton had played in another when Yorkshire won a match on their 1936 tour) and he second was drawn. As the Test series began, Hutton wanted to exploit what he saw as a West Indian weakness against pace which had been exploited by Australia in 195152; he picked four fast bowlers but had misread the pitch, which played very slowly. West Indies were able to build up a big score before England collapsed to the West Indies spinners. Stollmeyer batted again, receiving abuse from the crowd for not enforcing the follow-on, and set a target of 457 to win. Although Hutton believed that the target was achievable on the easy batting pitch, England's batsmen again failed, losing by 140 runs. Both captains employed time-wasting tactics in the match, and used negative leg theory bowling, outside leg stump. Hutton himself scored 24 and 56; in the second Test, he scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another loss. He had lost his seventh consecutive toss in Tests and despite the loss of early wickets, West Indies scored 383. Wisden criticised Hutton for not placing fielders on the boundary to cut off runs. In reply, England batted very slowly, batting nearly 160 overs for a score of 181; Wisden believed that Hutton was <b>weighed</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> responsibility, batting for four and a half hours before being caught from a desperate attacking shot, possibly affected by barracking from the crowd. West Indies batted again and set a target of 495. England were bowled out for 313 to lose by 181 runs.|$|E
