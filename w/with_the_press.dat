5|$|Schwarzkopf retired {{shortly after}} the end of the war and {{undertook}} a number of philanthropic ventures, only occasionally stepping into the political spotlight before his death from complications of pneumonia in late 2012. A hard-driving military commander with a strong temper, Schwarzkopf was considered an exceptional leader by biographers and was noted for his abilities as a military diplomat and in dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taft did {{not enjoy}} the easy {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> that Roosevelt had, choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had. His administration marked a change in style from the charismatic leadership of Roosevelt to Taft's quieter passion {{for the rule of}} law.|$|E

5|$|The gallery {{itself was}} a fashionable hit with the public. Newspapers carried updates of the {{construction}} of the gallery, down to drawings for the proposed façade. The Daily Advertiser featured a weekly column on the gallery from May through August (exhibition season). Artists who had influence <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> and Boydell himself, published anonymous articles to heighten interest in the gallery, which they hoped would increase sales of the edition.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners' leaders {{made three}} demands: {{a meeting with}} Attorney General Joseph Berinson, access to the media, and a {{guarantee}} of no retribution afterwards. The next morning, after 19 hours, the hostages were released, even though only the third demand had been met. Prisoners did, however, {{have an opportunity to}} communicate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> during the siege, as the riot was a live media event with television helicopters filming from overhead.|$|E
5|$|Ballo's father wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's death, and refrained from {{interviews}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> until the book was published in 2009. Titled Kaja: 1988–2008, the book became a bestseller in Norway. It reached second place on the bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. The author stated he wrote the book as an expository method to both process his grief, inform his family about the controversy, and educate the public about suicide.|$|E

On {{the day before the}} match travelled to Harrow on the Hill where they stayed at the Kings Head Hotel. They were open <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> about their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Cardiff were free to choose their first choice team, unhindered by injuries. They selected the same team as had featured against Reading in the semi-final, with the exception of Harry Wake, despite his experience from playing in the FA Cup final two seasons prior.|$|E
5|$|Eidos's German {{branch and}} the KMF agency handled {{marketing}} for Lara Croft. Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media ventures with its {{new version of the}} character.|$|E
5|$|Kartodikromo {{published}} another novel, Matahariah, in 1919. It {{was based}} on the life of the Dutch spy Mata Hari. On 15 December 1919, Kartodikromo left Sinar Hindia and took a position as head of Soero Tamtomo, published by the Forestry Union Staff Union Wono Tamtomo. He was imprisoned for six months for one of his writings, Sjairnja Sentot (Sentot's Poem), with the paper. In 1921 Kartodikromo moved to Salatiga and became involved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> there. He was sentenced to two years in a Batavian prison for another of his writings.|$|E

5|$|Schwarzkopf {{returned}} to the United States after the Gulf War as a national hero, {{and his ability to}} effectively deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> left him a positive image. Schwarzkopf indicated a desire to retire from the military in mid-1991. He was initially considered for promotion alternatively to General of the Army or to Army Chief of Staff, and was ultimately asked to assume the latter post, but he declined. He was later questioned about running for political office, but, considering himself an independent, expressed little interest in doing so. Schwarzkopf was not vocal about his political opinions during his military career. He retired from the military in August 1991, moving to Tampa, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Stengel was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in {{the top half of the}} standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to the polls divided, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created some confusion among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks and a loss of Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls.|$|E

5|$|The Hanada {{family had}} {{generally}} received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> holding them {{up as the}} ideal Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them. Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy and the outside world had been noted, with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and Wakanahona having a warmer personality. However, upon their father's death from cancer in May 2005, a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media. Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity, but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother, as is traditional.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack and {{background}} score were composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Vairamuthu. The soundtrack was released through Star Music. Strips of herbal rejuvenator capsules were sold {{along with the}} film's music cassettes. Before the film's release, Rahman asked Ravikumar if the soundtrack could be released in August 1999. Ravikumar informed Rahman that he had already discussed a release date <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> and that Rahman would be blamed for any delay. To make the deadline, Rahman did a live re-recording of both the soundtrack and score to finish them on time.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Lie purchased publishing {{rights to the}} Malay-language newspaper Pembrita Betawi, based in Batavia and edited by W. Meulenhoff, for 1,000gulden. He again borrowed from his friends. From mid-1886, Lie's publishing house (which he had moved to Batavia) was credited as the newspaper's printer. While busy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> he wrote or contributed to four books. Two were pieces of nonfiction, one a collection of Chinese prophecies and the last outlined lease laws. The third was a partial translation of the One Thousand and One Nights, a collection already popular with Malay audiences. The last was his first novel, Tjhit Liap Seng. Following a group of educated persons in mainland China, Tjhit Liap Seng is credited as the first Chinese Malay novel.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} the on-screen character directly using the keyboard or gamepad. The player progresses by navigating platform game puzzles and shooting enemies with the equipped weapon. When the player collects multiple weapons, {{they may be}} toggled at any time <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> of a button. Defeating enemies sometimes yields yellow triangular objects, which give experience points to weapons when collected. Weapons may be improved up to level three, but taking damage causes weapons to lose experience and levels. Health and missile capacity upgrades are scattered throughout the game world. The player must interact {{with a variety of}} non-player characters and objects to complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, in 1964, Mary Poppins is to {{have its}} world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches Mary Poppins {{with a lack of}} enthusiasm, {{particularly}} during the animated sequences. She gradually warms {{to the rest of the}} film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.|$|E
5|$|After {{ending his}} work at Verulamium, Wheeler turned his {{attention}} to the late Iron Age hill-fort of Maiden Castle near to Dorchester, Dorset, where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937. Co-directed by Wheeler, Tessa, and the Curator of Dorset County Museum, Charles Drew, the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the Society of Antiquaries and the Dorset Field Club. With around 100 assistants each season, the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in Britain up to that point, with Wheeler organising weekly meetings <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> to inform them about any discoveries. His excavation report was published in 1943 as Maidan Castle, Dorset. The report's publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of Wheeler's approach and interpretations; in his review of the book, the archaeologist W. F. Grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation, noting that Wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio-economic issues of the community at Maidan Castle, aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to British archaeology. Over coming decades, as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of Iron Age Britain, much of Wheeler's interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong, in particular by the work of the archaeologist Niall Sharples.|$|E
