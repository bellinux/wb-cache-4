5|$|The Swiss did {{not accept}} these resolutions of the Imperial Diet, and they {{explicitly}} refused to pay the common penny. They had no interest whatsoever in sending troops to serve in an army under Habsburg authority, nor in paying taxes, nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> accept any foreign court's jurisdiction; and they had succeeded in securing public peace within their territories reasonably well by themselves. They simply considered the whole proposal a curtailing of their freedom. The Swiss were by far not the only members of the empire who {{refused to accept the}} resolutions, but Maximilian would use their refusal later as a pretext to place the Swiss Confederacy under an imperial ban (Reichsacht).|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E

In these evening entertainments, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> sing, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> dance, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> fondle, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> quarrel, and knock the cans and furniture about; and, when I was in favour, I was admitted to share their society, for Museau, jealous of his dignity, or not willing that his men should witness his behaviour, would allow none {{of them to be}} familiar with him.|$|R

5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies <b>would,</b> <b>they</b> predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, sometimes in the form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of all go to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then <b>would</b> <b>they</b> pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E
5|$|Reluctantly, Dowding defined three categories, A, B and C. Category A {{units were}} {{to bear the}} brunt of the fighting, and were to be kept at full {{strength}} in aircraft and pilots. Only if the A units suffered exceptionally high losses <b>would</b> <b>they</b> be replaced. B units were relief units, to be maintained at operational strength and only used if absolutely necessary. C units were generally stripped down to just five or six pilots. These units were devoted to training new pilots. Although not fit for fighter-fighter action, they could defend quieter areas. The system potentially could have had fatal results for Fighter Command, with C units becoming less and less effective. But the system had not been running long enough by 14 September for it to have a serious impact on Fighter Command's strength. The replacement units were sufficient in number and effectiveness to continue to replace exhausted units. By 15 September, the C units could still give a good account of themselves in battle.|$|E

But I entreated them to {{consider}} the answer was to their sovereign, and to whom they made a great profession of duty and respect, and at least they ought to give their reasons why they declined a treaty at York, and to name some other place, or humbly to desire his Majesty to name some other place; but to send word <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not treat at York, I could deliver no such message, for when put into English it <b>would</b> signify <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not treat at all.|$|R
5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how <b>would</b> <b>they</b> use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath Alliance – the {{original}} name of Birmingham City Football Club – played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green district of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where St Andrew's would be built. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with an estimated capacity of 3,000 spectators; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. Interest in the team grew, {{and a year later}} they moved again, this time to a rented field in Small Heath, situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. This ground, which became known as Muntz Street, had four sides of open terracing, a small covered wooden stand, and a changing-room for the players. When first opened it could hold approximately 10,000 spectators. Over the years the height of the terracing was raised, which increased the capacity to around 30,000, but this became insufficient to cope with the demand. The attendance at a match in 1905 against local rivals Aston Villa was officially recorded as 28,000 spectators, but several thousand more climbed walls or forced turnstiles to gain entry. The landlords refused to sell the freehold of the ground, nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> permit major extensions to be made. As the board of directors estimated that staying at Muntz Street was costing the club £2,000 a year (£ at today's prices), they began the search for an alternative site.|$|E
25|$|In October 1687, James {{asked the}} Lord Lieutenants to provide three {{standard}} questions to {{all members of}} the Commission of the Peace: <b>would</b> <b>they</b> consent to the repeal of the Test Act and the penal laws; <b>would</b> <b>they</b> assist candidates who would do so; and <b>would</b> <b>they</b> accept the Declaration of Indulgence.

In a Newtype poll, Cagalli was voted as the most popular female anime character from the 2000s. Cagalli was also the winner in a Sunrise poll that asked fans what female character from Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny <b>would</b> <b>they</b> want to see in swimsuit. She was also first in another that asked what female characters from the Gundam franchise <b>would</b> <b>they</b> want to see in a wedding dress. Two other polls from the same site asked fans what was the most memorable characters from Gundam SEED and from Gundam SEED Destiny; Cagalli was fourth in both of them.|$|E

25|$|Because contractions that occupy {{only the}} lower half of the braille cell mostly double as basic {{punctuation}} marks, legibility requires that, with few exceptions, they may not come in contact with actual punctuation marks; if they <b>would,</b> <b>they</b> should instead be spelled out. That is, any cell which follows without an intervening space should contain a dot in its top row. Most of the difficulties of when to use contractions are due to this complication.|$|E
25|$|The {{immigration}} of Zoroastrians to India continued, and by 1477 {{they had lost}} all contact with Persia. Not until three hundred years had passed <b>would</b> <b>they</b> come into contact. Zoroastrians also played a notable role during the freedom movements of India. There were also subsequent migrations, especially resulting from attempts of Safavids' to convert their subjects to Shia Islam in the sixteenth century. This added to the Parsi population and cemented their close association with Iran.|$|E
25|$|However, the Japanese {{government}} eventually {{decided it}} would not remove {{the remains of the}} Japanese war dead to a separate cemetery nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> repatriate the ashes. This was because the Japanese surrendered personnel had put so much effort to erect a memorial in the cemetery for their fallen comrades earlier and as such the memorial was a type of a shrine in itself as well as the fact that all ashes had been entombed in one single mound which made any form of identification impossible.|$|E

25|$|In 1687, James {{prepared}} to pack Parliament with his supporters {{so that it}} would repeal the Test Act and the penal laws. James was convinced by addresses from Dissenters that he had their support and so could dispense with relying on Tories and Anglicans. James instituted a wholesale purge of those in offices under the crown opposed to James's plan. In August the lieutenancy was remodelled and in September over one thousand members of the city livery companies were ejected. In October James gave orders for the lords lieutenants in the provinces to provide three standard questions to all members of the Commission of the peace: <b>would</b> <b>they</b> consent to the repeal of the Test Act and the penal laws; <b>would</b> <b>they</b> assist candidates who would do so; and they were requested to accept the Declaration of Indulgence. In December it was announced that all the offices of deputy lieutenants and Justices of the Peace would be revised. Therefore, during {{the first three months of}} 1688, hundreds of those who gave hostile replies to the three questions asked were dismissed. More far-reaching purges were applied to the towns: in November a regulating committee was founded to operate the purges. Corporations were purged by agents given wide discretionary powers in an attempt to create a permanent royal electoral machine. Finally, on 24 August 1688, James ordered writs to be issued for a general election.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Damer and David Deamer {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that cell membranes cannot be formed in salty seawater, and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a superorganism rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved <b>would</b> <b>they</b> gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those who}} believe that the term Gurjara was {{originally}} a tribal designation, there are disagreements over whether they were native Indians or foreigners. The proponents of the foreign origin theory point out that the Gurjara-Pratiharas suddenly emerged as a political power in north India around 6th century CE, shortly after the Huna invasion of that region. Critics of the foreign origin theory argue that there is no conclusive evidence of their foreign origin: they were well-assimilated in the Indian culture. Moreover, if they invaded Indian through the north-west, it is inexplicable why <b>would</b> <b>they</b> choose to settle in the semi-arid area of present-day Rajasthan, rather than the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain.|$|E
