500|$|The Smith family {{initially}} {{lived on}} a small farm in Sewickley, Pennsylvania but moved in 1872 to Allegheny City when George Smith was 10 years old. The Smiths eventually settled {{in the neighborhood of}} Pleasant Valley, which was located across the Ohio River from Pittsburgh in the present day city neighborhood of California-Kirkbride. George Smith's father died within a year (in late 1872 or 1873), which created financial hardships for his mother and sisters and resulted in George going to work at the age of 12 at the local cork cutting factory (possibly Armstrong Cork Co.) for $5 per week. [...] Smith was not happy with this occupation, once remarking on the banality of the profession later in life: [...] " [...] thought [...] could do a little better than cutting corks, inasmuch as [...] knew how to divide six by two." [...] Smith set aside money from his <b>weekly</b> <b>pay</b> (after giving the majority to his mother) to purchase and train gamecocks, hiding the fowl from his devout Roman Catholic mother and sisters who greatly disapproved of gambling. He also bet on the outcomes of National League baseball games in Pittsburgh pool halls and would attribute his often sizable winnings to pay raises at the cork factory.|$|E

2500|$|Each man had {{specific}} duties. Joe Esposito {{served as}} Elvis' chief road manager and personal aide for 17 years. Marty Lacker, another aide, {{also served as}} Elvis' chief personal aide for several years. Esposito and Lacker were Presley's best men at his wedding. Sonny West was responsible for security at Presley concerts. Red West was one of Presley's earliest friends from their school days, his first bodyguard which he would remain until {{the last year of}} Presley's life, and in 1954 had acted as a driver for Elvis, Scotty Moore and Bill Black when they first toured the American South performing as the [...] "Blue Moon Boys." [...] Priscilla Presley said these employees were paid an average of $250 per week during the 1960s, which rose to $425 per week in the 1970s, however one pay stub does exist that showed a <b>weekly</b> <b>pay</b> of only $35 for the '63-65 era. Each Christmas all Presley employees received bonus checks. Some members of this inner circle became close friends who served as replacements for the normal everyday friendships Presley's fame would not allow. Marty Lacker and Elvis' cousin, Billy Smith, were probably the closest true friends of Elvis according to some in the group. Known for his generosity (attributed by Presley himself to an impoverished childhood), he bought some of these employees homes as wedding gifts and frequently bought new Cadillac automobiles for employees, relatives and friends.|$|E

Previous panics have been arrested by good luck; this last one in America, for example, found Europe strong and prosperous and helpful. In every panic period {{there is a huge}} dislocation of business enterprises, vast multitudes of men are thrown out of employment, there is grave social and political disorder; but in the end, so far, things have an air of having recovered. But now, suppose the panic wave a little more universal--and panic waves tend to be more extensive than they used to be. Suppose that when securities fall all round, and gold appreciates in New York, and frightened people begin to sell investments and hoard gold, the same thing happens {{in other parts of the}} world. Increase the scale of the trouble only two or three times, and would our system recover? Imagine great masses of men coming out of employment, and angry and savage, in all our great towns; imagine the railways working with reduced staffs on reduced salaries or blocked by strikers; imagine provision dealers stopping consignments to retailers, and retailers hesitating to give credit.

The author analyses the image of Church in mentioned <b>weeklies,</b> <b>paying</b> attention to the way of description and – what is particularly important – to the way of defining Church by the authors of analysed publications. “The passing of John Paul II” evoked wide discussion concerning condition, activity, past and future of the Catholic Church as a public institution in Poland. The behaviour of Church “in days of passing John Paul II” was rather critically judged, the Church was accused of helplessness, lack of organization, lack of readiness to take the initiative, not being a leader of faithful. The authorities of Church were evaluated in a very critical way, however, the message concerning the activity of parishes and attitude of individual priests had a positive undertone. Analysed weeklies distinctly generalized negative opinions while positive messages had its individual heroes and were not attributed in favor of the whole Church...|$|R
