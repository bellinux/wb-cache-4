25|$|Supporters {{believe that}} this plan <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving {{domestic}} issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five}} years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E
25|$|Bucket : This {{pattern is}} similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the {{opposite}} hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a 'bucket' form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this often means is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according {{to the nature of the}} Singleton planet that forms the handle of the pattern.

2500|$|Ecosystem {{services}} are {{the benefits that}} humans derive from ecological systems. Today, {{one of the arguments}} for protecting salt marshes is to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} these services. Salt marshes sequester nitrogen, filtering runoff water and reducing nitrogen input to estuaries (Valiela and Cole 2002). Salt marshes also provide essential refuge habitat for young fish and crustaceans, provisioning coastal fisheries (Boesch and Turner 1984) that account for 90% of the world’s fish catch (UNEP 2006). Salt marshes also sequester carbon, which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> ecosystem service as climate change intensifies (Chmura et al. 2003). Arguably the most important ecosystem service salt marshes provide is to act as natural sea barriers because grasses bind soils, prevent shoreline erosion, attenuate waves, and reduce coastal flooding (Costanza et al. 2008).|$|E

2500|$|While viral vectors are 40% more {{efficient}} in transferring genes, {{they are not}} fully appreciated for in vivo gene delivery because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an inflammatory response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild edema or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system's enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after intraarticular injection and this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> disadvantage. [...] However, majority of problems associated with gene delivery using viral vectors solved by ex vivo gene delivery method.
