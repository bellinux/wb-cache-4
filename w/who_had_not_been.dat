5|$|Karl Mack {{became the}} new main {{commander}} in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the infantry {{on the eve}} of war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training; new units were led by commanders <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> given sufficient tactical training in using their units.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> in Dublin at the time) {{denied that he}} had given the least {{authority}} to any person to make any such statement in his name. However, his disavowal came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves, and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, in 1876, Colorado {{became a}} state. At the time {{settlement}} had pushed as far west from its capital, Denver, as Leadville. There was {{a variety of}} metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains, and some miners had become rich from their claims there. Those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> so successful heard about reports from prospectors of abundant silver deposits further west, over the Divide.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{attacks the}} house where Breed is staying with the children, and incapacitates the mercenary, leaving him for dead. He {{establishes}} that the children are being used as drug mules to smuggle raw heroin into the country and locates Solomon Adeka, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> killed in Africa, but {{been turned into a}} heroin addict in order to control him. Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though this}} {{campaign}} is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, {{it was one of}} the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> defeated this decisively before. The women who defeated the Egyptians at Diros have been given the name of 'The Amazons of Diros'. This was the last invasion of Mani as Ibrahim abandoned any ideas of conquering it. On the April 26, 1827 the Turkish navy bombarded Oitylo with over 1,700 cannonballs hitting the town.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted McKean's version of events, {{arguing that the}} famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776. In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> present in Congress on July 4. According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2. Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 Stanford was {{appointed}} {{professor of music}} at Cambridge in succession to Sir George Macfarren who died in October of that year. Up to this time, the university had awarded music degrees to candidates <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> undergraduates at Cambridge; all that was required was to pass the university's music examinations. Stanford was determined to end the practice, and after six years he persuaded the university authorities to agree. Three years' study at the university became a prerequisite for sitting the bachelor of music examinations.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war {{came as a surprise}} to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
5|$|On November 7, Ralston {{called a}} meeting with company and union leaders to begin {{negotiations}} to resolve the strike. The temporary solution was that all workers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> involved in violence could return to work, the company would raise wages by five percent, recognize the union, guarantee a minimum weekly salary, and Thorpe and national union leaders would immediately leave the state. The union and company agreed to later submit all grievances to the Indiana Public Service Commission for arbitration, and agreed that their decisions would be final. The arrangement was submitted to a workers' vote and was approved unanimously; the strike ended at 6:00 pm.|$|E

5|$|The British {{casualties}} were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but {{a member of}} Howe's staff wrote in his diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded. David McCullough gives much higher figures of 90 killed and 300 wounded. The Americans had about 30 killed and 100 wounded, including Knowlton and Major Andrew Leitch among the dead. The American victory raised morale in the ranks, even among those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> engaged. It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington's command.|$|E
5|$|As the British destroyers {{completed}} their second attack, {{they were engaged}} by three more German destroyers. The British destroyers attempted to withdraw to the west, but were pursued by the German ships. Two additional German destroyers crossed the T of the British ships and quickly knocked out Hardys forward guns. More hits to the ship's bridge and superstructure set her on fire, mortally wounded Captain Warburton-Lee and killed or wounded {{all of the other}} officers on the bridge except Paymaster Lieutenant G.H. Stanning, the Captain's Secretary. Although badly wounded, he took command and after several more hits disabled her boilers ordered her run aground at Vidrek. The First Lieutenant, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> present on the bridge, assumed command and ordered the ship abandoned. Some of the crew delayed doing so until the last torpedo was fruitlessly fired at a German ship and No. 4 gun fired until it was out of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand it over to someone <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before its}} closure, there was {{interest}} in retaining the canal for its amenity value. The Stroudwater Canal Society, which {{later became the}} Cotswold Canals Trust, was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £82 million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase {{has so far been}} funded in this way, when a grant of £11.9 million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.|$|E
5|$|Polonium was {{administered}} to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients' ages ranged from 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, {{but at the time}} polonium-210 was the most readily available polonium isotope. The DoE factsheet submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state of alert, and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due to the darkness. Within minutes of landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced {{to try to reach}} their Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At the end of the raid those commandos <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> killed all became prisoners of war. Only five of the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|The battalion's {{casualties}} in Greece and Crete were heavy {{and by the}} end of the campaign it had essentially been destroyed. The fighting in Greece resulted in eight dead and seven wounded, as well as 65 captured, while a further 27 were killed in action on Crete, and one was killed in an accident. A further 70 were wounded and 433 were taken prisoner. Instead of being disbanded, the unit was rebuilt from a small cadre of personnel <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> sent to Crete (about 50 men) along with a large number of reinforcements, and the 16 personnel who had escaped Crete. This was undertaken in Palestine under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn, before the 2/7th was sent to Syria to perform occupation duties as part of the garrison that had been established there following the conclusion of the Syria–Lebanon campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} Dutch attacks led Sudirman, {{perhaps at}} the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser– who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|The convoys {{of wounded}} were met {{a few miles}} from El Arish by {{infantry}} with sandcarts lent by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, so the wounded who had endured the cacolets travelled in comfort to the receiving station, arriving at 04:00 on 25 December. The 52nd (Lowland) Division supplied medical stores and personnel to assist, but although arrangements were made for evacuation to the railhead two days later, evacuation by sea was planned. This had to be postponed due to a gale with rain and hail on 27 December and it was not until 29 December that the largest single ambulance convoy organised in the campaign, 77 sandcarts, nine sledges and a number of cacolet camels, moved out in three lines along the beach with 150 wounded. A few serious cases, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> ready to be moved, were evacuated the following day to begin their journey to Kantara on the Suez Canal.|$|E
