5|$|The story {{describes}} the romantic relationship between Annis Wychwood, a wealthy spinster, and Oliver Carleton, a rake who cares little for society's opinion of him. The two meet while jointly supervising Carleton's ward, Lucilla. Heyer granted her heroine {{a level of}} independence that was rare in Regency times and rare for Heyer's novels. Although the hero's personality {{is similar to that}} of many of Heyer's other heroes, in a departure from romance novel convention he experienced little personal growth in the novel; his primary change was to accept that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife.|$|E
5|$|Pearl {{returns to}} her {{penthouse}} apartment. She is visited by Captain Steel, {{who says he has}} been thinking about her recently and regrets their breakup. When he says that he still loves her and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relationship with her again, Pearl declines. The next night, she goes to a nightclub with Olivia and Jennifer. They have fun joking about the fortunes, and Pearl admits she is a little sad hers did not come true. Pearl goes to a coffee house and cries when the fortune's deadline passes without anyone talking to her. Friday morning, Pearl is leaving for work when she meets a man who is about to knock on her door. He says he works at the coffee house she visited, and that she left her wallet behind. After a conversation, Pearl and the man arrange a date.|$|E
25|$|Newspaper reports {{mention that}} Chang dealt {{exclusively}} with young women. One of his methods {{was to have}} a waiter pass a note to pretty girls in his restaurants saying that he admired them and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> quiet dinner with them sometime. Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers. His easy manners, charisma and exotic appeal meant {{that he was able to}} build up a large female clientele that was close to a fan club. In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so that the parties were invisible to each other.|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of scheduling and schedule co-ordination have conflicting objectives related to user’s cost, operator’s cost, overloading and crew deployment hours. Passengers <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> bus service {{where there is}} less waiting time.

500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature.

I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator Peter McConnell. McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band {{to tie in}} with the licensed music in the game. Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other [...] "real" [...] drums (6 tracks) were played by Y drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was {{not sure if it}} would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack. Schafer helped to select three songs—"We Are The Road Crew" [...] by Motörhead, [...] "The Metal" [...] by Tenacious D, and [...] "More Than Meets The Eye" [...] by Testament—to appear in a pack of Rock Band downloadable songs that was made available the same day as Brütal Legends release.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} design of Darth Vader's costume did not originally include a helmet. The idea that Vader should wear a breathing apparatus was first proposed by concept artist Ralph McQuarrie during preproduction discussions for Star Wars with George Lucas in 1975. In {{an interview with}} Star Wars Insider Magazine, McQuarrie stated that Lucas's artistic direction was to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with Samurai armour. [...] "For Darth Vader, George [...] just said he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind." [...] McQuarrie noted that the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed {{to survive in the}} vacuum of space, and he proposed that Vader should wear some sort of space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie combined a full-face breathing mask with a Samurai helmet, thus creating one of the most iconic designs of space fantasy cinema. McQuarrie's [...] of Darth Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller (a character prototype for Luke Skywalker) depicts Vader wearing black armour, a flowing cape and an elongated, skull-like mask and helmet. Its similarity to the final design of Vader's costume demonstrates that McQuarrie's earliest conception of Vader was so successful that very little needed to be changed for production.|$|E
