5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm is over, is part of the problem. In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E

5|$|Beginning around September10, heavy {{rainfall}} occurred sporadically in southern Mexico and into Central America, {{influenced by a}} broader storm system related to Hurricane Floyd. Toward the end of September, {{heavy rainfall}} occurred {{in the mountains of}} northeastern Mexico, which prompted officials to open flood gates. The rains occurred throughout Mexico for about two weeks before the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitation began, and saturated soils before the heaviest rainfall in October.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{damage from the}} hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas {{where there was no}} protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E
5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E

30|$|Our results {{challenge}} <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> {{studies that}} claim that time spent travelling {{is considered to}} be <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. Considering travel time as <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day implies that individuals only endure it. This is a very normative vision of travel time because it is possible to carry out many activities during a journey and also because travel time is not perceived in this negative way by intensive travellers.|$|R
5|$|In 1854, {{the town}} gained borough status and had its first mayor. In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11,000 {{inhabitants}} and {{was dominated by}} the defence industry, making it a target of German raids during World War II. The <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bombing was in 1940 and continued until 1942. During that time 107 high explosive bombs fell on the town. 49 people died, 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2,377 damaged.|$|E
5|$|On April29, 1963, {{less than}} half a year after Karen, Typhoon Olive caused {{extensive}} damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands. With many residents living in tents, and debris from the storm still scattered about, severe damage was anticipated. Schools, churches, and other structures were opened as shelters in order to protect those without homes. Ultimately, Guam was spared the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm though much of Saipan was devastated. The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with destructive winds for 36hours. Though weaker than Karen, the longer lasting impact of Pamela was regarded as more destructive.|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, winds {{from the}} {{precursor}} extratropical storm produced moderate damage, primarily to {{power lines and}} marine interests. Over 2/3 of the island's power subscribers were left without power during the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, and several boats sank or ran aground from the high winds. Damage on Bermuda totaled to over $1.4million (2001USD; $1.7million 2008USD). In Atlantic Canada, Tropical Storm Karen produced light winds and rain, but caused minimal damage.|$|E
