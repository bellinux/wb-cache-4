5|$|In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven {{was both}} a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are {{widespread}} among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible {{and it is an}} aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in place.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, Emerald was one {{of several}} vessels sent to hunt down and capture the {{crippled}} Santisima Trinidad, which had escaped from the British at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Emerald <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's squadron during the Action of 7 April 1800 off Cadiz.|$|E
50|$|According <b>to</b> legend, gold <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> once <b>been</b> mined on the Geißstein and Venetians or Venediger - a German {{term for}} foreign mineral prospectors - <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here.

5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built ashore for evaluation, {{but it was not}} completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E
5|$|The manga was {{licensed}} for English-language distribution by ADV Manga, which released five volumes between 2005 and 2007.

At New York Comic Con 2009, Yen Press announced that it had acquired the North American license for the series; it reprinted the first five volumes with new translations along with volume six in September 2009, and is continuing with later volumes.|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used at his factory.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade had a {{secondary}} objective of capturing Le Muy. It <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> assaulted by the 4th Parachute Battalion with the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion providing fire support. With the forces {{he had at}} hand, Pritchard was unable {{to carry out the}} task. The objective was then given to the 550th Glider Infantry Battalion, which had arrived with the second wave of aircraft. At 02:15 16 August the American battalion moved through the British positions and assaulted the village. The village was defended in strength by the Germans and the attack failed, causing several casualties to the Americans. A second attempt at 11:40 was more successful, killing or wounding 300 Germans and taking 700 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} French diversionary operations during 1806 was by a force that {{had been sent to}} sea in October 1805 as a diversion during the Trafalgar campaign, which by then was almost over. Sailing from Lorient to West Africa, L'Hermite <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reinforced by a squadron under Jérôme Bonaparte and attack and capture British forts on the West African coast, thus forcing the detachment of British forces from the main campaign in pursuit. The events {{of the end of the}} Trafalgar campaign cancelled these plans, and the scheduled reinforcements were instead attached to Willaumez's squadron. Despite this setback, L'Hermite continued with elements of the original plan and attacked British merchant ships and slave ships off West Africa during the spring of 1806, inflicting some local damage but failing to capture a trading post or to affect the wider strategic situation. In June, L'Hermite sailed to Cayenne for supplies and then returned to Europe the following month, encountering part of the British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis on his return and losing the frigate Président.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks after}} D-Day, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the German Army was in turmoil. While the Allied Army experienced great difficulty in {{breaking through the}} German lines (the city of Caen <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> captured {{on the first day}} of the invasion and was not taken until late in July) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was expending irreplaceable resources. The Allied air forces controlled the skies (up to 100km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing Axis troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive were in the midst of destroying the German Army Group Centre. In France, the German Army had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the 20 July plot—in which officers of the German Army, including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little trust between Hitler and his generals.|$|E

5|$|What Bouton {{described}} {{is likely}} to remain a mystery, but various theories have been proposed. In 1906, Tommaso Salvadori noted that the Martinique macaw seemed similar to the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) of mainland South America, and may have been the same bird. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. Edwards' Dodo, a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw, which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue, but the origin of this macaw is unknown. Another macaw in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis). Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow macaw, as does a mid-1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique macaw specimen, which <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a hoax, combining a burrowing parakeet (Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni) with the tail of a dove.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, {{while it was still}} dark, the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. The aim was to force the defenders out of their trenches and back into the sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day all the available Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. This was something they had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2014, McGary {{signed with}} the Thunder and joined them for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On the first {{possession}} of his first NBA Summer League game, McGary issued a halfcourt pass for a lob slam dunk by Jeremy Lamb, highlighting the passing that he is known for. On October 8 during training camp, McGary fractured the second metatarsal of his left foot, causing him to be sidelined for an estimated six weeks. This occurred {{three weeks before the}} team's October 29 season opener and meant McGary was expected to miss the first 14 games of the season. After missing the first 14 games, he began to be a limited participant in practices. McGary debuted with the Thunder on December 14 with 4 rebounds and 3 points in 7:15 of play against the Phoenix Suns. Subsequently, McGary was sidelined for 23 weeks with periostitis (inflammation) in his left tibia. He returned from injury on February 2 as he appeared in just his second NBA game in a 104-97 win over the Orlando Magic. On February 8, in his third NBA game, McGary posted a double double with 19 points and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers, while energizing the crowd and team. Then on February 9, he posted a 17-point, 10-rebound double double against the Denver Nuggets. He was one of the finalists for NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month. On March 13, McGary made his first start against the Minnesota Timberwolves in place of an injured Serge Ibaka, scoring 12 points in 22 minutes. At power forward, his defensive assignment <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Kevin Garnett, but Garnett sat out a third consecutive game and was replaced by fellow rookie (and former Michigan State rival) Adreian Payne who had replaced Garnett in the two previous games as well. McGary had made his first college basketball start against Payne's 2012–13 Michigan State team. On March 16, McGary established a new career high by nabbing 11 rebounds in his first 6 minutes of play before going on to post a double double with 13 rebounds and 12 points in 17 minutes against Dallas Mavericks. In the April 15 season finale against the Minnesota Timberwolves, McGary posted a season-high 4 blocked shots in just 14:54 of play. During his rookie and sophomore seasons, he had multiple assignments with Oklahoma City Blue, the Thunder's D-League affiliate.|$|E

5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E
