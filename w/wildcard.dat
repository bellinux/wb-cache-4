Four artists, one in each semifinal, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules.

5|$|All {{seventeen}} UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited {{and were}} obliged to attend the race. In January 2015, five UCI Professional Continental teams were given <b>wildcard</b> places into the race by the race organisers– Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) – to complete the 22-team peloton. Among the <b>wildcard</b> teams was , the first African trade team {{to participate in the}} Tour. As each team was entitled to enter nine riders, the peloton on the first stage consisted of 198 riders. These came from 32 countries. 41 riders – approximately a fifth of the peloton – were French; no other nation had more than 20 riders in the race. Merhawi Kudus and Daniel Teklehaimanot were the first ever Eritrean riders to participate in the Tour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Wildcards</b> extend Java {{generics}} by softening {{the mismatch}} between subtype and parametric polymorphism. Although {{they are a}} key part of the Java 5. 0 programming language, a type system including <b>wildcards</b> has never been proven type sound. <b>Wildcards</b> have previously been formalised as existential types. In this paper we extend FGJ, a featherweight formalisation of Java with generics, with existential types. We prove that this calculus, ∃J, is type sound, and illustrate how it models <b>wildcards</b> in the Java Programming Language. ∃J is not a full model for Java <b>wildcards,</b> because it does not support lower bounds for <b>wildcards.</b> We discuss why ∃J can not be easily extended with lower bounds, and how full Java <b>wildcards</b> could be modelled in a type sound way. ...|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{matching}} with <b>wildcards</b> is {{the problem}} of finding all factors of a text t of length n that match a pattern x of length m, where <b>wildcards</b> (characters that match everything) may be present. In this paper we present a number of fast average-case algorithms for pattern matching where <b>wildcards</b> are restricted to either the pattern or the text, however, the results are easily adapted to the case where <b>wildcards</b> are allowed in both. We analyse the average-case complexity of these algorithms and show the first non-trivial time bounds. These are the first results on the average-case complexity of pattern matching with <b>wildcards</b> which, as a by product, provide with first provable separation in complexity between exact pattern matching and pattern matching with <b>wildcards</b> in the word RAM model...|$|R

Chuang and Mirza continued their march into the semifinal defeating second seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual. They were joined by Kuznetsova and Mauresmo, Anna-Lena Grönefeld and Patty Schnyder, and Květa Peschke and Lisa Raymond, the only seeded team left in the draw.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wildcards</b> {{have become}} an {{important}} part of Java’s type system since their introduction 7 years ago. Yet there are still many open problems with Java’s <b>wildcards.</b> For example, there are no known sound and complete algorithms for subtyping (and consequently type checking) Java <b>wildcards,</b> and in fact subtyping is suspected to be undecidable because <b>wildcards</b> are a form of bounded exis-tential types. Furthermore, some Java types with <b>wildcards</b> have no joins, making inference of type arguments for generic methods par-ticularly difficult. Although there has been progress on these fronts, we have identified significant shortcomings of {{the current state of the}} art, along with new problems that have not been addressed. In this paper, we illustrate how these shortcomings reflect the subtle complexity of the problem domain, and then present major improvements to the current algorithms for <b>wildcards</b> by making slight restrictions on the usage of <b>wildcards.</b> Our survey of existing Java programs suggests that realistic code should already satisfy our restrictions without any modifications. We present a simple al-gorithm for subtyping which is both sound and complete with our restrictions, an algorithm for lazily joining types with <b>wildcards</b> which addresses some of the shortcomings of prior work, and tech-niques for improving the Java type system as a whole. Lastly, we describe various extensions to <b>wildcards</b> that would be compatible with our algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Wildcards</b> are {{a complex}} and subtle part of the Java type system, present since version 5. 0. Although there have been various formalisations and partial type {{soundness}} results concerning <b>wildcards,</b> {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no system that includes all the key aspects of Java <b>wildcards</b> has been proven type sound. This paper establishes that Java <b>wildcards</b> are type sound. We describe a new formal model based on explicit existential types whose pack and unpack operations are handled implicitly, and prove it type sound. Moreover, we specify a translation from a subset of Java to our formal model, and discuss how several interesting aspects of the Java type system are handled. ...|$|R
40|$|Java {{introduced}} <b>wildcards</b> years ago. <b>Wildcards</b> {{were very}} expressive, {{and they were}} integral to updating the existing libraries {{to make use of}} generics. Unfortunately, <b>wildcards</b> were also complex and verbose, making them hard and inconvenient for programmers to adopt. Overall, while an impressive feature, <b>wildcards</b> are generally considered to be a failure. As such, many languages adopted a more restricted feature for generics, namely declaration-site variance, because designers believed its simplicity {{would make it easier for}} programmers to adopt. Indeed, declaration-site variance has been quite successful. However, it is also completely unhelpful for many designs, including many of those in the Java SDK. So, we have designed mixed-site variance, a careful combination of definition-site and use-site variance that avoids the failings of <b>wildcards.</b> We have been working with JetBrains to put this into practice by incorporating it into the design of their upcoming language, Kotlin. Here we exposit our design, our rationale, and our experiences. 1...|$|R
