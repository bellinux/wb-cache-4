30|$|As aforementioned, the DINDs in the R+iSpace {{should be}} {{mounted on the}} MoMos for their {{automatic}} rearrangement. In addition, the DIND’s rearranging method should be satisfied aforementioned necessary conditions. A <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> robot is a good solution for the satisfaction of first and second conditions. To satisfy the remaining conditions, the mechanical structure of a MoMo is very important. There are various adhesion methods for conventional <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> robots: suction force, sticky materials, magnetic force, a mechanical combination, etc. Figure  2 shows examples of conventional <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> robots that employ the aforementioned adhesion methods.|$|R

40|$|Broadly speaking, the <b>climbing</b> <b>wall</b> {{is divided}} into two: Climbing Natural and Artificial Climbing. Artificial Climbing {{identical}} with Sport Climbing or Climbing Achievement commandeered By FPTI (Indonesian Rock Climbing Federation). Since rock climbing is a high-risk activity {{that is necessary to}} conduct research on the safety standards of rock climbing. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyzeimplementation of safety standards and the use of rock <b>climbing</b> <b>equipment</b> to improve safety work in the sport climbing activities (Studies in Central Java FPTI). This study includes a descriptive study using observational methods to approach in-depth interviews and surveys, the data collection information and compare it with the standards prescribed. The subjects of this study were climbers in which the lead climber, speed climbers, and boulder climbers. The object of this study is the use of Safety Standards and rock <b>climbing</b> <b>equipment</b> owned by FPTI Central Java.

The thesis is divided into two parts. The first chapter describes the topic of consumer behavior, including marketing research. The second chapter is focused on the situation in the Czech market with <b>climbing</b> <b>equipment,</b> also describes different kinds of this equipment and the major retailers selling these products in the Czech Republic. In the final part of this chapter will be presented my own marketing research of consumer preferences in this market, which was performed through a questionnaire survey. Based on the information gained in this survey I will recommend specific steps that can sellers take to improve relations with customers...|$|R

40|$|Electroadhesion {{technique}} {{being employed}} in variety of fields {{of science and}} technology is considered as a clamping technique for <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> robots. The focus of this research is to present a cost effective and light weight unipolar electroadhesion pad technology for <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> robots (WCR) capable of lifting a reasonable weight vertically. The literature demonstrates that most of the research related electroadhesion has been performed on bipolar electrode pads. The research presented in this paper indicates that unipolar electroadhesion pad showed favourable attachment on melamine and wood substrates giving encouragement for the realisation of unipolar WCR. Design considerations along with the attachment of anti-peeling tail are also considered for the realization of WCR. The controlling mechanism for unipolar <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> robot was not complex. In conculsion, unipolar electroadhesion pad of copper and aluminium is a feasible technique to develop a cost effective and light weight unipolar <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> robot...|$|R
