50|$|<b>Wreck</b> <b>removal</b> {{focuses on}} the removal of {{hazardous}} or unsightly wrecks that {{have little or no}} salvage value. Because the objectives here are not to save the vessel, the wrecks are usually refloated or removed by the cheapest and most practical method possible. In many cases, hazardous materials must be removed prior to disposing of the wreck. The most common techniques used in <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> are cutting the hull into easily handled sections or refloating the vessel and scuttling it in deeper waters.|$|R

40|$|The Nairobi International Convention on the <b>Removal</b> of <b>Wrecks</b> {{came into}} {{force on the}} 14 of April 2015 and {{provides}} a framework for <b>wreck</b> <b>removal.</b> Three central questions arise when dealing with shipwrecks; Who is responsible? What measures can and are to be taken based on such a responsibility? And lastly; how can the responsibility be enforced? The Nairobi Convention on the <b>Removal</b> of <b>Wrecks</b> addresses these questions. The registered owner of a ship bears strict liability according to the convention but can be exonerated by certain limited defenses. Measures {{that are to be}} taken include locating, marking and subsequently removing the wreck. The onus to remove the wreck is on the registered owner, but there are also options available for the State affected by the wreck should the registered owner not cooperate or be unable to contact. Finally the convention strives to ensure enforceability by compulsory insurance for ships, wherever registered, with a gross tonnage of 300 tons and above calling any port or offshore facility in a State Party. The convention also enables an Affected State to claim the insurer directly. This article will analyze the convention by the use of the convention text, its preparatory works and legal writing. The article suggests that even though the convention provides a unified framework for <b>wreck</b> <b>removal,</b> it has inclusions that may actually inhibit harmonization. The convention is also in part unclear and ambiguous. Despite this the article concludes in the convention being a natural step forward in unifying the regulation of wrecks and providing a platform to deal with <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> in the future...|$|R

The problem of localization of moving objects with an alternating magnetic field was transformed into the localization with a static magnetic field. The Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm was applied to calculate the position of the target with magnetic field data measured by a single three-component magnetic sensor.

40|$|Of {{concern to}} a number of states are wrecks, {{particularly}} those from the two World Wars, which pose a pollution or navigation hazard but which also have historic or broader cultural value.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{environmental}} monitoring of the Concordia <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> project, measurements of currents, winds and sea level height were made along the eastern coast of the Giglio Island, Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), during 2012 – 2013. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effect of atmospheric forcing and periodic sea-level changes on the coastal currents. Normalised Cross-Correlation Function analysis allowed us to correlate these observations. A marked inter-seasonal variability was found in both current and local wind velocity observations but a significant level of correlation between the data was only found during strong wind events. Current and wind directions appeared to be uncorrelated and current measurements showed a predominant NW–SE direction, presumably linked to the shape and orientation of Giglio Island itself. During strong winds from the SSE, current flow was towards the NNW but it suddenly switched from the NNW to the SE at the end of wind events. The results show that, at Giglio Island, currents are principally dominated by the general cyclonic Tyrrhenian circulation, and, secondly, by strong wind events. The sea level had no effects on the current regime...|$|R

In the 19th century, shipowners banded together in mutual underwriting clubs known as Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&I), to insure the remaining one-quarter liability amongst themselves. These Clubs are still in existence today and have become the model for other specialized and noncommercial marine and non-marine mutuals, for example in relation to oil pollution and nuclear risks. Clubs work {{on the basis of}} agreeing to accept a shipowner as a member and levying an initial [...] "call" [...] (premium).

40|$|This {{volume is}} the fifth {{in a series of}} six related {{publications}} that make up the U. S. Navy Salvage Manual. Each volume in the family addresses a particular aspect of salvage. The family collectively replaces the three volumes of the U. S. Navy Salvage Manual issued between 1968 and 1973. The increasing importance of preventing pollution at sea, and the fact that major oil spills often result from ship casualties, has made spill prevention and response a specialized adjunct to ship salvage. Having accepted responsibility for a casualty, salvors are expected to endeavor to stop or reduce spillage in progress, to conduct salvage in a manner that minimizes the risk of further spillage, and to respond to spills that occur as a result of salvage work. Additionally, ship salvage or <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> may be conducted separately to limit or prevent pollution.

40|$|A complex {{framework}} of chemical, biological and oceanographic activities was immediately activated after the Costa Concordia shipwreck, to assess possible contamination {{events and the}} environmental impact during both emergency and <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> operations. In the present paper, we describe the results obtained with caged mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, chosen as bioindicator organisms to detect variations of bioavailability and the early onset of molecular and cellular effects (biomarkers). Seven translocation experiments were carried out {{during the first year}} from the incident, with organisms deployed at 2 depths in 3 different sites. After 4 - 6 weeks, tissue concentrations were measured for the main classes of potentially released chemicals (trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile and aliphatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, halogenated pesticides, organotin compounds, brominated flame retardants, anionic surfactants); a wide battery of biomarkers covered responses indicative of exposure, detoxification, oxidative stress, cell damage and genotoxic effects. Results excluded serious contamination events or a consistent increase of environmental pollution although some episodic spills with reversible effects were detected. Data were elaborated within a quantitative weight of evidence (WOE) model which provided synthetic hazard indices for each typology of data, before their overall integration in an environmental risk index, which generally ranged from slight to moderate. The proposed WOE model was confirmed a useful tool to summarize large datasets of complex data in integrative indices, and to simplify the interpretation for stakeholders and decision makers, thus supporting a more comprehensive process of "site-oriented" management decisions...|$|R
40|$|Australia has a {{significant}} private rental market with {{over a quarter of}} households renting their home from a private landlord. Many of these households are on low incomes and receive assistance from private rental support programs provided by each Australian state and territory. In spite of these large numbers, {{little is known about the}} effectiveness of policy initiatives to assist low-income private renters. Limited knowledge of the private rental support programs stands in stark contrast to the detailed research on programs established to address homelessness and problems within the public housing sector. This paper addresses this lacuna by reporting on the suite of initiatives currently funded by state governments to assist low-income households (for example, bond loans and rental deposits, advice and help with <b>removal</b> <b>expenses).</b> Based on a comprehensive study of Private Rental Support Programs (PRSPs) commissioned by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, it is argued that though policies to assist vulnerable tenants are acknowledged as a success by practitioners and clients, their effectiveness as a policy instrument is undermined by wider structural changes in the housing market. The paper concludes that the stress faced by many vulnerable households is likely to intensify over the coming years thereby compounding the pressure on state Housing Authorities to provide more comprehensive packages of support that extend beyond just a &# 039;one-off&# 039; form of assistance...|$|R
40|$|Highway {{agencies}} often face winter operation expenses {{beyond what}} is budgeted due to fluctuations in the severity of winter weather. These agencies always are interested in finding a hedge against the cost of extreme weather {{in order to reduce}} the volatility of future snow <b>removal</b> <b>expenses</b> and thereby ensure a relatively more predictable cash flow. A viable method for agencies to accomplish this is purchasing snowfall options, which guarantee a certain payment to the buyer if the seasonal snowfall exceeds a predefined strike level. Specifically, if the actual total snowfall exceeds the strike level, the seller of the option will pay the buyer, in this case the highway agencies, an amount commensurate to the difference of the two levels. This payoff amount will help the agency fund the additional cost of winter operations in those years; but it is crucial that the agency measure the benefits of purchasing snowfall options against the associated costs. There are very few exchange-traded and standardized snowfall options; rather, the majority is customized for over-the-counter trading, which calls for extensive analysis to help the buyer to effectively negotiate with the seller. This dissertation proposes a framework that could be used by a highway agency at the state or local level to price their snowfall options to mitigate the risk of exposure to severe winter weather. The framework includes a model that forecasts the cost of snow removal and a two-step stochastic weather forecast model that combines stochastic frequency modeling with magnitude modeling to forecast the total snowfall during a season. Finally, the framework demonstrates the use of three different methods to price snowfall options in the context of a highway agency 2 ̆ 7 s winter maintenance operations. The different pricing methods proposed would enable both buyers and sellers to price customized snowfall options to hedge against severe winter weather. ...|$|R
