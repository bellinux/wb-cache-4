500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ <b>We</b> <b>wear</b> our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coker {{said that}} [...] "one {{of the things}} that's really the {{cornerstone}} of 90s hip-hop is sampling, {{so we have a}} lot of influences that <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> openly", which he compared to the style of Quentin Tarantino. He continued, [...] "I think what makes it feel new is the fact that we’re showing you can be both. We’re showing that you can do Ralph Ellison at the same times as you’re doing Chester Himes." [...] Coker was as specific with his choices of music in the season as [...] "Martin Scorsese is with the rock 'n' roll references like in Casino or in Goodfellas", rather than just adding hip-hop music for the sake of it. He highlighted the use of [...] "I'm Bad Like Jesse James" [...] in the seventh episode, which he had been trying to use in something for 20 years, that [...] "builds up and coincides with the explosion that happens on screen and it’s so subtle. That’s the kind of stuff I geek out over." ...|$|E
6000|$|But we are {{pressed by}} heavy laws; [...] And often glad no more, [...] <b>We</b> <b>wear</b> a face of joy, because [...] We have been glad of yore.|$|E

6000|$|He was, through boyhood's {{storm and}} shower, [...] My best, my nearest friend; [...] <b>We</b> <b>wore</b> one hat, smoked one cigar, [...] One {{standing}} at each end.|$|R
60|$|Emp. Sure, of all ills, {{domestic}} are the worst; When most secure of blessings, we are curst. When we lay next {{us what we}} hold most dear, Like Hercules, envenomed shirts <b>we</b> <b>wear,</b> And cleaving mischiefs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{said the}} colonel, eyeing {{him with a}} certain sardonic approval, [...] "I should suggest that henceforward <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> green coats, instead of black. One never knows what {{mistakes}} may arise when one looks so like a waiter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it not honour {{enough for}} the {{mechanical}} hinds that <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> their stuffs,' said Countess Jaqueline, 'without demeaning ourselves to eat at their boards? The outrecuidance of the rogues in the Netherlands would be surpassing, did we feed it in that sort.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Drills in hall, and drills outdoors, [...] And drills {{of every}} type, [...] Till <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> our boots with forming fours, [...] And our coats with [...] "Shoulder hipe!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Maréchal-Le Pen {{believes}} that Muslims {{can only be}} French if they follow the Christianity-shaped culture, saying that [...] "In our country, <b>we</b> don’t <b>wear</b> djellaba clothing, <b>we</b> don’t <b>wear</b> a veil and we don’t impose cathedral-sized mosques".|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{talked to}} me ould non-coms--they was sober--an' betune me an' thim <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> the draf' over into their tents at the proper time. The little orf'cer bhoy he comes round, decint an' civil-spoken as might be.|$|R
6000|$|... (Why hatters all are mad, I cannot say. [...] 'T {{were wrong}} in their affliction to revile 'em, [...] But truly, you'll confess 'tis very sad [...] <b>We</b> <b>wear</b> the ugly things they make. Begad, [...] They'd be less mischievous in an asylum!) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The phaeton at four,--so sweet in a {{beautiful}} white gown,--going to tea, and Sancho and all the baby things invited. Can't <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> our Sunday frocks? A splendid new net for Lita. And she likes dolls. Goody, goody, won't it be fun!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Edward Moseley--honorable sir," [...] {{said the}} steward, {{beginning}} to grow alarmed, [...] "if I {{may be so}} bold, you young gentlemen may like gay clothes; but as for me and his honor; {{we are used to}} such as <b>we</b> <b>wear,</b> and what we are used to we love." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We were {{reacting}} {{very strongly}} against the machismo, terrace chants and revisionism of Britpop, and the nationalism that we interpreted as xenophobia {{of the musical}} kind. We {{were trying to make}} a strong political statement about the fluidity of sexuality with the dresses and make-up that <b>we</b> <b>wore.</b> <b>We</b> set out to confuse, and I guess Nancy Boy was the perfect soundtrack to that." ...|$|R
60|$|But it is a swift horse indeed and a skilful rider who {{can hope}} to escape from Violette with Etienne Gerard in the saddle. He rode well, this young Russian, and his mount was a good one, but {{gradually}} <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> him down.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} the wind is going to hold," [...] the skipper said, looking astern. [...] "I reckon that it will drop, as it {{generally}} does, at sunset. It is not blowing so hard now as it did just before <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> round." ...|$|R
6000|$|I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of {{an average}} [...] unending procession, [...] Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all {{boundary}} lines, [...] Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth, [...] The blossoms <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> in our hats the growth of thousands of years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, madam, I do {{not judge}} any one else: {{but why should}} this poor {{perishing}} flesh be put into a picture? <b>We</b> <b>wear</b> it but for a little while, and are blessed when we are rid of its burden. Why wish to keep a copy of what we long to be delivered from?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{are just}} the same to persons with a handle to their name as to those without it. <b>We</b> <b>wear</b> a {{moderate}} modicum of crinoline, (3)and are never limp (4) in the morning. We have good and abundant dinners on CHINA though we have plate (5), and just as good when alone as with company.|$|E
60|$|DORA. I'm {{not sure}} about the making; for the <b>wearing,</b> <b>we</b> can all <b>wear</b> them--out, before anybody expects it.|$|R

6000|$|... "We look finer birds than we {{did when}} we rode in with brother Philip," [...] Beorn laughed when they had attired {{themselves}} in their new garments. [...] "The more sober of these suits are a good deal gayer than those <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> at home even at court ceremonies." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Eustace whistled softly. [...] "I {{am sorry}} if I {{offended}} you, old fellow," [...] he said. [...] "I {{had no idea}} that it was still a sore point with you. You must be a faithful people in South Africa. Here the 'holy feelings of the heart' are shorter lived. <b>We</b> <b>wear</b> out several generations of them in twelve years." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nay, {{the wonders}} {{were at their}} tongues' end even when lessons began, and put their farthings in great peril; and when they had nothing else to wonder at, they {{wondered}} {{when it would be}} twelve o'clock, and took no pains to swallow enormous yawns. Once, over her copy, Elizabeth exclaimed, [...] "Now! yes, this is necessary, Miss Fosbrook! May not <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> our white frocks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Monsieur Chauvelin," [...] added Marguerite, looking almost with {{defiance}} {{across at}} the placid, sphinx-like {{face of the}} Frenchman, [...] "His Royal Highness should add that we ladies {{think of him as}} of a hero of old [...] . we worship him [...] . <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> his badge [...] . we tremble for him when he is in danger, and exult with him in the hour of his victory." ...|$|E

5000|$|She {{started writing}} songs at {{fourteen}} and has memories {{of being in}} a folk music duo with a friend: [...] "I played flute, she played guitar and sang, and <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> matching paisley dresses that went to the floor, and played at coffee houses where people drank hot chocolates with marshmallows." ...|$|R
60|$|We dress far too heavily. The fact is, that {{we would}} be a much {{healthier}} people if <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> less clothing. Ladies especially wrap themselves up too much, with the result that their blood does not circulate freely. Coats, ulsters, and other wraps, cause far more colds than they prevent.|$|R
6000|$|Very {{fast and}} smooth we fly, [...] Spirits, though the flesh be by; [...] All looks feed {{not from the}} eye [...] Nor all {{hearings}} from the ear: [...] We can hearken and espy [...] Without either, we can journey [...] Bold and gay as knight to tourney, [...] And, though <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> no visor down [...] To dark our countenance, the foe [...] Shall never chafe us as we go.|$|E
6000|$|... "But be {{sure that}} you do not let them know you are bound for Helium as they are at war with that country. My {{assistant}} and I are of no country, we belong to all Barsoom and this talisman which <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> protects us in all lands, even among the green men--though we do not trust ourselves to their hands if we can avoid it," [...] he added.|$|E
60|$|This morning vest, or robe, call {{it as you}} please, {{was more}} shaped to the body than <b>we</b> <b>wear</b> them since, showing the body in its true shape, and perhaps a little too plainly {{if it had been}} to be worn where any men were to come; but among {{ourselves}} it was well enough, especially for hot weather; the colour was green, figured, and the stuff a French damask, very rich.|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{have been}} friends since the time <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> short frocks, and that implies a good deal,” she said. “Now, {{it is a little}} more {{difficult}} to deceive me than the rest—and I have been concerned about you lately. I wonder if I dare ask you if you have quite forgiven Tony?” ...|$|R
60|$|I saw his {{companion}} crawling slowly to his feet, {{and the others}} of the party racing down upon me. There {{was no time to}} argue now, other than with the weapons <b>we</b> <b>wore,</b> and so, as the fellow lunged at me again with the wicked-looking knife, I covered his heart and pulled the trigger.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shore will. Reckon I ain't a-goin' {{to need a}} pack-train. We {{saved the}} clothes <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> in here. Jane never thought it no use. But I figgered we might need them some day. They won't be stylish, but I reckon they'll do better 'n these skins. An' there's an old coat thet was Venters's." ...|$|R
