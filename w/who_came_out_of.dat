25|$|The Miramichi River valley, {{received}} a significant Irish immigration {{in the years}} before the potato famine. These settlers tended to be better off and better educated than the later arrivals, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> desperation. Though coming after the Scottish and the French Acadians, they made their way in this new land, intermarrying with the Catholic Highland Scots, and to a lesser extent, with the Acadians. Some, like Martin Cranney, held elective office and became the natural leaders of their augmented Irish community after the arrival of the famine immigrants. The early Irish came to the Miramichi because it was easy to get to with lumber ships stopping in Ireland before returning to Chatham and Newcastle, and because it provided economic opportunities, especially in the lumber industry. They were commonly Irish speakers, and in the eighteen thirties and eighteen forties there were many Irish-speaking communities along the New Brunswick and Maine frontier.|$|E
25|$|In the {{remaining}} provinces, killings continued throughout May and June, although they became increasingly low-key and sporadic; most Tutsi were already dead, and {{the interim government}} wished {{to rein in the}} growing anarchy and engage the population in fighting the RPF. On 23 June, around 2,500 soldiers entered southwestern Rwanda as part of the French-led United Nations Operation Turquoise. This was intended as a humanitarian mission, but the soldiers were not able to save significant numbers of lives. The genocidal authorities were overtly welcoming of the French, displaying the French flag on their own vehicles, but slaughtering Tutsi <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hiding seeking protection. In July, the RPF completed their conquest of the country, {{with the exception of the}} zone occupied by Operation Turquoise. The RPF took Kigali on 4 July, and Gisenyi and the rest of the northwest on 18 July. The genocide was over, but as had occurred in Kibungo, the Hutu population fled en masse across the border, this time into Zaire, with Bagosora and the other leaders accompanying them.|$|E

2500|$|Interpreting [...] and [...] the Gemara noted {{a dispute}} over whether the land of Israel was apportioned {{according}} to those <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt or according to those who went into the land of Israel. It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Josiah said that the land of Israel was apportioned according to those <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt, as [...] says, [...] "according to {{the names of the}} tribes of their fathers they shall inherit." [...] The Gemara asked what then to make of [...] which says, [...] "Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance." [...] The Gemara proposed that [...] "unto these" [...] meant adults, to the exclusion of minors. But Rabbi Jonathan taught that the land was apportioned according to those who entered the land, for [...] says, [...] "Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance." [...] The Gemara posited that according to this view, [...] taught that the manner of inheritance of the land of Israel differed from all other modes of inheritance in the world. For in all other modes of inheritance in the world, the living inherit from the dead, but in this case, the dead inherited from the living. Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar taught a third view — that the land was divided both according to those who left Egypt and also according to those who entered the land of Israel, so as to carry out both verses. The Gemara explained that according to this view, one among those <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt received a share among those <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt, and one who entered the land of Israel received a share among those who entered the land.
