40|$|This thesis {{proposed}} and demonstrated a new all-polymer based fabrication process for an all-polymer flexible and parallel optical interconnect cable having a vertical light coupler, {{which can not}} only cut down the cost by eliminating metallization process for alignment but also facilitate both in production and application. Throughout the process, polyimide {{was used as the}} substrate, coated by Epoclad as claddings, then AP 2210 B and WPR 5100 were used to fabricate waveguides and 45 degree mirror couplers, respectively. In addition, precisely aligned mirror couplers to waveguides are fabricated by using polymer-based, non-metallic, and transparent alignment marks. Conventional and metallic alignment marks are easy to be detected by camera, when a layer of high reflective material, generally Cr metal, is patterned. However, transparent polymer material is used in this process, as alignment marks made of it which are actually buried phase structures. Therefore, it is hardly to be observed by conventional microscopy system. Hence, to increase the contrast of the alignment marks, I {{proposed and}} tested a feature specific alignment camera system for which the shape and depth of the alignment marks are optimized for phase-based imaging, such as phase contrast and Schlieren imaging. The results showed a contrast enhancement of alignment marks image compared to that of a conventional microscopy system. By using the fabrication and alignment process, process for adding waveguides to the structure is identified by using the polymer based alignment marks on the WPR 5100 layer.

40|$|The {{impurities}} {{incorporated in}} the electrodeposited 40 nm Cu lines {{as well as in}} blanket Cu films were studied. Two different levelers were used in the study. While the impurity in the blanket films were found highly dependent on the leveler and its concentration, the leveler had no impact on the impurity in the narrow lines. Furthermore, the concentrations of suppressor and chloride showed little to no impact on the impurity in the narrow lines. An increase of accelerator concentration resulted in higher S and Cl contents in the lines. The increase in S incorporation was also observed for blanket <b>wafers</b> <b>plated</b> with incremental concentrations of accelerator. In addition, the impurity in the narrow lines was also found to increase with the increase of the applied plating current density. A correlation between a slow Cu grain growth and high impurity content was established by using Cu blanket films plated with different leveler concentrations or Cu films ion-implanted with different doses of impurities. © The Author(s) 2014.

Since silicon is a nominally brittle material, cutting of complex shapes remains a critical topic to study. Laser cutting represents a promising alternative. It does not involve any mechanical cutting force and tool wear. Moreover, thanks to the small spot diameter, laser cutting allows to realize very small and complex shapes too. However, during laser cutting, different kinds of defects can be generated depending on the beam-material interaction phenomena (ablation, melting and brittle cracking).

Even if the current baseline design fulfills the required effective area of 2 m 2 at 1 keV on-axis, alternative design solutions, e. g., privileging {{the field of view}} or the off-axis angular resolution, are also possible. Moreover, the stringent requirement of a 5 arcsec HEW angular resolution at 1 keV entails very small profile errors and excellent surface smoothness, as well as a precise alignment of the 1000 mirror modules to avoid imaging degradation and effective area loss.

Electrical measurements on dense, bilayer superstructures, including crossbars, random networks, and aligned arrays on networks of SWNTs reveal some important characteristics of representative systems. These and other layouts of SWNTs might find applications not only in electronics but also in areas such as optoelectronics, sensors, nanomechanical systems, and microfluidics. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) might represent an interesting semiconductor material for electronic applica-tions, as suggested by the high current-carrying capacities, ideal subthreshold behavior, and high-field effect mobilities in single tube devices. 1 - 3 Although devices of this type can be used to achieve representative demonstrations in electron-ics, optoelectronics, sensing and other areas, their integratio...|$|R
30|$|SEM {{images were}} taken from FEI NanoSEM at 1 kv, spot 4 or 10 kv, spot 3. TEM images of SWNTs {{were taken from}} Si 3 N 4 window where the {{nanotube}} grew in situ using a Philips CM 200 TEM at 200 kV. AFM images were recorded at NanoScope IIIa atomic force microscope from Veeco, Inc. in tapping mode at room temperature. Raman spectra of SWNTs on either silicon <b>wafers</b> or quartz <b>plates</b> were collected from JY-T 64000 Raman spectroscopy under ambient conditions by using excitation laser lines of 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) or 632.8 nm (1.96 eV) from an air-cooled Ar+ laser. The beam size is 2 µm. The laser power was carefully controlled to avoid any heating effects.|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{describe}} the concepts and results of electroless plating techniques on silicon wafers for two different applications: electroless bumping, and electroless plating for VLSI circuits. Flip chip technology requires the formation of bumps on semiconductor devices. Traditional bumping methods need expensive equipment for sputtering, photolithography and electroplating or evaporating. In contrast to the common techniques, the cost for a maskless wet-chemical bumping process is significantly lower. A chemical bumping technology developed and implemented at TUB/IZM is presented. The maskless process is based on electroless nickel deposition. Batches of 25 wafers of 150 mm diameter can be processed in a 30 l tank. The process time {{is determined by the}} nickel plating, which has a rate of 20 mu m/hour. The bump uniformity is better than 1 mu m for 20 mu m bumps on 100 mm <b>wafers.</b> For <b>plating</b> of very fine metal patterns such as contact holes and interconnections, we have developed a process based on electroless copper. The mechanical properties of copper deposits and the kinetics of electroless copper plating were analyzed for various types of baths. Selective copper plating introduces some new problems in general, such as compatibility with integrated circuit materials. There are also some particular problems that are associated with the technique, which are described here...|$|R
