[...] He called the operation [...] "the turning point" [...] in the invasion.

500|$|The Communist Party of the Russian Federation {{called for}} {{a ban on the}} film, accusing the {{production}} team of [...] "demonizing" [...] the Soviet Union. A party official said: [...] "In 1957 the USSR was not sending terrorists to America but sending the Sputnik satellite into space!" [...] Spielberg responded: [...] "When we decided the fourth installment would take place in 1957, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to make the Russians the enemies. World War II had just ended and the Cold War had begun. The U.S. didn't have any other enemies at the time."

I love you, bye." [...] Shortly after, an announcement was made through the speakers confirming the show was cancelled. According to local newspapers Milenio and El Universal, fans screamed [...] "Fraud!", booed and hurled chairs and other items. Two days later, a statement was released by Spears that said: [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't finish the show for my fans. The Mexican fans {{are one of the}} best audiences to play for.

His troops reportedly rounded up the Cherokee and held them in rat-infested stockades with little food. Private John G. Burnett later wrote, [...] "Future generations will read and condemn the act and I do hope posterity will remember that private soldiers like myself, and like the four Cherokees who were forced by General Scott to shoot an Indian Chief and his children, had to execute the orders of our superiors. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> in the matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} Oregon, Parrish saw devastated forests {{managed by the}} Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and decided to protest a local timber sale. With two neighbors, she and Richard {{established}} an organization called [...] "Threatened and Endangered: Little Applegate Valley" [...] (TELAV). They worked for two years researching and writing a 600-page legal-and- scientifically-based protest of BLM's logging of forests which would not regenerate, which was illegal. The BLM assistant state director eventually agreed, telling the Medford Mail Tribune that …"The sale involves enough improprieties in BLM rules and procedures that it can’t be legally awarded. In order to comply with our own procedures <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to withdraw the sale and reject all bids." [...] The TELAV protest document served {{as the basis for}} many future timber sale protests in the U.S. and Canada. [...] TELAV continues to fight for the environment to this day and the Little Applegate Valley has never been logged.|$|E

60|$|Only {{those who}} have {{had to deal with}} Italian {{officials}} can imagine how our patience was tried by every one with whom we came in contact. We were bandied about from one authority to the other, were stared at, cross-questioned, mystified--not in the least because the case presented any special difficulties or intricacies, but because it was absolutely necessary that every civil dignitary to whom we applied should assert his own importance by leading us to our object in the most roundabout manner possible. After our first day's experience of official life in Italy, I left the absurd formalities, which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to perform, to be accomplished by Alfred alone, and applied myself to the really serious question of how the remains in the convent outhouse were to be safely removed.|$|E
60|$|This left {{us about}} sixteen hundred able-bodied men or {{many more than}} we could employ with effect in that narrow place. Therefore we {{determined}} to act upon a plan which we had already designed in case such an emergency as ours should arise. About three hundred and fifty of the best men were to remain to defend the temple till all were slain. The rest, {{to the number of}} over a thousand, were to withdraw through the second court and the gates beyond to the camp of the women and children. These they were to conduct by secret paths that were known to them to where the camels were kraaled, and mounting as many as possible of them on the camels to fly whither they could. Our hope was that the victorious Black Kendah would be too exhausted to follow them across the plain to the distant mountains. It was a dreadful determination, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E

6000|$|The {{rest of us}} {{were grouped}} at the port anchor davit, staring with no less assiduity, but with far less hope on the obscure horizon. Islands we beheld in plenty, but they were of [...] "such stuff as dreams are made on," [...] and {{vanished}} at a wink, only to appear in other places; and by and by not only islands, but refulgent and revolving lights began to stud the darkness; light-houses of the mind or of the wearied optic nerve, solemnly shining and winking as we passed. At length the mate himself despaired, scrambled on board again from his unrestful perch, and announced that we had missed our destination. He was the only man of practice in these waters, our sole pilot, shipped for that end at Tai-o-hae. If he declared we had missed Takaroa, {{it was not for}} us to quarrel with the fact, but, if we could, to explain it. We had certainly run down our southing. Our canted wake upon the sea and our somewhat drunken-looking course upon the chart both testified with no less certainty to an impetuous westward current. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to conclude we were again set down to leeward; and the best we could do was to bring the Casco to the wind, keep a good watch, and expect morning.|$|E
60|$|A nation {{which has}} made the professions that England has, does not with impunity, under however great provocation, betake itself to {{frustrating}} the objects for which it has been calling {{on the rest of}} the world to make sacrifices of what they think their interest. At present all the nations of Europe have sympathized with us; have acknowledged that we were injured, and declared with rare unanimity, that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to resist, if necessary, by arms. But the consequences of such a war would soon have buried its causes in oblivion. When the new Confederate States, made an independent Power by English help, had begun their crusade to carry negro slavery from the Potomac to Cape Horn; who would then have remembered that England raised up this scourge to humanity not for the evil's sake, but because somebody had offered an insult to her flag? Or even if unforgotten, who would then have felt that such a grievance was a sufficient palliation of the crime? Every reader of a newspaper, to the farthest ends of the earth, would have believed and remembered one thing only--that at the critical juncture which was to decide whether slavery should blaze up afresh with increased vigor or be trodden out at the moment of conflict between the good and the evil spirit--at the dawn of a hope that the demon might now at last be chained and flung into the pit, England stepped in, and, for the sake of cotton, made Satan victorious.|$|E
60|$|That day Decimus Saxon left us, {{intending}} {{to make a}} round {{of the country and}} to deliver his letters, but promising to be back again ere long. We had a small mishap ere he went, for as we were talking of his journey my brother Hosea must needs start playing with my father's powder-flask, which in some way went off with a sudden fluff, spattering the walls with fragments of metal. So unexpected and loud was the explosion, that both my father and I sprang to our feet; but Saxon, whose back was turned to my brother, sat four-square in his chair without a glance behind him or a shade of change in his rugged face. As luck would have it, no one was injured, not even Hosea, but the incident made me think more highly of our new acquaintance. As he started off down the village street, his long stringy figure and strange gnarled visage, with my father's silver-braided hat cocked over his eye, attracted rather more attention than I cared to see, considering the importance of the missives which he bore, and the certainty of their discovery should he be arrested as a masterless man. Fortunately, however, the curiosity of the country folk did but lead them to cluster round their doors and windows, staring open-eyed, while he, pleased at the attention which he excited, strode along with his head in the air and a cudgel of mine twirling in his hand. He had left golden opinions behind him. My father's good wishes had been won by his piety and by the sacrifices which he claimed to have made for the faith. My mother he had taught how wimples are worn amongst the Serbs, and had also demonstrated to her a new method of curing marigolds in use in some parts of Lithuania. For myself, I confess that I retained a vague distrust of the man, and was determined to avoid putting faith in him more than was needful. At present, however, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> hut to treat him as an ambassador from friends.|$|E
