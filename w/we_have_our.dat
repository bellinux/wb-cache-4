In 2000, she launched an online portal, Cineexplore for the production company. She explained, [...] "The portal takes into account every aspect of film-making. My role {{is that of a}} supervisor. I just have to overlook the proceedings. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> hands in everything. We are making software for TV and music videos." [...] She, however, clarified that she wasn't involved in the production aspect of the company, but participated in supervising and [...] "overseeing everything".

Passengers and crew began making phone calls to officials and family members starting at 09:30 using GTE airphones and mobile phones. Altogether, the passengers and crew made 35 airphone calls and two cell phone calls from the flight. Ten passengers and two crew members were able to connect, providing information to family, friends, and others on the ground.|$|E
500|$|While {{many critics}} found the band's new sound refreshing, NME criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely using their {{trademark}} funk sound, asking: [...] "Can <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy {{is starting to}} make my removed rib tingle." [...] Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be [...] "the best big-time American rock guitarist going right now". Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the band as [...] "New Age fuck fiends" [...] and citing [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] and [...] "Purple Stain" [...] as highlights.|$|E

Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that {{once and for all}} that we [...] cannot carry on with our lives within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state. [...] For the sake of this ideal, we throw in the balance all of what <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>our</b> lives and fortunes, our women and children, our descendants' life and happiness.

500|$|Longstreet soon {{clashed with}} Bragg and became {{leader of the}} group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's {{subordinates}} had long been dissatisfied with his leadership and abrasive personality; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, added credibility to the earlier claims, and was a catalyst toward action. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, [...] "I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as long as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> present commander." [...] The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed {{was one of the most}} bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg [...] "was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight" [...] and that he [...] "knew nothing of the business." [...] Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict.|$|E

There {{is going to be}} a greatest hits album and we've got loads of new songs that nobody has heard yet." [...] On 28 June 2007, the group held a press conference at The O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite. During the conference, the group confirmed their intention to embark upon a worldwide concert tour, starting in Vancouver on 2 December 2007. [...] "I want to be a Spice Girl again. We are like sisters and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> arguments, but by the end of the day we get back together", said Emma Bunton, while Melanie Chisholm commented that the tour [...] "will be a proper good farewell to our fans". The group's comeback single, [...] "Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)", was announced as the official Children in Need charity single for 2007, and released on radio on 23 October, whilst released digitally on 5 November and commercially on 19 November 2007.|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, {{following}} its legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate {{for the rights}} to Superman, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that it planned to move ahead with its long-awaited Justice League film, uniting such DC Comics superheroes as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film. The release of Man of Steel in 2013 was intended to be {{the start of a new}} shared universe for DC, [...] "laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics." [...] In 2014, Warner Bros. announced that slate of films, similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance. That year, DC CCO Geoff Johns stated that the television series Arrow and The Flash were set in a separate universe from the new film one, later clarifying that [...] "We look at it as the multiverse. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world.

500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because it gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E
