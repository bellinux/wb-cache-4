5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, {{it can be argued}} that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E

5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|The play {{established}} Fielding as {{a popular}} London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> London theatre scene, in his view, abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres.

5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E

5|$|In 1075, Toirdelbach drove Gofraid {{from the}} kingship and Ireland itself. There is {{uncertainty}} concerning {{the circumstances of}} Gofraid's expulsion, and of Domnall's accession. On one hand, {{it is possible that}} Gofraid was involved in lending assistance to Anglo-Danish resistance against the Norman regime in the recently conquered Kingdom of England. If correct, Gofraid would appear to have been at odds with Toirdelbach, a monarch who appears to have cultivated close links with the Norman regime. Domnall, therefore, may have had Toirdelbach's consent to rule in Dublin as Gofraid's replacement. In fact, Toirdelbach's placement of Domnall in Dublin, and his allowance of the latter's aforesaid cousin in Leinster, may have been a <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Uí Briain exploited the fractured Uí Chennselaig. Certainly, Domnall's cooperation would have been a valuable asset to Toirdelbach, considering the prominence of his father amongst the Dubliners, and the likelihood that Domnall himself may have lived most of his life there. On the other hand, it is possible that Gofraid was driven from the kingship because he had aligned himself with the Leinstermen against the Uí Briain. If such a sequence of events is correct it could mean that, even though Gofraid was unable continue on with the revolt, it was his Uí Chennselaig confederates who succeeded in securing Dublin from the Uí Briain.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} to become the Metropolitan line of the London Passenger Transport Board's London Underground, including Quainton Road.

In 1935 the Brill Tramway was closed. From 1936 Underground trains were withdrawn north of Aylesbury, leaving the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GCR) as the only operator using the station, although Underground services were restored for a short period in the 1940s. In 1963 stopping passenger services were withdrawn but fast passenger trains continued to pass through. In 1966 the line was closed to passenger traffic and local goods trains ceased using the station. The line through the station was singled and used by occasional freight trains only.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had {{to ditch}} {{in a river}} because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight {{attendant}} and injuring dozens of passengers.

After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making {{it more difficult for}} hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|E
