5|$|Hybrids of {{the species}} are known in nature and cultivation. In the Whipstick forest near Bendigo in Victoria, {{putative}} hybrids with Whirrakee <b>wattle</b> (Acacia williamsonii) have been identified; these resemble hakea <b>wattle</b> (Acacia hakeoides). Garden hybrids with Queensland silver <b>wattle</b> (Acacia podalyriifolia) raised in Europe {{have been given the}} names Acacia x siebertiana and Acacia x deneufvillei.|$|E
5|$|Species {{similar in}} {{appearance}} include mountain hickory <b>wattle</b> (A. obliquinervia), coast golden <b>wattle</b> (A. leiophylla) and golden wreath <b>wattle</b> (A. saligna). Acacia obliquinervia has grey-green phyllodes, fewer flowers in its flower heads, and broader (-wide) seed pods. A. leiophylla has paler phyllodes. A. saligna has longer, narrower phyllodes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wattles</b> Estate, {{originally}} {{known as}} Jualita, {{is a historic}} house and park in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, California, United States. It was built in 1907 by wealthy Omaha, Nebraska, banker Gurdon <b>Wattles</b> as a winter home.Next to the <b>Wattles</b> Mansion,are <b>Wattles</b> Park, and <b>Wattles</b> Gardensnow administered by the City {{and open to the}} public..|$|R
50|$|The Fiji <b>wattled</b> honeyeater or {{northern}} <b>wattled</b> honeyeater (Foulehaio taviunensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. It was considered conspecific with the Polynesian <b>wattled</b> honeyeater and the kikau.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> crane was {{formerly}} placed {{in its own}} genus Bugeranus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus Grus within the crane family was not monophyletic and that the <b>wattled</b> crane was a sister species to a clade containing the blue crane and the demoiselle crane. In the resulting reorganization of the genera, the <b>wattled</b> crane {{was moved to the}} genus Grus. Some taxonomists retain the <b>wattled</b> crane within Bugeranus. The <b>wattled</b> crane is monotypic: there are no recognised subspecies.|$|R
5|$|In prehistoric Britain simple {{circular}} <b>wattle</b> and daub shelters {{were built}} wherever adequate clay was available.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Coat of Arms {{includes}} a wreath of wattle; this does not, however, accurately represent a golden <b>wattle.</b> Similarly, {{the green and}} gold colours used by Australian international sporting teams were inspired by the colours of wattles in general, rather than the golden <b>wattle</b> specifically.|$|E
5|$|The Conservancy {{has been}} {{involved}} with the Red <b>Wattle</b> hog since the 1980s. At that time, the breed had a thriving population, stock was registered by three different breed registries, and breeders resisted suggestions from the organization to create a unified breed registry. However, between 1990 and 1999, purebred stock diminished from 272 animals to just 42 pigs held by six breeders, and in 2000, it was asked to create a unified breed registry for the Red <b>Wattle</b> Hog. Three hogs were registered in the first year, but the next year 90 hogs and three breeders were represented and a breed association was created. By 2008, 111 breeding stock hogs had been registered and 56 breeders were part of the Red <b>Wattle</b> Hog Association.|$|E

50|$|Many {{species have}} <b>wattles</b> {{which can be}} small (black-headed, spot-breasted, red-wattled and banded lapwings) or large (white-headed plover, African <b>wattled,</b> yellow-wattled, southern, Andean, Javanese <b>wattled,</b> or masked lapwings). The latter species are {{the largest of the}} plover family, since several exceed 30 cm.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} {{infertile}} {{areas of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Hamersley would have supported open forests of Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah) with Corymbia calophylla (Marri) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala (Tuart), and an understorey of Banksia attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.menziesii (Firewood Banksia), B.grandis (Bull Banksia), Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak) and Agonis flexuosa (Swan River Peppermint). The main shrub species would have been Jacksonia sternbergiana (Stinkwood), J.furcellata (Grey Stinkwood), Acacia cyclops (Coastal <b>Wattle),</b> Acacia saligna (Orange <b>Wattle),</b> Hibbertia species, Allocasuarina humilis (Dwarf Sheoak), Calothamnus quadrifidus (One-sided Bottlebrush) and Grevillea thelemanniana (Spider Net Grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, Jacksonia sericea (Waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wattle</b> and daub {{is still}} found as the panels in timber-framed buildings. Generally {{the walls are}} not structural, and in {{interior}} use the technique {{in the developed world}} was replaced by lath and plaster, and then by gypsum wallboard.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are used}} as {{construction}} materials. Living cactus fences are employed as barricades. The woody parts of cacti, such as Cereus repandus and Echinopsis atacamensis, are used in buildings and in furniture. The frames of <b>wattle</b> and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of Carnegiea gigantea. The very fine spines and hairs (trichomes) of some cacti were used {{as a source of}} fiber for filling pillows and in weaving.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>Wattle</b> Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the <b>Wattle</b> Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5000|$|Dubbing is the {{procedure}} of removing the comb, <b>wattles</b> and sometimes earlobes of poultry. Removing the <b>wattles</b> {{is sometimes called}} [...] "dewattling".|$|R
50|$|In birds, <b>wattles</b> {{are often}} an {{ornament}} for courting potential mates. Large <b>wattles</b> are correlated with high testosterone levels, good nutrition {{and the ability}} to evade predators, which in turn indicates a potentially successful mate. It has also been proposed that ornamental organs such as <b>wattles</b> are associated with genes coding for disease resistance.|$|R
5000|$|Vegetation {{communities}} present include {{areas of}} eucalypt woodland with Austral grasstrees, coastal manna gums, drooping sheoaks, and the endangered Bellarine form of yellow gum. black sheoaks, black <b>wattles,</b> golden <b>wattles,</b> prickly hedge <b>wattles,</b> coast tea-trees and silver banksias are scattered through the reserve.

5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. <b>Wattle</b> and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the efforts of the organization, {{heritage}} turkey populations have increased more than tenfold in little over a decade, and several breeds that once stood on the brink of extinction now maintain healthy populations. The organization also sustains programs that deal with preserving and promoting endangered cattle and pig breeds, as well as breed-specific programs relating to many of its livestock categories. Breeds that the Conservancy has assisted in saving include the Carolina Marsh Tacky horse, Randall cattle, Red <b>Wattle</b> hogs and the American rabbit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided {{to examine a}} single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With the permission of the site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, they looked at the defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of <b>wattle</b> and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Ace Crosby (Mitchell Harris), {{an angry}} Arizona gambler, wants to shoot <b>Wattles</b> for {{representing}} {{his wife in}} a previous divorce case. Swift suggests that <b>Wattles</b> dress as a woman {{in order to avoid}} being found by the gambler. That evening, <b>Wattles</b> and Swift do the same thing that they do every evening: turn their office into a casino. Swift arrives at the casino pretending to be Aggie Bruno's love interest. To add to the confusion, <b>Wattles</b> (dressed as a woman) shows up with Joe Bruno, pretending to be his love interest.|$|R
5000|$|Gurdon Wallace <b>Wattles</b> was {{the third}} son of James <b>Wattles</b> and Elizabeth Ann [...] "Betsy" [...] Whitton. He was born on May 12, 1855 {{in the town of}} Richford, Tioga County, New York and died on January 31, 1932 at Hollywood, California. He was the {{grandson}} of Jehiel <b>Wattles</b> and Phoebe Lathrop; and Dr. Tower Whitton, a 1796 graduate of Dartmouth College.|$|R
50|$|One of four {{species of}} bellbird {{that live in}} Central and South America, the three-wattled bellbird is between 25 cm and 30 cm long. The body, tail, and wings of the male are uniformly chestnut-brown; its head, neck, and upper breast are white; {{and it has a}} black eye-ring, eye-stripe, and bill. Its name comes from the three {{worm-like}} <b>wattles</b> of skin that hang {{from the base of the}} bill. These <b>wattles</b> can be as long as 10 cm when extended during songs and interactions. The <b>wattles</b> remain flaccid even when extended. The male shakes the <b>wattles,</b> but otherwise they hang straight down; they are neither erectile nor under muscular control. The side <b>wattles</b> do not stick out to the sides and the central one is not extended directly skywards as shown on some old illustrations and specimens. The female bellbirds are smaller and less striking in appearance, being overall olive with yellowish streaking below, pure yellow vent and no <b>wattles.</b>|$|R
5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a <b>wattle</b> on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|Like other wattles, Acacia pycnantha fixes {{nitrogen}} {{from the}} atmosphere. It hosts bacteria known as rhizobia that form root nodules, where they make nitrogen available in organic form and thus help the plant grow in poor soils. A field study across Australia and South Africa {{found that the}} microbes are genetically diverse, belonging to various strains of the species Bradyrhizobium japonicum and genus Burkholderia in both countries. It is unclear whether the golden <b>wattle</b> was accompanied by the bacteria to the African continent or encountered new populations there.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the route}} {{began in the}} 1950s, but the first segment between <b>Wattle</b> Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980. Over the next five years, the highway was {{extended}} north to Great Eastern Highway and south to Albany Highway, and a discontinuous section was constructed north of the Swan River. In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections, and three years later, Reid Highway became the northern terminus. The next major works on the highway, between 2003 and 2005, extended the highway south to Thomas Road.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of congenital appendages (<b>wattles)</b> on {{the throat of}} goats {{is supposed to be}} under genetic control with a dominant mode of inheritance. <b>Wattles</b> contain a cartilaginous core covered with normal skin resembling early stages of extremities. To map the dominant caprine <b>wattles</b> (W) locus, we collected samples of 174 goats with <b>wattles</b> and 167 goats without <b>wattles</b> from nine different Swiss goat breeds. The samples were genotyped with the 53 k goat SNP chip for a subsequent genome-wide association study. We obtained a single strong association signal on chromosome 10 in a region containing functional candidate genes for limb development and outgrowth. We sequenced the whole genomes of an informative family trio containing an offspring without <b>wattles</b> and its heterozygous parents with <b>wattles.</b> In the associated goat chromosome 10 region, a total of 1055 SNPs and short indels perfectly co-segregate with the W allele. None of the variants were perfectly associated with the phenotype after analyzing the genome sequences of eight additional goats. We speculate that the causative mutation is located in one of the numerous gaps in the current version of the goat reference sequence and/or represents a larger structural variant which influences the expression of the FMN 1 and/or GREM 1 genes. Also, we cannot rule out possible genetic or allelic heterogeneity. Our genetic findings support earlier assumptions that <b>wattles</b> are rudimentary developed extremities...|$|R
50|$|Almost all <b>wattles</b> have {{cream to}} golden flowers. The small flowers are {{arranged}} in spherical to cylindrical inflorescences, with only the stamens prominent. <b>Wattles</b> have been extensively introduced into New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Gurdon <b>Wattles</b> was a noted Omaha {{business}} {{leader who}} was the organizer of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition in Omaha. The <b>Wattles</b> House was designed by Thomas Kimball, who was architect-in-chief for the Exposition. The <b>Wattles</b> house {{is one of the}} few examples of the Chateauesque style in Omaha. The house now contains several apartments and its outlying carriage house has been made into two apartments.|$|R
