50|$|A {{trail of}} green Psiren blood {{leads to the}} engine room. Lister and Cat stay behind {{to deal with a}} meteor shower, while Rimmer {{chickens}} out of helping Kryten, leaving him to follow the Psiren blood trail alone. When Kryten finds the Psiren it changes into Professor Mamet, his creator. With no choice but to obey her commands, he climbs into the <b>waste</b> <b>compactor</b> and starts it up. Lister, Cat and Rimmer quickly appear (the meteor shower being yet another illusion) to find Kryten's psi-scan and bazookoid abandoned on the floor. Rimmer suddenly fades out as the battery on his light bee runs flat. Now just the two of them, Lister and Cat walk up to the Psiren, which is disguised as a vending machine and knocks them unconscious. As the Psiren decides which to eat first, Kryten, now cube shaped from his experience in the <b>waste</b> <b>compactor,</b> waddles over {{to the edge of the}} walkway from the deck above and crashes down on top of it. The threat ended, the crew continues onward, following Red Dwarf into a vast nebula.|$|E

40|$|AbstractKolkata {{is one of}} {{oldest and}} largest {{metropolitan}} city in eastern part of India with population of 4, 486, 679 and population density of 24252 per km 2. The city of Kolkata generates almost 5500 ton of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day. The waste {{of the city is}} maintained by Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and around 80 % of this waste is collected by corporation waste management system KMC has introduced the Modern Scientific Waste Compacting Stations (MSWCS) under the Clean City initiative. The MSW thus collected were taken to the nearest compactor station which houses around two to five compactors depending upon the area, in total there are 90 compactors and 30 mobile compactors functioning till date. The number is expected to go up by the end of 2015 to 163 compactors at a cost of INR 152 crore. The previous method of dumping in open Vat was unhygienic and produced odor and vector born diseases in the vicinity and the people living near were largely affected. Though the addition of compactor has enhanced the cleanliness of the city but the sustainability of these waste compactors is a major issue and which is needed to be addressed. The disposal of the compacted waste is still being carried out in traditional landfill site and the landfill site and city distance being smaller raise a question on transportation savings which may have been incurred due to the compactor thus the payback period and long-term sustainability of the compactor is in question. The sustainability issues and challenges were identified based on a preliminary field study in 15 of the compactor station in Kolkata. The waste quantity, waste characteristics, number of trip of the compactors, labors requirements and number of other sustainability factors were evaluated. The data collected were benchmarked based on the literature, with the practices of other countries. The study reveals that there is number of issues which are lacking and needed to be implemented within the <b>waste</b> <b>compactor</b> management system to make the project sustainable in long run. The analysis revealed the need for a sanitized landfill site for methane extraction and segregation of waste before compacting for increasing the sustainability of the system. The studies finding if implemented can led to a more sustainable, economical and environmentally sound waste management system for the city of Kolkata. There are number of literature specific to waste management practices but specific study for <b>waste</b> <b>compactor</b> in a city and for Kolkata is unavailable in literature...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Increasing {{the volume}} of waste leads to an {{increase}} in waste collection, transportation and final removal costs. Also high percentage of humidity leads to the destruction of collection and transportation machines and to increasing the leachate produced in landfill site and polluting the soil and surface and underground water. So there are several attempts to solve these two problems. This study was to design and produce a unique bin which extracts, reduces and collects leachate from urban wastes and also reduces dry wastes volume. Methods: This applied study was conducted to design and produce an innovative indoor mechanical <b>waste</b> <b>compactor</b> {{for the first time in}} Shahroud University of Medical Sciences in Iran within 6 months of time and cost about 500 dollars. To test the effectiveness of the device, experiments (3 times) were performed using dry and wet wastes. After filling the tank with 18 liters of waste and triggering the force transmission crow (for moving compactor sheet) by a 30 - year- old, 60 -kilogram person, the humidity percentage and the volume before and after the compaction were measured. Results: This device is capable of making a notable decrease in volume of waste and separating waste humidity up to 45 percent of initial amount (in average). Repeating the experiment with dry waste also showed the capability of device up to 40 percent in waste volume (in average). Conclusion: This waste bin can extract, reduce and collect a lot of leachate from solid wastes and thus reduce its environmental impacts and remove problems of wastes collection proces...|$|E
40|$|The University of Massachusetts Amherst is {{committed}} to sustainability, however, the campus could further reduce its costs and save energy by optimizing the current method of waste removal. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts {{that by the end}} of the century, Earth’s average temperature will rise by 11 degrees Fahrenheit unless society takes action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to the EPA, about one-third of carbon emissions in the U. S. come from transportation. Campus garbage bins are collected by carbon-emitting trucks daily, and large truckable <b>waste</b> <b>compactors</b> are collected about three times per week. The amount of harmful carbon emissions released by trucking all of the compactors to their disposal sites totals 9, 600 pounds of CO 2 (the weight of 12 grand pianos) every week. In this analysis, the current waste removal system is investigated and a method is proposed to save UMass money and energy by reducing the number of waste collections. Initial research focused on how traditional bins could be replaced with solar-powered compactors from Bigbelly Solar Inc. to reduce pickup frequency and generate revenue from separating waste. Findings indicate that solar compactors alone would not have a worthwhile impact on the energy consumption of the UMass campus. Alternatively, a monitoring system that reduces how frequently <b>waste</b> <b>compactors</b> are hauled from campus would have greater impact, saving $ 1, 000 every two weeks, reducing harmful carbon emissions, and using less diesel fuel. Due to the current environmental crisis, UMass should take action to reduce its carbon footprint through this economically favorable system...|$|R

50|$|Tycoon - Leader: Skylar Banes, CEO. This faction is {{representative}} of the Global Trust, Earth's number one leading energy supplier in 2070. Tycoons like to exploit resources quickly for immediate use, which leads to workers that are richer and can pay more taxes. The economy of a Tycoon player accelerates early in the game and declines gradually near the end, as their non-renewable resources run out (Tech's technologies can mitigate this setback however). In turn, Tycoons decrease the eco balance and affect the environment negatively. Tycoons rely on coal and nuclear plants for power, and their citizens enjoy hamburgers, wine and spending time at the Casino. Tycoon citizens do not worry about negative eco balance as much as their Eco counterparts, but they can't gain benefits from positive eco balance. To increase eco balance, Tycoons can build, for example, CO2 reservoirs and <b>waste</b> <b>compactors.</b>|$|R

The tackled problem concerns the determination of an effective opportunistic maintenance policy in order to assure the required service performance levels at the minimum global maintenance cost. The problem is mathematically formulated by a constrained partition model that becomes difficult or very hard to solve by mathematical approach for large practical systems as that one here considered. For this reason, in order to solve the proposed problem of maintenance services optimisation, a genetic approach is developed...|$|R
40|$|Return of high {{nitrogen}} (N) content {{crop residues}} to soil, particularly in autumn, {{can result in}} environmental pollution resulting from gaseous and leaching losses of N. The EU Landfill Directive will require significant reductions in the amounts of biodegradable materials going to landfill. A field experiment {{was set up to}} examine the potential of using biodegradable waste materials to manipulate losses of N from high N crop residues in the soil. Leafy residues of sugar beet were co-incorporated into soil with materials of varying C:N ratios, including molasses, <b>compactor</b> <b>waste,</b> paper waste, green waste compost and cereal straw. The amendment materials were each incorporated to provide approximately 3. 7 t C per hectare. The most effective material for reducing nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production and leaching loss of NO 3 − was <b>compactor</b> <b>waste,</b> which is the final product from the recycling of cardboard. Adding molasses increased N 2 O and NO 3 − leaching losses. Six months following incorporation of residues, the double rate application of <b>compactor</b> <b>waste</b> decreased soil mineral N by 36 kg N per hectare, and the molasses increased soil mineral N by 47 kg N per hectare. <b>Compactor</b> <b>waste</b> reduced spring barley grain yield by 73 % in the first of years following incorporation, with smaller losses at the second harvest. At the first harvest, molasses and paper waste increased yields of spring barley by 20 and 10 % compared with sugar beet residues alone, and the enhanced yield persisted to the second harvest. The amounts of soil mineral N in the spring and subsequent yields of a first cereal crop were significantly correlated to the lignin and cellulose contents of the amendment materials. Yield was reduced by 0. 3 – 0. 4 t/ha for every 100 mg/g increase in cellulose or lignin content. In a second year, cereal yield was still reduced and related to the cellulose content of the amendment materials but with one quarter of the effect. Additional fertilizer applied to this second crop did not relieve this effect. Although amendment materials were promising as tools to reduce N losses, further work is needed to reduce the negative effects on subsequent crops which was not removed by applying 60 kg/ha of fertilizer N...|$|R
