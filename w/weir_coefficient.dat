40|$|An {{iterative}} step {{method for}} solving the non-linear ordinary differential equation, governing spatially varied flows with decreasing discharge, like the flow over side weirs, is developed. In the procedure, starting at a known flow depth and discharge {{in the control}} section, the analytical integration of the dynamic equation with bed and friction slope is carried out. The specific energy, the <b>weir</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the velocity distribution coefficient are considered as local variables, then for the explicit integration, the respective average values along the short side weir elements are assumed. The water surface profiles and the discharges for flow over side weirs, obtained with the proposed relation, valid for rectangular channels, are compared with experimental data for subcritical and supercritical flow conditions. The validation of the method is accomplished by the comparison with the solution obtained by De Marchi's classical hypothesis, about the specific energy, which is constant along a side weir.

40|$|The ten North Frisian Hallig {{islands are}} located in Schleswig-Holstein’s part of the UNESCO world {{heritage}} Wadden Sea. They are of worldwide uniqueness and strongly influenced by tides, wide systems of tidal inlets and the shallow relief of the sea bottom. One unique feature of these islands {{is the lack of}} dikes. For this reason the houses are built on artificial dwelling mounds {{in order to protect the}} inhabitants and their goods against frequently occurring inundations during storm surge seasons. Nevertheless, the Hallig islands themselves benefit by these inundations due to sediments, which are accumulated on the island’s surfaces. This sedimentation has enabled a natural adaption to sea level rise in the past. In times of climate change and an accelerated sea level rise it is not confident if this natural vertical marsh accretion can compensate the rise of average water levels as well as an acceleration of sea level rise. These ecologic and cultural characteristics are not the only reason for the great importance of the Hallig islands and the surrounding Wadden Sea. They also reduce wave loads on the sea dikes at the mainland in the east of the islands. Due to the geographic location and the isolation during extreme events special kinds of protection measures have been developed over the last centuries. The construction methods of these measures are mainly based on tradition and the knowledge of the inhabitants. However, no resilient design approaches and safety standards for these special structures like dwelling mounds and elevated revetments exist today and neither a cost efficient construction nor a prioritization of measures is possible. Main part of this thesis is the scientific investigation of the existing coastal protection measures with the objective of the development of design approaches and safety standards. Furthermore, the influence of different parameters on sedimentation on the island’s surfaces is analysed. New impulses for sustainable coastal protection measures and management strategies are given which simultaneously consider future climate conditions and the resulting loads. The inhabitants are directly involved in this process by stating their knowledge, experiences and ideas for future protection measures. To answer these research questions a numerical model is built to calculate the hydrodynamic loads in the area of the Hallig islands. The further investigations follow a typical profile through one of these islands. Beginning at the edge of a Hallig island, the hydraulic performance of the elevated revetments is tested in physical and numerical tests. The results are a <b>weir</b> <b>coefficient</b> and a coefficient for permeability as well as a design approach. This approach respects not only wave overtopping and flow through the structure but also erosion processes on the Hallig island surfaces. The investigations on the main surface areas of the islands show that simple measures can influence the vertical marsh accretion and a sustainable adaption to a rising sea level is possible. A resilient safety standard for artificial dwelling mounds is developed. It considers the location, geometry and hydrodynamic loads of the respective dwelling mound. This safety standard is applied and quantified for selected dwelling mounds. New impulses and ideas for future protection measures are generated during futureworkshops where the inhabitants can develop their own coastal protection concepts under scientific advisory. The following evaluation from the hydraulic engineering perspective guarantee hydrodynamic effective and social accepted measures. The results provide a scientific contribution to future sustainable coastal protection measures in the area of the North Frisian Wadden Sea. Furthermore, partial results also represent an extension of knowledge for other coastal areas...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for analysing the hydraulics of side channel spillways. Such structures {{consist of a}} weir discharging into a receiving channel whose longitudinal axis runs parallel {{to the length of}} the weir. This has a unique characteristic of producing spatially varied flow in the channel. Once passed the receiving channel the flow enters the exit channel for the steep descent to the stilling basin before resuming its original course. The thesis produces a mathematical model which removes the need to resort to an expensive physical model to analyse such structures thereby enhancing the quality of service to the Client. The mathematical model produces rating curves which not only describe the relationship between reservoir level and spillway flow but more fundamentally determines the magnitude of the design flood. It concentrates on the performance of the spillway when the overflow weir is subject to heavy submergence as a result of passing extreme floods stipulated by the Reservoirs Act 1975. Published data which defines the relationship between degree of submergence of a weir and the reduction in the <b>weir's</b> <b>coefficient</b> of discharge is used to match the water profile in the channel with that of the induced distribution of flow over the weir. The model identifies changes in the location of the governing hydraulic control section throughout the range of the rating curve. Commonly found associated features which might also affect the rating curve are also investigated, eg arch bridges, tapering channels. The results of the mathematical model are compared to those obtained from scale physical models commissioned by Rofe, Kennard and Lapworth as a result of reservoir inspections. At maximum reservoir levels, flows obtained from the mathematical model are within 8 % of those from the physical model. With the spillway passing the design flood the heads required over the weir by the mathematical model are within 15 % of those in the physical model...|$|R

This work focuses on experimental results, obtained at various physical hydraulic models. A visualization method is employed, which - {{in contrast to}} more common approaches - allows non-invasive quantification of velocity fields.

30|$|In this study, three {{different}} hybrid ANFIS methods, namely ANFIS-DE, ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO {{were used to}} evaluate the discharge coefficient of a modified triangular side weir. To evaluate the most appropriate hybrid ANFIS model, eight different input combinations were tested on the models. The first input combination consists of five simple input variables. By moving from the first input combination to the last, the number of variables decreases and their complexity increases. The results show that all of the considered methods performed significantly better when using the first input combination. Subsequently, the results of the three hybrid ANFIS models with the first input combination were compared with each other using standard deviation. According to the results, the difference between the training and testing errors in the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO models is very high and these models’ results are not reliable to use in practical situations. Finally, the results of the ANFIS-DE method with the first input combination of w/b, y 1 /b, L/b, sin(θ/ 2), and Fr 1 was compared with previous works by Borghei and Parvaneh (2011) and Emiroglu et al.

The diffusive tank model has been successfully applied in rainfall-runoff simulations in paddy fields because it can well describe the features of the local water flow. In most of the applications of this model, although the determination of the related model parameters is important, detailed investigations on each individual parameter are definitely needed to improve the accuracy of the results. In the study, an improved procedure is proposed to determine certain variables involved in the diffusive tank model and the application is conducted in a field area in Taiwan. In the application, the roughness of the river channel was assessed according to the actual field conditions. Instead of using the observed water levels in each rainfall event, the notch width of the rectangular contracted weir per unit area was evaluated by direct field measurements to calibrate the discharge coefficient. Test results from the selected field in six rainfall events showed that the local average value of the notch width of the rectangular contracted weir per unit area was 1. 025 m/ha.

One of the hydraulic advantagesof compound weirs is that atlowflow rate, the bottomnotchacts assimpleweir andwith the creation of morehydraulicheadonits upstream, due to theshape of thenotch, make dischargemeasurement withappropriatesensitivity. In high flow rates, the upper notch prevents of increasing upstream water level and backwater and discharge measurement is possible with acceptable accuracy. The compound sharp-crested weirs {{can be used as}} an appropriate solution for discharge measurement with reasonable accuracy and sensitivity of the extensive range of flows. Relations are derived from this kind of weirs hassufficientaccuracy withobservation of design criteriaandconstructionstandards. The purposeofthisresearch was a laboratory investigation of geometricandhydraulic effective parameterson discharge coefficient of compound arched circular- rectangular sharp-crested weirs in two cases of full width of channel and partially contracted weirs and compare the values of the discharge coefficient of compound and simple rectangular weirs. Materials and Methods:Considering the geometric, kinematic and dynamic variables affecting the free flow of sharp-crested weirs, there are 11 independent variableswiththree main quantities (length, massandtime). Usingdimensional analysis with π-Buckinghammethod,it can bederived thedimansionlessrelationship. In order to assess theeffect of various parametersonthe coefficient ofCd,thedimansionlessdiagramsare used. Inthe state of(h≤h 0), discharge relationship usedinsimplecircular weir. In thestate of(h>h 0), discharge of compound weir is computeted from the linear combination of discharge relationships in circular and rectangular weirs. Experimentsare conducted inthe hydraulic engineering models laboratory, Department of Water Engineering, University of Tabriz, in a rectangular glass-metal flume of 9 m length, 25 cm width and 50 cm height. Aftersetting up the weirs in a relevant place of flume andestablish thesteady flow,experiments were performedinthefree flowon 36 models of weirs. Results and Discussion:In this research, theeffects ofrectangularnotch width, the height of weir crest, the height ofcirculararch notch were investigated forchanges of headwithdimensionless ratios of h/P,h/R,h/h_ 0,h/Bon discharge coefficient. The results showthat fora known headover the <b>weir,</b> discharge <b>coefficient</b> increase about 2 to 10 percent with the development of the rectangular notch width of compound and simple rectangular sharp-crested weirs. For a given head over the <b>weir,</b> discharge <b>coefficient</b> decrease approximately 1 to 5 percent by increasing the height of the weir crest of compound and simple sharp-crested weirs. Fora given head over weir in low head values, discharge coefficient increase approximately 35 percent by reducing the height of circulararch notch in the compound weirs than simple rectangular weirs. Based on statistical indicators, computational and observation discharge coefficient values in most compound and simple weirs, acceptable coincidence with each other. The meanvalues of thecoefficient of determination (R 2) androot mean square error(RMSE) are 0. 630 and 0. 061,respectively.

The {{first part of the}} study considers the discharge characteristics of flow past a two-dimensional lateral slot located in a rectangular conduit. Existing theoretical solutions to this problem are based on free streamline theory. The test results provide data to verify the predictions of the theoretical model related to the dependence of the slot discharge coefficient on discharge ratios and the ratio of the kinetic energy to the total energy of the flow approaching the slot. The test results validate the model predictions. A theoretical expression for the outflow through a rectangular lateral weir located in a circular open channel is derived.

This study is based on an experimental program. Three cases of openings arrangements were included, one, two and three openings.

Also, decreasing (D/Z) leads to make the maximum velocity near the bed tends to be lifted upward. Moreover, Comparing weirs with different openings numbers but have the same openings area leads to that, weirs with one opening have a bigger (Cd) than weirs with two or three openings but the maximum velocity near the bed of the weir with three openings is less than that with one opening.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to understand the effects of breach properties (e. g. the top width, the depth and the bottom width of the breach) on the breach flow. The breach flow was modeled as flow over a compound broad-crested weir. A laboratory experiment was carried out with a fixed weir model in a flume. Five cases with different breach properties were tested. Firstly, the discharge coefficients for all cases were quantitatively determined. The calibrations were done under two flow conditions, namely emerged flow conditions (flow only through the breach) and overtopping flow conditions (flow through the compound cross-section of weir). In perfect weir situations, {{it turned out that the}} values of the discharge coefficient were below 1 and rather different in the two flow conditions. Particularly in the case of overtopping flow, the linear combination of traditional discharge equations was verified for predicting the discharge and the discharge distribution over the weir. In imperfect <b>weir</b> situations, submergence <b>coefficient</b> was introduced in emerged condition. Secondly, the dependence of the energy head loss caused by the weir on the upstream discharge and the downstream water depth was discussed in imperfect weir situations. The Form Drag model for estimating the energy head loss was proved to be applicable for the modeled breach flow. Thirdly, the local hydraulic characteristics of breach flow were described by means of velocity distribution, water level elevation and flow patterns appearing behind the weir. At last, the numerical model (Delft 3 D) was verified on the modeling of the present experiment by comparing with the experimental data. The report provides the information for the breach flow which can be of use in the development of breach models, inundation models and compound weir design.

40|$|Hydraulic {{structures}} {{are present in}} the designs of different Room for the River projects in the Netherlands. Examples are longitudinal weirs, groins, summer dikes and weirs in the inlet of a side channel. Morphological simulations with Delft 3 D are frequently carried out to investigate the effect of such projects on for example hindrance for shipping and dredging costs. It is important that also the physical processes around hydraulic {{structures are}} correctly modeled in these situations. At the upstream slope of a hydraulic structure, the larger depth-averaged velocity causes an increased sediment transport capacity and increased actual bed shear stresses. The latter is reinforced by a change of the velocity distribution over the vertical with respect to uniform flow. Opposite, the gravity component along the slope results in a higher critical bed shear stress than in flat bottom conditions. At steep slopes, (partial) bed-load transport blockage could occur. Delft 3 D is meant to model flow phenomena of which the horizontal length and time scales are significantly larger than the vertical scales. Near hydraulic structures, this is generally not the case. These structures are parameterized as weirs in a depth-averaged Delft 3 D model in engineering practice. The only effect of these weirs is an additional energy loss in the momentum equation. The parameterization aims at representing the influence of the weirs on the flow at larger scales. The local flow around the structures (including turbulence, vertical velocity components and actual shear stresses) is not correctly modeled. Moreover, there is no direct influence of the weir on sediment transport (like increased critical shear stresses and bed-load transport blockage). This inaccurate way of modeling could result in errors in the prediction of the morphological effects of hydraulic structures. The objectives of this study are: (1) Assessing the performance of the current way of Delft 3 D modeling of sediment transport around hydraulic structures in three-dimensional flows. (2) Making recommendations on the modeling of sediment transport around hydraulic structures in hydraulic engineering practice. The performance of Delft 3 D has been judged by comparing the results with the results of the numerical model FLUENT. FLUENT is an advanced flow modeling system, in which sediment transport can be studied by analyzing the trajectories of discrete particles. Firstly, some laboratory experiments describing flow and transport over structures have been modeled. In this way, the performance of both models has been investigated and mutually compared. The results of FLUENT gave confidence to use FLUENT as an instrument to judge the performance of Delft 3 D in modeling three-dimensional flow and transport over hydraulic structures. A three-dimensional flow situation has been designed, which resembles the flow over a longitudinal weir. In Delft 3 D, all bed-load transport and suspended-load transport that reaches the weir also passes the weir. In FLUENT, this is not the case. Suspended-load transport is distributed between the main channel and the zone behind the weir in the same ratio as the discharge. The distribution of bed-load transport strongly depends on the particle diameter. This difference shows that the parameterization of weirs in depth-averaged Delft 3 D models gives significant errors in the prediction of sediment transport over hydraulic structures, especially when bed-load transport is dominant. The transport magnitude can be reduced by increasing the bed level points near the weir to crest level. In this schematization, nearly all bed-load transport is blocked and suspended-load transport is reduced. A weir without increased bed level points overestimates the sediment transport over the structure. When the bed level points are increased until crest level of the weir, the sediment transport over the weir is underestimated. The sediment transport over the weir can be tuned by an increased bed level somewhere between zero and crest level. The distribution of sediment between the main channel (index 1) and the area behind the weir (index 2) can be described with a relation S 2 /S 1 = C*Q 2 /Q 1 : The value of C as given by Delft 3 D can be judged with the following rules of thumb: (1) Suspended-load transport is distributed between the main channel and the zone behind the weir in the same ratio as the discharge, so C = 1. (2) For bed-load transport in three-dimensional situations with clearly oblique flow over the <b>weir,</b> the <b>coefficient</b> C can be related to the excess shear stress at the upstream slope, in which the actual and critical Shields parameter are adjusted for slope effects. (3) In situations where the flow is directed almost perpendicular to the crest of the structure, the conclusions of Lauchlan (2001) are recommended. Nearly all mobile sediment is transported over the structure in these situations. The coefficient C in Delft 3 D can be influenced by giving the bed level points near the weir the right height.

40|$|Introduction: Labyrinth weirs {{compare with}} {{straight}} weirs had required less freeboard in upstream {{so they are}} more appropriate for the irrigation networks. So they could maked more space to sotrage water and restrained foold with higher discharge. Labyrinths weirs have three generally form triangles, trapezoidal and rectangular that Tullis et al. (15) presented formula (3) for discharge <b>coefficient</b> of labyrinth <b>weirs</b> (triangles and rectangular) and a few studiescarried out on rectangular shape and its hydraulic characteristics are not specified. Therefore main aim of this paper study and characterized hydraulic characteristics of rectangular labyrinth weirs by using laboratory data. Materials and Methods: In this study rectangular labyrinth <b>weir</b> discharge and <b>coefficient</b> discharge relationships used dimensional analysis and experiment on hydraulic modeling, constant coefficient was defined. Laboratory flume is shown in Figure 2 (0. 5 m wide x 12 m long x 0. 8 m deep). Models was made from clear plexiglass plate with 10 cm thickness thatcuted using leaserdevice and the crest manualy shaped quadrant with radius 10 cm, all models using silicon glue install in the flume. The upstream depth readership by point gauge that installed in upstream of models. Discharge calcutaed byupsterm depth of triangular weir that installed in down stream of flume. Data were analyzed by SPSS software and to compare relationships with each other used two parameter {{root mean square error}} and correlation coefficient and charts darw in Excel Results and Discussion: discharge coefficient formula (11) carried out by using SPSS software that compared with formula (3). Results showed (Tables 2 and 3) that the correlation coefficient of formula (11) was more than a formula (3) and formula (11) RSME was less than formula (3) RSME except in first and fifth hydraulic model (rectengular 1 and 5) that they were almost equal. So the formula (11) was more accurate than a formula (3) to peredict discharge of flow in flume. In previous step we used all data, we saw flourmloa (11) had more accurate then we diceded data divided in to three groups: high change, length change and all that calculated correlation coefficient and RSME for formula (11) to figure out which group have more accurate, results was brought in table 4. The result showed that constant coefficient of formula (11) yields from all data was useful for the design proposed. Plotted discharge changes against H/P for rectangular labyrinth and straight weirs in Figs. 3 and 4. In constant discharge and high with raising length weir, decreased depth of flow over the weir because the effective weir length was raised and the ratio of distributed length to apex length (b) was decreased. As well as in constant H/P and high weir with raising apex length, discharge was increased that similarity of the results of Tullis et al. (15) and Khode et al. (8). In length, and the ratio H / P constant with increasing height in the discharge coefficient due to submergence reduce local side Jt Hay reduce interference, but increases with increasing height from 0. 20 to 0. 25 m m discharge coefficient decreases as flow rate and Weber number decreased {{as a result of the}} effect of surface tension and increased resistance to flow. In length, and the ratio H / P fixed amount of overflow discharge increases with increasing height as the ratio H / P value of the denominator increases and therefore increases the total height of the water upstream. For designoverflow rectangular labyrinth weirs recommends 0. 20 ≤H/P≤ 0. 40 that maximum aeration and discharge coefficient in this range is the result of Hay and Taylor (7) and Darvas (4) is consistent. In discharge and fixed weir height and maximum height of the water upstream directly at least equal to 1. 8 of the overflow stright weirs. So for the areas where there is a height restriction of water upstream, the water level upstream of rectangular labyrinth weirs less direct overflow weirs requires the use of this is recommended. Conclusion: The results showed the relationship (11) that uses most of effective parameters has more accurate results and proposed for design aim. In constant water head upstream discharge of labyrinth weir maximum 2. 6 times more than straight weir discharge and in constant discharge water head upstream of straight weir 1. 8 times more than upstream labyrinth weir water head so use a labyrinth weir appropriate for areas that have head and discharge restrictions. Best range of ratio H/P for of design was 0. 20 to 0. 40 and maxim coefficient discharge happened in this range...|$|R
