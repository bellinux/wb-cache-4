2500|$|This {{species was}} {{formerly}} placed into the paraphyletic [...] "perching duck" [...] assemblage, but subsequently {{moved to the}} dabbling duck subfamily (Anatinae). Analysis of the mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes, however, indicates {{that it might be}} closer to the genus Aix and better placed in the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae. In addition, the other species of Cairina, the rare <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck</b> (C. scutulata), seems to belong to a distinct genus. The generic name Cairina, meanwhile, traces its origin to Aldrovandi, and ultimately to the mistaken belief that the birds came from Egypt: translated, the current scientific name of the Muscovy duck means [...] "the musky one from Cairo".|$|E

50|$|<b>White-winged</b> wood <b>duck</b> (Cairina scutulata), an {{endangered}} species of forest duck, and the sarus crane (Grus antigone) are native to the Shweli river. The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), a crocodilian, was last spotted in 1927. The Irrawaddy dolphin {{has been known to}} reach the upper tributaries of the Ayeyarwady including the Shweli.|$|R
50|$|Few of {{the major}} birds in Assam are: blue-throated barbet or hetuluka (Megalaima asiatica), the <b>white-winged</b> wood <b>duck</b> or deuhnah (Cairina scultulata), the ring-tailed fishing eagle or kuruwa (Haliaeetus leucorythus), the great pied {{hornbill}} or rajdhonesh (Buceros bicornis homrai), the Himalayan golden-backed three-toed wood-pecker or barhoituka (Dinopium shorii shorii), and the migratory pelicans.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss, small {{population}} size, and because this duck is hunted for eggs, pets and food, the <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck</b> is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. The <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck</b> {{is also found}} the central Sumatra province of Riau, specifically in the peatland acacia plantations of a large pulp and paper company. The plantations at least temporarily provide suitable habitat between periodic harvests (once every 4-5 years). The ducks are frequently observed along canals where large and overhanging Acacia trees provide shade and cover from predators and a haven in which to feed and rest. The quiet and still water in the canals of the plantations provides an undisturbed and secluded location, away from local communities which may hunt the ducks or collect eggs. Near-by natural forest conservation areas and greenbelts also provide suitable nesting and roosting habitat {{in close proximity to}} the canals.|$|E
50|$|A {{part of the}} Xe Khampho-Xe Pian Important Bird Area (IBA) {{overlaps}} the park. 750 km2 of the IBA's approximate area of 2000 km2 lies in Xe Pian. Bird {{species of}} important conservation status in the common IBA and park area include <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck,</b> masked finfoot and white-rumped vulture. Elsewhere in the park important species include giant ibis, sarus crane, red-headed vulture, woolly-necked stork and green peafowl.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the park}} is the largest {{breeding}} colony of milky storks in the world, {{and one of the}} largest colonies of lesser adjutant. Other threatened birds in the park include the Storm's stork, <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck,</b> Nordmann's greenshank and Far Eastern curlew. The total bird population of the park has been estimated to be up to one million, while during winter up to 100,000 migratory birds stop over for rest.|$|E

50|$|The {{district}} {{is rich in}} wildlife. Rare mammals such as Mishmi takin, red goral, elephant, wild water buffalo and leaf muntjac occur while among birds there is the rare Sclater's monal, Blyth's tragopan, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal florican, <b>white-winged</b> wood <b>duck.</b> A flying squirrel, new to science, i.e., Mishmi Hills giant flying squirrel (Petaurista mishmiensis) also occurs in this district.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of swamp forest and lowland rain forest, mostly of secondary growth as result of extensive logging in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite decreasing populations, the park {{still has a}} few critically endangered Sumatran tigers, Sumatran elephants and Sumatran rhinoceroses. It also provides excellent birdwatching, with the rare <b>white-winged</b> wood <b>duck</b> among the over 400 species present in the park.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} hundred {{species of birds}} to be found within the park area, but only {{preliminary}} research {{has been carried out}} so far. Of particular interest to conservationists is the <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck</b> (Cairina scutulata), which is endangered and one of the rarest waterfowl in Asia. There {{are a number of other}} threatened or near-threatened birds here too, like green peafowl (Pavo muticus), lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and grey-headed fish eagle (Icthyophaga icthyaetus).|$|E
50|$|Historically, the <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck</b> {{was widely}} {{distributed}} from north-east India and Bangladesh, through South East Asia to Java and Sumatra. It is extinct in Java. In India, the duck is {{found only in}} the northeastern {{part of the country}} with main concentration in eastern Assam and adjacent areas of Arunachal Pradesh. However, in 2002 it had a population of only 800, with about 200 in Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, 150 on Sumatra, notably in Way Kambas National Park and 450 in India, Bangladesh and Burma.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>duck</b> or white-winged {{wood duck}} (Asarcornis scutulata) {{is a large}} species of duck, {{formerly}} placed in the genus Cairina and allied with the dabbling ducks. However, mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence analysis and the biogeographical pattern of distribution indicate that the anatomical similarity to the Muscovy duck is deceiving. Thus, this species might more appropriately {{be placed in a}} monotypic genus, as Asarcornis scutulata, which appears to be unrelated to the Muscovy duck but closer to the diving ducks.|$|E
50|$|Bird species sighted in Thungyai include <b>white-winged</b> wood <b>duck</b> (Cairina scutulata), kalij {{pheasant}} (Lophura leucomelanos), grey peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus philippensis), Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala), greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius), red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), mountain hawk-eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis), lesser fish eagle (Ichthyophaga humilis) and all six species of hornbill (Bucerotidae) living in mainland Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} mangroves {{are important}} habitat for much wildlife, especially waterbirds such as lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), <b>white-winged</b> wood <b>duck</b> (Cairina scutulata) and spot-billed pelican (Pelicanus philippensis). Mammals of the mangroves include the tiger (Panthera tigris), the large Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and the siamang (Hylobates syndactylus). Reptiles found here include the water monitor (Varanus salvator), false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) and the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus).|$|R
50|$|There are two {{reserved}} {{forests in}} Hailakandi District, the inner line reserved forest and the Katakhal reserved forest. These were once rich in wildlife {{but this is}} now vanishing due to human onslaught. Rare species have been recorded, including the hoolock gibbon, Phayre's leaf monkey, pig-tailed macaque, <b>white-winged</b> wood <b>duck,</b> and purple wood pigeon. The southern part was also recommended as 'Dhaleswari' wildlife sanctuary.|$|R
