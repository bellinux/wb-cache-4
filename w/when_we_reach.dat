5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan {{argued that}} Tamarod protests on 14 August {{had failed to}} live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was {{conflicting}} instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title [...] "Tamarod Storm". Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it [...] "physically impossible" [...] for big numbers to gather in one place. In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, [...] "when everyone listens to the voice of reason, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored and when people feel they are equal before law and that they all are first class citizens." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of Kurosawa's 1958 film {{can be seen}} in the relationship between C-3PO and R2-D2, which evolved from the two bickering peasants in The Hidden Fortress, and a Japanese family crest seen in the earlier film is similar to the Imperial Crest. Star Wars also borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film, Yojimbo. In both films, several men threaten the hero, bragging about how wanted they are by the authorities, and have an arm being cut off by a blade; Kuwabatake Sanjuro (portrayed by Toshiro Mifune) is offered [...] "... twenty-five ryo now, twenty-five when you complete the mission ...", whereas Han Solo is offered [...] "Two thousand now, plus fifteen <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> Alderaan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matins of Great and Holy Friday {{is celebrated}} {{on the evening}} of Holy Thursday. During this service, twelve Matins Gospels are chanted, from which this service derives its name of [...] "Matins of the Twelve Gospels". [...] These Gospel lessons recount in chronological order the events from the Last Supper though the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus. At one point, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> the first Gospel which speaks of the Crucifixion, there is a custom for the priest to bring out a large cross with an icon the crucified Christ {{attached}} to it, and places it {{in the center of the}} nave for all the faithful to venerate. This cross will remain in the center of the church until the bringing out of the plashchanitza the next evening.|$|E
2500|$|The Wu generals said, [...] "When {{the enemy}} learns that the Grand Tutor (Zhuge Ke) is coming here personally, they will surely retreat <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> the shore." [...] However, only Ding Feng had a {{different}} view, [...] "No. They are making large movements in their territory. They are prepared, as they have mobilised large numbers of troops from Xuchang and Luoyang, so why would they go back empty-handed? Don't think that the enemy won't come. We should ready ourselves for battle." [...] When Zhuge Ke reached Dongxing, he placed Ding Feng, Liu Zan (留贊), Lü Ju and Tang Zi {{in charge of the}} vanguard and they moved west along mountainous terrain. Ding Feng warned, [...] "We are moving too slow. If the enemy seizes favourable ground, it will be harder to deal with them." [...] He then led 3,000 soldiers with him, travelling on a different route from the main bulk of Wu forces.|$|E
