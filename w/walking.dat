5|$|Cars are the {{preferred}} {{mode of transport}} in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) and <b>walking</b> (1.3%). The low number of <b>walking</b> commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due to {{the limited number of}} workplaces within <b>walking</b> distance.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When <b>walking</b> as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when <b>walking,</b> both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (<b>walking</b> on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{she began}} {{painting}} pictures of each Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse {{to win the}} breed's World Grand Championship, held annually {{as part of the}} Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse National Celebration.

5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, <b>walking</b> {{on the whole}} of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, <b>walking</b> on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, <b>walking</b> on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of <b>walking,</b> some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by <b>walking,</b> {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to <b>walking</b> rather than running, {{although}} birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E

5|$|The Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse Breeders' Association {{was formed}} in 1935, with the name changed to the current Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association (TWHBEA) in 1974. The stud book was closed in 1947, meaning that since that date every Tennessee Walker must have both parents {{registered}} {{to be eligible for}} registration. In 1950, the United States Department of Agriculture recognized the Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse as a distinct breed. In 2000, the Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse was named the official state horse of the US state of Tennessee. It is the third most common breed in Kentucky, behind the Thoroughbred and the American Quarter Horse. As of 2005, 450,000 horses have been registered {{over the life of the}} TWHBEA, with annual registrations of 13,000–15,000 new foals. While the Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse is most common in the southern and southeastern US, it is found throughout the country.|$|E

After <b>walking</b> through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A smash cut skips the narrative forward to a scene with Anita and Borges lying shot {{in a room full}} of crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what looks to be an airport. The player is then taken to a dark room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After <b>walking</b> through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding.|$|E

5|$|Nipper was {{inducted}} into the Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse Hall of Fame, as well as being inducted into the Tennessee Agriculture Hall of Fame. She was listed in Who's Who by the Tennessee <b>Walking</b> Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association and was given an award for her paintings by the <b>Walking</b> Horse Trainers' Association. In the 1980s, she was selected to paint a horse-themed plate that was given to American president Ronald Reagan who also owned a Nipper painting on canvas. In 1982, her work was displayed in the Fine Arts Pavilion at the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2012, Nipper painted an ornament that decorated the Christmas tree at the Governor of Tennessee's mansion. Nipper was also commissioned to paint pictures for Zsa Zsa Gabor and Shania Twain.|$|E

25|$|Power <b>walking</b> or speed <b>walking</b> is {{the act of}} <b>walking</b> with a {{speed at}} {{the upper end of}} the natural range for <b>walking</b> gait, {{typically}} 7 to 9km/h (4.5 to 5.5mph). To qualify as power <b>walking</b> as opposed to jogging or running, at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times (see also fitwalking).|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of <b>walking,</b> including bushwalking, racewalking, beach <b>walking,</b> hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic <b>walking,</b> trekking and hiking. Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill <b>walking</b> or just <b>walking</b> in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term <b>walking</b> is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is <b>walking</b> in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular <b>walking.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Walking</b> {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} <b>walking</b> for below-knee-amputees. <b>Walking</b> is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid <b>walking</b> form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the <b>walking</b> capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
25|$|The gulls are generalist feeders. Indeed, {{they are}} the least {{specialised}} of all the seabirds, and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming, flying, and <b>walking.</b> They are more adept <b>walking</b> on land than most other seabirds, and the smaller gulls {{tend to be more}} manoeuvrable while <b>walking.</b> The <b>walking</b> gait of gulls includes a slight side to side motion, something that can be exaggerated in breeding displays. In the air, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.|$|E
