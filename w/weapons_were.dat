5|$|Defenders might {{sometimes}} dig counter-tunnels {{in order}} to reach the enemy's mines and launch an attack; frequently thermal <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> used to drive the besiegers from the tunnels.|$|E
5|$|More <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{added to}} the game, including: the 9mm Pistol, the Single Shotgun, Powder Charges, Dynamite, Trail Carbine, and Grenade Launcher.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} ideas for using {{petroleum}} {{on a larger}} scale and although many proved fruitless, some practical <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> developed.|$|E
50|$|Toy <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> toys which imitate real <b>weapons,</b> but <b>are</b> {{designed}} {{for children to}} play with. Though some can be potentially hazardous, toy <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> generally not meant to cause bodily harm.|$|R
5000|$|A new stat for <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> [...] "weight", {{ranging from}} 0 (light) to 8 (unmovable). Heavyweight <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> very slow.|$|R
50|$|This <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> {{used in the}} Koei {{video game}} Dynasty Warriors by Diao Chan. However, this <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> only {{available}} to her in Dynasty Warriors 1-5, but {{is referred to as}} a set of maces. After the 5th installment her main <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> changed to a Chain Whip.|$|R
5|$|Both <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> to be {{sufficiently}} compact {{to be carried}} hands-free on the user's person at all times, whether in the cab of a vehicle or the cockpit of an aircraft, and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Early thermal <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> devices or {{substances}} used {{in warfare}} during the classical and medieval periods (approx 8th century BC until the mid-16th century AD) which used heat or burning action to destroy or damage enemy personnel, fortifications or territories.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to capture}} weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were {{conducted}} on trains carrying equipment to the front, {{as well as on}} guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Mega Man series: <b>Weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{earned from}} the Robot Masters/Mavericks upon {{defeating}} them. The <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> kept until {{the game is}} turned off (unless a password is used which can bring the player back to a point after the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> acquired) or when the game is completed.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted as}} army rifle for the Norwegian Army. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> in service until World War II.|$|R
50|$|Production of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{funded by}} a Swedish steel {{producer}} and banker (later weapons maker) named Thorsten Nordenfelt, who was working in London. The name of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> changed to the Nordenfelt gun. A plant producing the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> set up in England, with sales offices in London, and long demonstrations were conducted at several exhibitions. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the British Royal Navy, as an addition to their Gatling and Gardner guns.|$|R
5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. These <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> slow to reload, so {{to ensure that the}} castle would {{have a good chance of}} hitting enemy ships passing at speed, two long batteries of <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there a few years before and also required the castle's moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1941, more {{sophisticated}} <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> made {{available such as}} the Blacker Bombard anti-tank weapon, the Northover Projector (a black-powder mortar), and the Smith Gun (a small artillery gun that could be towed by a private motorcar).|$|E
5|$|Nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} during World War II by the Manhattan Project, which created {{a network of}} production facilities, and the weapons research and design laboratory at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Two types of bombs were developed: the Mark 1 Little Boy, a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235, and the Mark 3 Fat Man, an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the coaxial weapon in the American M60 tank. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> evaluated by both the US Army and the US Naval weapon center, who reported that the performance of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> outstanding during all phases of testing. However, neither chose to adopt the weapon.|$|R
50|$|This <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{traditionally}} {{used with}} brute force, as the strength needed to heft such <b>weapons</b> <b>was</b> considerable. As a result, this <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> not often practiced by kung fu enthusiasts, and newly made replicas may be hollow. However, routines for this weapon still exist in some styles. Chui {{are almost always}} used in pairs.|$|R
50|$|An anti {{ballistic}} <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> any <b>weapon</b> (<b>be</b> it a missile, a laser {{or another}} type of object) designed to counter threats which are ballistic objects.|$|R
5|$|On 15 October 1959, a B-52 {{from the}} 492d Bomb Squadron at Columbus AFB, Mississippi {{carrying}} 2 nuclear weapons collided in midair with a KC-135 tanker near Hardinsburg, Kentucky; 4 of the 8 crew {{members on the}} bomber and all 4 crew on the tanker were killed. One of the nuclear bombs was damaged by fire but both <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> recovered.|$|E
5|$|Project Camel was the codename {{given to}} work {{performed}} by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) {{in support of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II. These activities included the development of detonators and other equipment, testing of bomb shapes dropped from Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, and the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, where explosive components of nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> manufactured.|$|E
5|$|The M249 SAW was {{not used}} heavily before the 1991 Gulf War, though {{it has been used}} in every major U.S. {{conflict}} since. American personnel in Somalia in 1993, Bosnia in 1994, Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq since 2003 have been issued M249s. Surplus <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> donated to Bolivia, Colombia and Tunisia.|$|E
50|$|Aliens {{demonstrated}} its capabilities {{with the}} M56 Smartgun, a handheld light machine gun. This <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{connected to the}} user's Head-Up Display, showing where the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> aimed. It was also equipped with a motion-sensitive auto-tracking system, capable of autonomous and accurate targeting of moving objects (the real <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> a MG42 with a Steadicam harness).|$|R
25|$|The {{theory of}} peace without <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> {{as old as}} {{philosophy}} and human consciousness. This theory holds that <b>weapons</b> per se <b>are</b> a threat to peace, and a removal of all <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> the way to everlasting peace.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} [...] "specially dangerous". Licences for such <b>weapons</b> can only <b>be</b> granted {{on a very}} limited basis and are essentially for recognized collectors and filming purposes only. A <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> considered specially dangerous if: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{defensive}} forces sustained 20,000 casualties, {{and about}} 1,300 <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{captured by the}} Germans. Grigoriev was arrested by Russian authorities, tried, and sentenced to fifteen {{years in prison for}} failure to properly perform his duties. He also suffered the revocation of all his awards, military degrees, and honors. The Germans used materials from the fortress elsewhere during their war against Russia.|$|E
5|$|A Six Person Intergender Tag Team Bimbo Brawl {{match with}} Traci Brooks as the Special Guest Referee was next, pitting {{the team of}} ODB, Rhaka Khan, and Rhino against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love, Cute Kip, and Velvet Sky). In this bout, {{both male and female}} wrestlers could fight each other and all <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> legal to use. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Rhino won the match for his team after {{tackling}} Kip with his signature Gore maneuver at 6 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of <b>weapons,</b> <b>were</b> all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E

50|$|About 14% of Russian {{chemical}} <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{stored in}} Shchuchye and, {{with the help}} of the US-supported Nunn-Lugar program, a new facility to destroy these chemical <b>weapons</b> <b>was</b> opened there in May 2009.|$|R
40|$|The {{authorized}} {{international trade}} in small arms and light <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> diverse and dynamic, affecting every {{region of the world}} and all levels of society. Recreational hunters and other private individuals buy millions of imported rifles, shotguns, and rounds of ammunition each year.

Most of these <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> used in accordance with national an...|$|R
5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> captured.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> dropped by 1988.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{features}} a [...] "Weapon Synthesis" [...] system similar to Dark Cloud and Dark Chronicle, {{which allows the}} player to combine weapons. For every victory in battle, each weapon carried by active characters gains experience points. When a weapon has gained {{a certain amount of}} experience, it becomes [...] "Maxed." [...] After a <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> maxed, it continues to gain additional experience in specific elemental categories - fire, ice, lightning, wind, and holy. When the experience and the elemental damage are both at maximum, a <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Mastered" [...] and cannot be improved any further. However, once a <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> maxed, it becomes available for synthesis with another maxed weapon of the same type. When two maxed <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> synthesized, a stronger <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> created, and must be maxed again to become available for subsequent synthesis.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} classes of weapons: melee weapons, {{short-range}} weapons, long-range weapons, and support fire <b>weapons.</b> Melee <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> used at melee range {{and have a}} tendency to strike the body part of its target. Tonfas and rods are examples of melee <b>weapons.</b> Short-range <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> used at close range and deal damage to all parts of a target. Machine guns and shotguns are examples of short-range <b>weapons.</b> Long-range <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> that have long firing ranges and are ideal for avoiding counterattacks. Bazookas are examples of long-range weapons. Support fire <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> indirect fire weapons; they can never be counterattacked, but have limited ammunition supply and minimum firing ranges. Missile launchers are examples of support fire weapons. Lastly, shields can be equipped on wanzers to absorb some of the damage taken from incoming attacks.|$|R
