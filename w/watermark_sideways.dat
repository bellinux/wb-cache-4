25|$|Varieties of {{different}} kinds exist in many different issues. Watermark variations are common. For example, in the 1994, definitive series, inverted watermark (Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 12 and Rs. 15) and <b>watermark</b> <b>sideways</b> (Rs. 10, Rs. 15 and Rs. 20) are known.|$|E
50|$|The stamps {{were printed}} in {{landscape}} format by Harrison & Sons in England in two panes of 100, 10 x 10, with the cylinder numbers {{appearing on the}} right of the bottom margins, one for each colour, the left pane being numbered 1A and the right pane numbered 1B. There were two types of gum in use, Gum Arabic and PVA, the differences are clear to see, Gum Arabic being glossy and PVA matt. The colours were not produced by the standard four colour lithography method, cyan, yellow, magenta and black, but had dedicated colours as required by each value printed in photogravure. The left of the bottom margin contained colour check blocks, one for each colour surrounded by a black box, this black being for the State customisation black cylinder. The first issues were on paper watermarked 'Multiple SPM' upright and comb perforated 14 1/2. A few values appeared later on with <b>watermark</b> <b>sideways</b> and then later again without watermark.|$|E
50|$|Several of New Zealand's health stamps have notable {{varieties}} recognised by collectors. The 1957 set {{was issued}} with <b>watermark</b> either <b>sideways</b> or upright, and the 1960 set is found with two different gauges of perforation, {{one of which}} came from the miniature sheets. Stamps from the 1977 miniature sheet feature slight design differences, notably {{the lack of a}} white border around the design.|$|R
