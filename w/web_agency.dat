40|$|In {{this report}} we {{compare the two}} {{programming}} languages PHP and C# in. Net. They are both used to create dynamic websites and on the web there's a debate going on about which of these languages you're recommended to use. With this report {{we want to make}} ourselves a more scientific base of which of these languages that is the most used language and which languages that are the most suitable for creating dynamic websites. We have two purposes with this report: 1. To compare the usage of the programming languages C# in. Net and PHP at <b>web</b> <b>agencies,</b> advertising agencies and combinded agencies in Sweden today. 2. To get a better insight in the languages partly theoretical and partly through making a practical comparison of how you program in those languages. We have chosen to use four methods to reach our purposes; interviews, survey, lite-rature study and practical work. To among else find out which of PHP and C# in. Net that are the most common language, at <b>web</b> <b>agencies,</b> advertising agencies and combined agencies in Sweden today, we created a survey which we sent out to 100 companies in five counties. The interviews were done before the survey was designed since they were the foundation for the questions in the survey. All theoretical background is built on our literature study but we also got a little help from our literature study during our practical work. During our practical work we created two similar websites, one in each language to practically to be able to compare how the both codes are written and to make ourselves an opinion about how it feels to program in the both languages. From the survey we found out that PHP is the most common language at the different types of agencies that we studied. We also found out that the companies who answered the survey believes that PHP still will be the most common language in Sweden in year 2015 of the two studied languages PHP and C# in. Net. The survey also showed that good qualities in PHP are among others the simplicity, open source and platform independent. Worse qualities in PHP are that it lacks in troubleshooting, has low performance and too many versions. We think that PHP overall is the easier language to program in, in comparison with C# in. Net since the way you write the code in PHP feels more understandable and logical. Many of the advantages and disadvantages we experienced consists with the agencies opinions regarding PHP, but also with the opinions regarding C# in. Net since it's fast, compiled and a well structured language. Worse qualities in C# in. Net we experienced are that it's own by Microsoft, less spread and has complicated code. The conclusions {{of this study is that}} PHP is the most used programming language at the <b>web</b> <b>agencies,</b> advertising agencies and the combined agencies that this study included, that the both programming languages differ from eachother more than we predicted both theoretical and programmatically and PHP is better suited for less com-plicated programming while C# in. Net is more suited for advanced programming...|$|R
