40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{repetition}} effect bias noted in prior psychology literature impacts auditor judgments. <b>Were</b> <b>auditors</b> to succumb to this bias, repeated statements would be perceived to have higher validity than single exposure to the same statement, potentially impairing subsequent judgments, including audit opinions and thereby undermining audit quality. Design/methodology/approach – Multiple explanatory hypotheses, including repeated explanations, were evaluated by audit seniors in an experimental analytical procedures setting where the nature (error or non-error) and number (six or ten) of explanations was varied. Findings – Auditors were not found to exhibit a repetition effect (measured as an absolute increase in perceived validity) however differences did occur in their judgments owing to both the nature and number of explanations considered. Consistently the likelihood for repeated items on short lists was increased and on longer it was decreased, while for non-errors it was increased and for errors it was decreased. Practical implications – These results suggest that audit quality could be impaired if auditors do not consider a broad set of plausible explanations, particularly where they receive repeated non-error explanations. Originality/value – No prior study has addressed this issue in this context. Auditing, Auditors, Bias, Financial analysis, Quality audit...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 Valuation {{of shares}} {{in a company}} {{influences}} many management decisions. The latest example is current legislation which makes it difficult if not impossible for a company to obtain contracts from local and provincial governments, financial institutions and other service providers, without the proper Black Economic Empowerment share-composition of the company. This {{is just one example}} of the issues which force companies, especially in the unlisted sector, to establish the value of their shares. The primary objective of this report was to critically investigate valuation procedures for unlisted companies in South Africa. A further objective was to theoretically and empirically investigate existing valuation models and which of these models were currently used by valuators. It was found during the investigation that the unlisted sector was more complex to value than the listed sector because of the difference in overall regulation between the two sectors. All the models researched in the literature were evaluated and those suitable for this sector were selected for in-depth research. The population identified was anyone who is in the business of the valuation of unlisted companies in South Africa. The sample, as a properly representative subset of the population, was identified as 97 valuators. The valuators <b>were</b> <b>auditors,</b> business brokers, attorneys, bankers and accountants. The results of the surveys are reliable, because it was ensured that a proper cross-section of respondents was obtained. A questionnaire comprising of 11 categories was structured and questions grouped to address valuation procedures (Appendix 1). A follow-up questionnaire that focused on different valuation models, including sub- approaches used in the unlisted sector was also constructed (Appendix 2). Because of the perceived complexity of valuations, telephone interviews ascertained that the questions were answered without any ambiguity. Seventy seven percent of the 97 questionnaires were completed. The most insightful information gained was that only 6, 7 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} a standard valuation model/procedure was being used. The survey on the valuation models delivered interesting results. It was found that there is a trend to use the Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF). The Earnings Multiple Method and Price Earnings were still being used amongst the respondents. The results of the studies were documented and factors came up which could be used to design a proper valuation procedure in the unlisted sector. Master...|$|E
40|$|Background and problem: After {{the break}} {{up of the}} Soviet Union, Russia has {{experienced}} a lot of turmoil and change both politically and economically. The country has struggled {{to get rid of}} its socialist past and it has now evolved to be a more and more important partner in international affairs and economics. The need to develop a modern accounting system has therefore been obvious and the country had two choices: to develop its own system or to adopt an existing one, like IFRS. Purpose: The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate how the process of IFRS adoption for the national accounting system develops in Russia. The additional purposes are to show how Russia works with reformation of its accounting system, how the national historic and economic development affected accounting and financial reporting, and to define obstacles and problems which the country in general, and separate companies, in particular, have come across in connection with IFRS implementation. Another purpose has been to contribute to Göteborg University with useful information with a subject that nobody has researched at the School of Business, Economics and Law before. Delimitations: As the field of study Russian non-banking companies which use IFRS were chosen. The study is delimited by description and analyse the general and common problems and obstacles for industrial companies they meet on their way of IFRS implementation. Method: The most important source of information was a conference about IFRS in Russia held in St. Petersburg in November 2005. The lectures given and interviews made with attendants from this conference provided the author with unique first hand material. People interviewed <b>were</b> <b>auditors</b> as well as financial managers at companies. Other printed information about IFRS in Russia was mainly found on the Internet as it is still a new subject with relatively little written about it. Analysis and conclusions: The Russian government works for a reformation of the accounting system and to encourage companies to shift to IFRS. The reasons why companies shift to IFRS are many. The strongest incentive is that this will more easily attract foreign investors and give them loans at a lower interest. The Bank of Russia also encourages this step and has demanded that banks use IFRS already from January 1, 2004. The transition is slowed {{because of the fact that}} a considerable part of the Russian economy is in the grey sector. IFRS introduction implies high costs for companies in form of education and IT. On the other hand, these investments help modernize the companies and improve their operational and strategic management. Factors that affect statement quality were also researched. Among them there are converging and transformation methods, degree of information disclosure and auditing. The fate of IFRS in Russia is, however, not clear yet because of problems with the translation and a fear of loosing political control...|$|E
