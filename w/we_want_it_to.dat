25|$|This {{early work}} in {{historical}} analysis {{of law and}} legal thought laid the basis for Unger's contribution to the Critical Legal Studies movement. The movement itself {{was born in the}} late 1970s among young legal scholars at Harvard Law School who denounced the theoretical underpinnings of American jurisprudence, legal realism. The participants were committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality without the hidden interests and class domination of legal institutions. Two tendencies of the movement developed, one, a radical indeterminacy that criticized law as meaning anything <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> mean, and the other, a neo-Marxist critique that attacked legal thought as an institutional form of capitalism. Unger offered a third tendency, a constructive vision of rethinking rights based on individual emancipation and empowerment, and structural arrangements that would lend themselves to constant revision with the goal of creating more educational and economic opportunities for more people. He laid this out in The Critical Legal Studies Movement, which quickly earned him a following as the philosophical mentor and prophet of the movement.|$|E

One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, whatever we decide to do, I want the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E
500|$|When asked {{during a}} Reddit [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] in October 2013 {{whether there were}} plans for a {{follow-up}} film, Guggenheim said, [...] "I think {{about it a lot}} – I think we need one right now." [...] In 2014, The Hollywood Reporter reported that the producers of the film were in talks over a possible sequel. [...] "We have had conversations," [...] co-producer Bender said. [...] "We've met; we've discussed. If {{we are going to make}} a movie, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> have an impact." [...] Co-producer David also believed a sequel was needed. [...] "God, do we need one," [...] David said. [...] "Everything in that movie has come to pass. At the time we did the movie, there was Hurricane Katrina; now we have extreme weather events every other week. The update has to be incredible and shocking." ...|$|E

It was the longest we’d spent on anything ever we’ve done. We knew how <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get <b>it</b> perfect, so yeah, we {{spent a long time}} on it. And I tell you; we had {{to make a lot of}} tough choices, with the sequencing. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be perfect, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> all the different energies to flow into each other just so.” ...|$|R

500|$|The title {{sequence}} of SpongeBob {{for the special}} was made exclusively for the series' tenth anniversary. It was animated in stop motion animation, with Cee Lo Green performing the theme. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated its opening titles. Finnegan claimed that the crew were [...] "thrill" [...] to do the title sequence because [...] "the original title sequence is so recognizable and everyone seen {{it over and over}} and it's so great in its own way." [...] Executive producer and the episode's writer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "We don't just want to redraw it , <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be something special and different So we thought we would do it in three dimensions" [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson lauded the new title sequence and said it is [...] "SO great!" [...] Some traditional animation on scraps of brown paper are intermixed into the stop motion.|$|E
500|$|On August 1, 2005, Rowland {{announced}} {{the release of}} a greatest hits album later that year during an interview with Billboard magazine. She said, [...] "We're definitely going to record another song for our greatest hits album for our fans. We're still thinking about it because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> mean something." [...] In September, the album's title #1's was revealed along with a release date on October 25, 2005. A DualDisc edition of #1's was also announced with the same songs of the standard edition mixed in 5.1 surround sound on a CD as well as bonus content on a DVD containing seven music videos and a trailer for the live album [...] (2005). The album was also released as a two-pack set at Walmart including the original CD and a DVD titled [...] "Fan Pack II" [...] which contained live performances of two songs, three music videos of the members' solo songs and bonus footage.|$|E
500|$|Hawley {{also brought}} his visual effects {{supervisor}} John Ross from Fargo. Ross coordinated multiple visual effects vendors for Legion, {{which he described}} as [...] "a bit of a crapshoot" [...] because artists were often not able {{to work on the}} same shot week-to-week. He noted that though [...] "hundreds of thousands of dollars" [...] was spent on major visual effect sequences for the show, [...] "we don’t dwell on that aspect. There’s a jeep that gets slammed down , which the characters hide behind before it gets flung back into the building, but we pan off it, just throwing it away, because the destruction isn’t the point of the scene." [...] He compared this mindset to M. Night Shyamalan's approach to superpowers in Unbreakable. When realizing characters' special abilities, Ross said it [...] "comes down to tying this fantastic beam coming out to somebody’s hand, and showing how it lights up a face and distorts the air as it travels across frame. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> look as much like a live interactive element as we can imagine it to be." ...|$|E

Valentinas and Gabe Hoffman wanted to make a film about victims of sexual exploitation.

5000|$|The band filmed two sold-out {{performances}} on 18 & 19 May 2005 in Tokyo {{in which the}} latter footage was used instead. When talking about releasing a live DVD during the band's tour {{and the reason for}} choosing their preferred location for filming, Glenn Tipton explains, [...] "We talked about doing a DVD on this tour and we decided <b>to</b> do <b>it</b> at the Budokan because it's a special venue. It's world-renowned. We thought it was an ideal choice. We filmed both nights but we ended up using the second night only for this DVD. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be as live and as real as possible, and when you start taking from different shows there isn't continuity. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be one show and that's exactly what it is." ...|$|R
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearing that {{introducing}} the character as an [...] " [...] to the boys" [...] would hinder {{their chances of}} successfully integrating her into the series, the writers intended that Ruby should be [...] "a character in [...] own right" [...] and deemed her an antagonist [...] "with [...] own interests and [...] own motives" [...] rather than a love interest to Sam or Dean, which they felt had been their mistake in their introduction of the widely disliked Jo Harvelle in the second season. While they were not planning on a romance between Ruby and either of the Winchesters in the third season, however, they were open to the possibility in the future, with Kripke saying, [...] "If the chemistry is there, {{and we see the}} sparks, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> happen, and the fans want it to happen, it'll happen." [...] Due to [...] "protective and occasionally nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant to introduce Ruby in [...] "small doses". Wanting fans to know the show would always be about Sam and Dean, and nothing else, he stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor is it about the four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rob {{has said}} he favors this album to the {{previous}} one, stating, [...] "I was never that happy with it La Sexorcisto. In some respects, {{it was probably the}} best thing we could do at the time under the circumstances; and that this record was exactly what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound like." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the series finale came after {{research}} showed that rape is used to punish girl gang members. Series Producer Tim Key says [...] "That is what The Bill has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be like that {{right up until the}} final shot." ...|$|R
50|$|Normally {{we start}} with a riff from Joe, and then we add drums {{sometimes}} with a machine, then I start writing lyrics, then we all start jamming on the song. It took us about one year to make so we could make sure it sounded the way <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound. Actually, we’re already writing a new record (laughs).|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the sequel will be shot in real time, Reeves stated, [...] "You see, that's a {{difficult}} part: <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be shot like the first {{but how can you}} continue that idea successfully for a second time?... We have a lot of affection for the original and the sequel can't just be the same thing. But that is tricky when {{you need to have a}} monster destroying stuff once again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Raikes, ex-president of the Microsoft Business Division, stated: [...] "If they're {{going to}} pirate {{somebody}}, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be us rather than somebody else". An analogous argument {{was made in}} an early paper by Kathleen Conner and Richard Rummelt. A subsequent study of digital rights management for e-books by Gal Oestreicher-Singer and Arun Sundararajan showed that relaxing some forms of DRM can be beneficial to digital rights holders because the losses from piracy are outweighed by the increases in value to legal buyers.|$|E
2500|$|... "The idea of benign or hostile space aliens {{from other}} planets visiting the eEarth [...] an {{emotional}} idea. There are two sorts of self-deception here: either accepting {{the idea of}} extraterrestrial visitation by space aliens {{in the face of}} very meager evidence because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be true; or rejecting such an idea out of hand, in the absence of sufficient evidence, because we don't want it to be true. Each of these extremes is a serious impediment to the study of UFOs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cabel Sasser {{has written}} that he and Steven Frank had one goal with Audion: [...] "we wanted to listen to our music CDs on our {{computers}} while we worked, and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be stylish." [...] During Audion's development, MP3 files became a popular means of listening to music on a computer, and Panic licensed an MP3 decoder for incorporation into Audion.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{pronounced}} {{their name}} [...] "Day, Month, Year" [...] while in text {{it appears as}} [...] "DD/MM/YYYY".

[...] "So one day we saw the movie Heathers, and there's a line where Christian Slater asks, 'Are you a Heather?' and Winona Ryder's character Veronica answers, 'No, I'm a Veronica,' and so we went with that, because she was this kind of cool, unique chick with an attitude." ...|$|R
2500|$|An event called [...] "Students for Chief Illiniwek Presents: The Next Dance," [...] {{happened}} on November 15, 2008 following {{the football game}} against Ohio State University, in the Assembly Hall.

2500|$|Outlining {{the scale}} of the problem, Duncan Smith said almost five million people were on {{unemployment}} benefits, 1.4million of whom had been receiving support for nine or more of the last 10 years. In addition, 1.4million under-25s were neither working nor in full-time education. He said; [...] "This picture is set against a backdrop of 13 years of continuously increasing expenditure, which has outstripped inflation ... Worse than the growing expense though, {{is the fact that the}} money is not even making the impact <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> ... A system that was originally designed to support the poorest in society is now trapping them in the very condition it was supposed to alleviate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, nodes {{have one}} k-bucket. When the k-bucket becomes full, {{it can be}} split. The split occurs if the range of nodes in the k-bucket spans the node's own id (values {{to the left and}} right in a binary tree). Kademlia relaxes even this rule for the one [...] "closest nodes" [...] k-bucket, because {{typically}} one single bucket will correspond to the distance where all the nodes that are the closest to this node are, they may be more than k, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> know them all. It may turn out that a highly unbalanced binary sub-tree exists near the node. If k is 20, and there are 21+ nodes with a prefix [...] "xxx0011....." [...] and the new node is [...] "xxx000011001", the new node can contain multiple k-buckets for the other 21+ nodes. This is to guarantee that the network knows about all nodes in the closest region.|$|E

5000|$|Although Ghost used choirs {{on their}} {{previous}} album, {{they had a}} lot of issues doing so. This time, the band decided to go the extra mile and spend the necessary money. A Nameless Ghoul said, [...] "There are a lot of mellotron choirs on there because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> feel a little bit synthetic and simulated. The choir symbolizes the gothic element that comes in all of a sudden".|$|R
500|$|<b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> {{the video}} {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. <b>We</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> show movement and energy and for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|R
2500|$|Bruce Gyngell, {{the former}} {{chairman}} of breakfast station TV-am, [...] became YTT's managing director on 15 May 1995. On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting [...] "a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region", in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as Channel 3. The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the 'official' name for ITV, and [...] "3" [...] was the preset used by most television sets and videocassette recorders (VCRs) for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network [...] was decommissioned within three years. Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, [...] "Everyone refers to this region as 'the North-East' and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be known that we are part of this great region and moving with it."
