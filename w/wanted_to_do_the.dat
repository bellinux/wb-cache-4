5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of knowing how many kits an article would sell, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting it on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E

5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E

We're just having the damnedest time writing it. I'll bet that within two years, we'll be shooting that movie. I'd say we're about half-way there. It's not only writing a great historical mystery, but we've gotta write {{something that has}} nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with anything we've <b>done</b> before. <b>The</b> goal is to always have an original sequel, as silly as that sounds. We really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that the}} third one doesn’t just feel like a repeat of the first one, or one too many".|$|R

25|$|In 1963, actor Fernando Rey, one of {{the stars}} of Viridiana, {{introduced}} Buñuel to producer Serge Silberman, a Polish entrepreneur who had fled to Paris when his family died in the Holocaust and had worked with several renowned French directors, including Jean-Pierre Melville, Jacques Becker, Marcel Camus and Christian-Jaque. Silberman proposed that the two make an adaptation of Octave Mirbeau's Journal d'une femme de chambre, which Buñuel had read several times. Buñuel <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> filming in Mexico with Pinal, but Silberman insisted it be done in France.|$|E
25|$|Ashby was busted for {{possession}} of marijuana while scouting locations in Canada. This almost changed the studio's mind about backing the project, but the director's drug bust was not widely reported and Nicholson remained fiercely loyal to him, which was a deciding factor. Just as the film {{was about to go}} into production, Crosse was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow Crosse to deal with the news and decide if he still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> film. The actor decided not to do the film, and Ashby and Stalmaster scrambled to find a replacement. They cast Otis Young.|$|E
25|$|Adams' {{stories were}} never novelised, {{reportedly}} because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job himself. However, {{soon after his}} tenure with Doctor Who ended, the author had gained considerable popularity because of his The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy franchise and became (depending upon the source of information) either too busy or too expensive (or both). Adams would later recycle elements of City of Death and the unbroadcast Shada into his Dirk Gently novels. As for Saward's two Dalek serials, Target Books was unable {{to come to an}} agreement which would satisfy both Eric Saward and Terry Nation's estate for the novelisations. Virgin tried again at a later date and authors were assigned for both books, but again an agreement was not reached.|$|E

25|$|Beginning at WrestleMania 32, a {{match between}} Big Show and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal had been teased from various media outlets, {{including}} WWE. Shaq {{was a surprise}} entrant in the 2016 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal where he and Big Show faced off, but the other participants eliminated both of them. In July at the 2016 ESPY Awards on the red carpet, Show and Shaq had another brief confrontation. A match was proposed for WrestleMania 33, which Shaq accepted. In January 2017, the two began calling each other out on social media, posting workout videos of themselves preparing for the potential match. Big Show then began to doubt Shaq's commitment to the match. By the end of February, Shaq said {{that it looked like}} the match was not going to happen, but he would still train just in case. The following week, Shaq said that discussions were back on between him and WWE. However, Big Show's announcement as a participant in the 2017 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal indicated that the match was off. According to Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the match was canceled due to monetary reasons, as both parties could not agree on a deal. Big Show said that he really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> match, especially since this would probably be his last WrestleMania and blamed Shaq's weight as a reason for why Shaq backed out.|$|E
25|$|New South Wales was {{the strongest}} state the MCC would meet on the tour, winning the Sheffield Shield 14 times in 16 seasons between 1948–49 and 1961–62 and nearly 60,000 people {{came to see the}} champions take on the touring team {{over the course of the}} four day match. New South Wales were led by the {{flamboyant}} Keith Miller who won the toss and put the visitors in to bat, much to Len Hutton's annoyance as he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same. Again he had to rescue the innings, making 102 and only receiving support from the baby-faced Colin Cowdrey who had yet to make a century in the County Championship, but made a sweetly timed 110 as they added 163 together. No other batsman exceeded 11 and the team was out for 252. Miller rotated his bowlers and the wickets were shared by Pat Crawford (3/51) whose drag allowed him to bowl a yard down the wicket, Alan Davidson (3/41), bowling with a shoulder injury, and the Chinamen of John Treanor (3/64). Young Billy Watson, playing in his second First Class match raced to 155 and with the help of his captain's 86 took New South Wales past the MCC score three wickets down. From there wickets fell steadily to Frank Tyson 4/98 and Alec Bedser 4/117, who was suffering from a rash, and they were all out for 382. To try out potential openers Hutton put Vic Wilson and Cowdrey in first. Wilson was out for a duck, but Cowdrey made another hundred (103), but only Hutton himself (87), batting at number 6, gave him any help. The MCC were out for 327, Cowdrey and Hutton making 402 of the 577 runs scored, the other 9 batsmen making 117 in two innings. Even Miller saw that 198 for victory in 75 minutes was impossible and sent in his young players for batting practice and Cowdrey went for 38 runs off 3 overs doing bowling impressions of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and others, but Peter Loader took 2/14 before the gamed ended with New South Wales on 78/2.|$|E
