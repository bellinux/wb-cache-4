The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

After setting an appropriate <b>weighting</b> <b>function</b> the cost may be minimized through the inversion of a NxN matrix. Determination of each matrix element requires at least one double integration involving the weighting functions, which may become computationally intensive. These are simplified if the weighting functions are simply delta functions, which corresponds to fitting the boundary conditions for the current along the conductor at only N discrete points. Then the NxN matrix must be inverted, which is also computationally intensive as N increases. In one simple example, Balanis performs this computation to find the antenna impedance with different N using Pocklington's method and finds that with N>60 solutions have approached their limiting values to within a few percent.|$|E

The difficulty in extending the bound of each clustering indicator is solved with this improvement. Findings – The findings of this paper are the novel grey cluster evaluation models based on mixed centre-point triangular whitenization <b>weight</b> <b>functions</b> and the novel grey cluster evaluation models based on mixed end-point triangular whitenization <b>weight</b> <b>functions.</b> Practical implications – A practical evaluation and decision problem for some projects in a university has been studied using the new triangular whitenization <b>weight</b> <b>function.</b> Originality/value – Particularly, compared with grey variable weight clustering model and grey fixed weight clustering model, the grey cluster evaluation model using whitenization <b>weight</b> <b>function</b> is more suitable to be used to solve the problem of poor information clustering evaluation. The grey cluster evaluation model using endpoint triangular whitenization <b>weight</b> <b>functions</b> is suitable for the situation that all grey boundary is clear, but the most likely points belonging to each grey class are unknown; the grey cluster evaluation model using centre-point triangular whitenization <b>weight</b> <b>functions</b> is suitable for those problems where it is easier to judge the most likely points belonging to each grey class, but the grey boundary is not clear...|$|R
