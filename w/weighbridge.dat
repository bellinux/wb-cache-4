During the hearing he stated that he had been at sea during the period 1898–1902, and had not been working since he returned, although he had visited Ceylon late the previous year looking for work. He and his wife had one daughter. He was enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery in September 1910, having lowered his age and given Auckland as his place of birth. He served as a soldier for a year before leaving his wife and child at their Park Lane home in London and travelling to Sydney, Australia. In the remaining years before the outbreak of World War I he worked as a clerk at a sugar mill <b>weighbridge</b> in Proserpine, Queensland, and while doing so, lived at Kelly's Club Hotel in Brandon, where he formed a close connection to the publican's family.|$|E
5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on a}} damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the <b>weighbridge</b> {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Montpelier {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels were reduced further, down to two booking clerks, four porters, a checker and a <b>weighbridge</b> operator by 1950. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. The goods yard at Montpelier closed on 18 November 1965, with the signal box following on 10 May 1967. Staff were completely withdrawn on 17 July 1967 with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the northern track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the southern platform. The former goods yard is now a small industrial estate. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in damp weather conditions with intermittent rain. Coulthard achieved his second pole position of the season, his first at the Hockenheimring, with a time of 1:45.697. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Michael Schumacher who was 1.3 seconds slower than Coulthard. Fisichella qualified third, though he was happy with his performance despite using his team's T-car after suffering a spin on his first run. He was later fined $5,000 for not placing his car at the pit-lane <b>weighbridge.</b> Häkkinen qualified fourth, three hundredths of a second slower than Fisichella. Häkkinen later admitted that he was cautious about going off the race track due to the weather conditions. de la Rosa qualified fifth giving Arrows their best qualifying performance of the season. Trulli and Wurz were satisfied with their sixth and seventh place qualifying positions. Herbert in the quicker of the two Jaguars took eighth. Villeneuve secured ninth using his team's spare car after spinning on track which disrupted Frentzen's running. Irvine rounded out the top ten. Verstappen had problems starting his engine, resulting in a lack of qualifying laps but managed to clinch eleventh. Zonta qualified twelfth having used a new engine and could not set a faster lap time after being blocked by Jean Alesi. He was ahead of Alesi's teammate Nick Heidfeld. Ralf Schumacher qualified in 14th, quicker than teammate Button in 16th. They were separated by Salo. Frentzen spent the majority of qualifying 107% outside of the pole sitters time but took 17th; his first quick time was disallowed after cutting the chicane to set a faster lap and to run in clean air. Barrichello used his teammate's car after his developed oil-leak issues and qualified 18th. Sauber's Pedro Diniz took 19th, in front of Alesi in 20th.

40|$|As part of {{the project}} to update the Malawian Directorate of Road Transport and Safety Services? (DRTSS) 2005 Axle Load Control Strategy and to provide a five-year {{implementation}} plan, a country-wide axle load survey was undertaken to assess the incidence of overloading on the paved road network in Malawi. The baseline axle load survey was undertaken by staff members from the DRTSS after attending a two-day training course on overload control and the operation of the portable scales that were used for the survey. Heavy vehicles were weighed at 17 sites in two phases. 2 691 heavy vehicles were weighed on 68 weigh days at an average of 39 heavy vehicles per day. Of the 2 691 vehicles weighed, 1 356 were overloaded, which represents an extent of overloading of 50. 4 %. The average overloaded mass on the 1 356 overloaded vehicles was 4 264 kg, representing an average degree of overloading of 26. 1 %. Weigh data from 4 of the 5 permanent <b>weighbridges</b> in Malawi were also analysed to compare the extent and degree of overloading measured at the permanent <b>weighbridges</b> with what was measured during the axle load survey.

Inside the Heapstead, tubs of coal from the shaft were weighed on a <b>weighbridge,</b> then tipped onto jigging screens, which sifted the solid lumps from small particles and dust - these were then sent along the picking belt, where pickers, often women, elderly or disabled people or young boys (i.e. workers incapable of mining), would separate out unwanted stone, wood and rubbish. Finally, the coal was tipped onto waiting railway wagons below, while the unwanted waste sent to the adjacent heap by an external conveyor.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the railway}} served clay pits {{to the east}} side of the road from Wareham to Corfe Castle, but shortly {{thereafter}} it was extended under the road to serve clay workings on the other side of the road. There are two tunnels under the road, serving different workings. The northern tunnel carries a plaque on its east face reading BF 1807. The southern tunnel has a plaque on its west face Dated in 1848, but as the tunnel is shown on earlier tithe maps, that is believed to be a rebuilding date. Workshops and a <b>weighbridge</b> were built near New Line Farm to the east of the road and weathering beds were also located here; these were dumps of newly dug clay which had to weather for up to a year to allow the clay to break down to make it workable.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session was delayed by twenty-five minutes following crashes in practice for the Guia Race of Macau and the CTM Touring Car Cup support races. When the session did start, Blomqvist came out on top with a lap of two minutes and 11.922 seconds having held the lead throughout most of qualifying, 0.115 seconds faster than Giovinazzi. Cassidy improved in qualifying's closing period and was the best placed rookie in third, with Auer battling Blomqvist early in the session and ended it fourth. King finished the session in fifth place on his final timed lap while early leader Verstappen secured sixth. Latifi improved late in qualifying to end up seventh in front of Buller. Rosenqvist and Ocon who used two new tyres to begin qualifying rounded out the top ten. Coletti was the fastest driver not {{to reach the top}} ten despite running fifth in the opening minutes of the session. Following him were Gelael, Antonio Fuoco with Santino Ferrucci provisionally joining Fuoco on the grid's seventh row. Félix Serrallés was next up ahead of Pommer, Álex Palou, Kanamaru, Merhi and Gustavo Menezes. The rest of the order was completed by Yamashita, Goddard, Wells, Cao, Calderón, MacLeod, Wing Chung Chang and Takaboshi. The session passed relatively smoothly with only Cao crashing into the barriers at Fisherman's bend and Calderón impacting the wall at Police corner. For missing red light that ordered them to enter the <b>weighbridge</b> during first practice, Ocon and Verstappen were each given two-place grid penalties, and MacLeod was penalised one grid position for illegally crossing the pit exit line.|$|E
50|$|From 1933 onwards, 650 Dresden class wagons were built, {{still in}} {{rivetted}} form, with an axle base increased from 7,000 mm to 7,700 mm. These demonstrated excellent running qualities and were therefore permitted {{to be used}} at speeds up to 90 km/h (secondary letter s). However it was problematic that the wagons did not fit on most <b>weighbridges</b> due to their long axle base.

50|$|For many uses (such as {{at police}} {{over the road}} truck weigh {{stations}} or temporary road intercepts) <b>weighbridges</b> have been largely supplanted by simple and thin electronic weigh cells, over which a vehicle is slowly driven. A computer records {{the output of the}} cell and accumulates the total vehicle weight. By weighing the force of each axle it can be assured that the vehicle is within statutory limits, which typically will impose a total vehicle weight, a maximum weight within an axle span limit and an individual axle limit. The former two limits ensure the safety of bridges while the latter protects the road surface.|$|R

The regular drivers again shared the back row of the grid after qualifying, with Chandhok ahead of Senna. The following day, Chandhok again finished in 18th place, with Senna two places behind after making an unscheduled pit stop for a new front wing, after losing his original part in a collision with Timo Glock's Virgin as the pair were being lapped. At the British Grand Prix, Yamamoto was promoted to the race team in favour of Senna. The drivers again qualified on the back row, with Chandhok ahead, and achieved another double finish in the same order, despite Chandhok sustaining aerodynamic damage to his car from debris. For the German Grand Prix, Senna reclaimed his seat, whilst Yamamoto moved across to the #20 car to replace Chandhok. Yamamoto qualified in 23rdposition, ahead of Di Grassi, who did not set a time due to a gearbox problem, whilst Senna set the 21st-quickest time, ahead of Vitantonio Liuzzi (Force India), who crashed during the session. Both drivers were then moved up an additional place on the grid when Glock was penalised for an unscheduled gearbox change. After racing with the other new teams, Senna was delayed by a slow puncture and finished in 19thplace, and Yamamoto retired on lap19 when his engine cut out. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, the drivers qualified on the back row of the grid. Senna, who qualified ahead, was then elevated to 22ndposition when Kamui Kobayashi (Sauber) was given a penalty for failing {{to stop at the}} pit-lane <b>weighbridge</b> when requested. Yamamoto, along with four other drivers, was given a reprimand for failing to achieve the maximum permitted lap time throughout the qualifying session.

25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and was similarly timed to the previous day's session. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Asmer {{come out on top}} with a time of two minutes and 13.122 seconds set nine minutes remaining in the session. The heavy damage to Grosjean's car forced him to sit out the session's opening minutes and gradually improved to be two-tenths adrift of Asmer and settled for provisionally second. Despite clipping the wall Yelmer Buurman ran strongly throughout and finished in third place with Buemi battling for pole position {{for the majority of the}} session until he dropped to fourth. Esteban Guerrieri made an improvement late on to end up fifth in front of Tsukakoshi in sixth and 2006 pole sitter Kamui Kobayashi stood in seventh. James Jakes, Streit and Jelley rounded out the top ten. Although he was at one point high up as fourth in the time sheets Jarvis was the quickest driver not to reach the top ten. Following him were the highest placed rookie Mortara, Oshima with Hülkenberg provisionally joining the Japanese driver on the seventh row in spite of him glancing the tyre barriers at Lisboa corner. Niall Breen was next up ahead of Atte Mustonen, Jonathan Kennard, Van Dam, Renger van der Zande and Senna. The rest of the order was completed Bird, Mailleux, Hartley, Grubmüller, Takuya Izawa, Ávila, Ho, Kit Meng. Cheong Lou Meng and the only driver to fail to record within 110% of Asmer was Merszei. Other incidents that occurred during first qualifying were Mustonen damaging his suspension against the tyre wall and Bird went into the barrier at Fisherman's Bend. Senna then crashed into the tyre barriers at San Francisco Bend and then was impacted by Izawa which prompted the waving of the red flags. After qualifying, numerous penalties were handed out. Kobayashi and Mutstonen were given three-place grid penalties for moving into the fast lane of the pit lane before it was declared open. Hülkenberg and Lou Meng were similarly penalised for ignoring the red light signal at the end of the pit lane which mandated them to enter the <b>weighbridge.</b>|$|E
