25|$|The Thar desert {{seems an}} ideal place for {{generation}} of electricity from wind power. According to an estimate Rajasthan state has got a potential of 5500 Megawatt wind power generation as such {{it is in the}} priority of the state govt. Rajasthan State Power Corporation has established its first wind power-based power plant at Amarsagar in Jaisalmer district. Some leading companies in the field are working on establishing <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> in Barmer, Jaisalmer and Bikaner districts. Solar energy also has a great potential in this region as most of the days during a year are cloud free. Solar energy based plant has been established at Bhaleri in Churu district to convert hard water into drinking water.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} mechanical devices before the Industrial Revolution were water and <b>wind</b> <b>mills.</b> [...] Water wheels date to Roman times and windmills somewhat later. [...] Water and wind power were first used for grinding grain into flour, but were later adapted to power trip hammers for pounding rags into pulp for making paper and for crushing ore. [...] Just before the Industrial revolution water power {{was applied to}} bellows for iron smelting in Europe. [...] (Water powered blast bellows were used in ancient China.) [...] Wind and water power were also used in sawmills.|$|E

2500|$|Pre-industrial {{machinery}} {{was built}} by various craftsmen – millwrights built water and <b>wind</b> <b>mills,</b> carpenters made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. [...] As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common. [...] Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts. [...] Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.|$|E
60|$|There were a {{great many}} <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> here and there along the dike. Some were for pumping up water, some for sawing logs, and some for {{grinding}} grain. These <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> were very large and exceedingly picturesque in their forms, and {{in the manner in}} which they were grouped with the other buildings connected with them. Rollo wished very much that he could stop and go on shore and visit some of these <b>wind</b> <b>mills,</b> so as to see how they looked inside.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{water that}} {{collects}} in these low canals and drains, which {{run across the}} polders, cannot flow out into the large canals, which are higher than they are, and {{so they have to}} pump it out. They pump it out generally by means of <b>wind</b> <b>mills.</b> So wherever you go, throughout all Holland, you find an immense number of <b>wind</b> <b>mills.</b> These <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> are very curious indeed. Some of them are immensely large. They look like lighthouses. The large ones are generally built of brick, {{and some of them are}} several hundred years old. The sails of the big ones are often fifty feet long, and sometimes eighty feet. This makes a wheel one hundred and sixty feet in diameter. When you stand under one of these mills, and look up, and see these immense sails revolving so high in the air that the lowest point, when the sail comes round, is higher than the tops of the four story houses, the effect is quite sublime.|$|E
60|$|The use {{of these}} very small <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> was to pump up the water from some very limited tract of land, which, for some reason or other, {{happened}} to lie a few inches lower than the rest.|$|E

60|$|Farther on {{the party}} came to an immense <b>wind</b> <b>mill,</b> which was {{employed}} in pumping up water. This <b>wind</b> <b>mill,</b> {{like most of the}} others, was built of brick. It rose to a vast height into the air, and there its immense sails were slowly revolving. The <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> was forty or fifty feet in diameter at the base, and midway between the base and the summit was a platform built out, that extended all around it. The sails of the mill, as they revolved, only extended down to this platform, and the platform itself was above the roofs of the four-story houses that stood near.|$|R
60|$|Rollo began; {{but when}} he got up to a hundred, he gave up the {{undertaking}} in despair. Mr. George told him that he read in the guide book that there were four thousand <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> in that region.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{of these}} <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> were very small indeed; {{and there were}} two or three which looked so [...] "cunning," [...] as Rollo said, that he wished very much that he had one of them to take with him to America.|$|E
60|$|In {{about an}} hour more the steamer began to draw near to Rotterdam. The {{approach}} to the town was indicated by the multitude of boats and vessels that were passing to and fro, and by the numbers of steamers and <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> that lined respectively {{the margins of the}} water and of the land. The <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> were prodigious in size. They towered high into the air like so many lighthouses; the tops of the sails, as Mr. George estimated, reached, as the vanes revolved, up to not less than one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet into the air. It was necessary to build them high, in order that the sails might not be becalmed by the houses.|$|E

60|$|To {{prevent this}} result it is {{necessary}} to adopt some plan to raise the water, as fast as it accumulates in the low grounds, and convey it away. This is done by pumps and other such hydraulic engines, and these are worked in general by <b>wind</b> <b>mills.</b>|$|E

The only mode that the Dutch had to pump out the water in former times was the <b>wind</b> <b>mills.</b> When the rains or the tides inundated the land, they called upon the wind to help them lift the water out to where it could flow away again.|$|E
60|$|In looking {{about over}} the country, there were <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> {{to be seen}} in all directions, their long arms slowly {{revolving}} in the air, and interspersed among them were the masts and sails of sloops and schooners, that were sailing to and fro along the canals. As the water of these canals was often hidden from view by the dikes which bordered them, {{it seemed as if the}} ships and steamers were sailing on the land in the midst of green fields and trees, and smiling villages.|$|E
