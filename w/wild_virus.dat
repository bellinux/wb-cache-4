40|$|Background Measles {{virus has}} a single, {{negative}} strand RNA genome which codes 6 structural proteins: N, F, P M, H and L. Currently {{there are several}} variances in the nucleotide sequences of N, F, M and H genes across <b>wild</b> type measles <b>viruses,</b> hence measles viruses can be categorized into clades and genotypes. The antigenicity of the previous genotype of measles {{is different from the}} current genotype. Objective To determine the antigenic differences between <b>wild</b> type measles <b>virus</b> and measles vaccine virus. Methods Analysis of the antigenic differences between <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> (G 2, G 3 and D 9) and vaccine virus (CAM- 70 and Schwarz) was performed by immunizing mice with the respective viruses. The serum was then tested with micro-cross-neutralization technique using the G 2, G 3, D 9 and CAM- 70 virus. Tests with cross ELISA examination technique were also performed using the same set of virus. Results Analysis of the cross neutralization test and cross ELISA showed that the highest antigenicity reaction was found between <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> with antibody against <b>wild</b> type <b>virus,</b> while the lowest reaction was between <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> with antibody against CAM- 70. Conclusions We conclude that the antigenicity of antigenic protein from <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> is higher than antigenicity of vaccine virus protein.

40|$|The {{antigenic}} {{properties of}} vaccine and wild type strains of measles virus were compared. Serum specimens from vaccinated persons, persons infected during the prevaccine era, or mice experimentally vaccinated with the hemagglutinin (H) protein from vaccine virus neutralized vaccine <b>virus</b> and a <b>wild</b> type measles <b>virus</b> from 1989 equally well. In contrast, serum specimens from patients with recent measles virus infection and mice experimentally vaccinated with the H protein from the <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> from 1989 neutralized <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> with titers 4 - 8 {{times higher than}} those to vaccine virus. Several H protein-specific monoclonal antibodies could dif-ferentially recognize vaccine or <b>wild</b> type <b>virus.</b> These data show that the H proteins of the recent <b>wild</b> type <b>viruses</b> contain both conserved and new or modified antigenic determinants and are consistent with previous studies that described genetic drift in the H proteins of recent <b>wild</b> type <b>viruses.</b> Measles causes [...] ., I million deaths a year in developing countries. Vaccination programs have greatly reduced the incidence of measles in developed countries, but sporadic outbreaks and some sustained epidemics of measles con-tinue. For example, """" 50, 000 cases of measles were reported in the United States between 1988 and 1991, a 10 -fold in-crease in the number ofcases reported for the previous 3 -year period [1]. Nearly one-half of these cases were in previously vaccinated persons. Though reasons for this resurgence are not fully understood, the most significant contribution was failure to maintain adequate vaccination coverage, particu-larly among the inner city populations. Another potential factor in the resurgence of measles is antigenic change. Genetic and antigenic variability exists among wild type strains of measles virus [2 - 7], and several genetic lineages of <b>wild</b> type <b>viruses</b> have been described [5, 6, 8].

50|$|One dose of OPV {{produces}} {{immunity to}} all three poliovirus serotypes in approximately 50% of recipients.

OPV produces excellent immunity in the intestine, the primary site of wild poliovirus entry, which helps prevent infection with <b>wild</b> <b>virus</b> {{in areas where the}} virus is endemic. The live virus used in the vaccine is shed in the stool and can be spread to others within a community. The live virus also has stringent requirements for transport and storage, which are a problem in some hot or remote areas.

Objective The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the differences in the antigenic profiles on immunoblotting between wild type and vaccine virus. Results The analysis results are 1) the antigen ofCAM- 70 vaccine virus was less able in cross reacting with the antibodies from G 2, G 3, 09, CAM- 70 and Schwarz; 2) The antibody aga inst CAM- 70 was only able to cross react with antigens of N protein and a few of antigens ofF proteins; 3) The <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> were very immunogenic, hence the antibody titers were very high; 4) The CAM- 70 and MMR vaccine virus were less immunogenic, hence their antibody were very low; 5) The antibody responses that always occurred from all immunized mice serum were antibody for N and F proteins. However, the antibody against CAM- 70 vaccine virus was still able to react with <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> (G 2, G 3 and 09).

40|$|Using {{decision}} analysis we evaluated {{the benefits and}} risks of continued primary reliance on oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) compared to use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). We followed a hypothetical cohort of 3. 5 million children from birth to age 30 assuming 95 per cent coverage with 98 per cent effective vaccine.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a follow-up serological study of 79 Brazilian children who, {{because of their}} young age, had failed to develop protective levels of immunity after vaccination against measles. There was serological evidence that infection with <b>wild</b> <b>virus</b> had occurred {{at a rate of}} about 17 % per annum. Approximately 1 ½ years after the initial vaccination, 46 % of the uninfected children maintained very low levels of neutralizing antibody, but did not have a measurable haemagglutination-inhibition titre. Revaccination did not elicit an IgM response in most children, but stimulated anti-measles IgG production in all of them. In 36 % of the children, the IgG titres fell again within three months to levels that may permit reinfection. If it is assumed that some of the persistent titres can be attributed to <b>wild</b> <b>virus</b> infection, the actual effect of revaccination would have been to immunize no more than 60 % of the susceptible group. The results suggest that early administration of measles vaccine may produce a cohort of children with inadequate immunity who cannot be fully immunized by revaccination. The implications of these findings for measles immunization programmes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In 2003 and 2013, the World Health Organization convened {{informal}} consultations on characterization {{and quality}} aspects of vaccines based on live virus vectors.

To provide an appropriate context for understanding the potential for recombination of virus-vectored vaccines, we review briefly {{the current status of}} virus-vectored vaccines, mechanisms of recombination between viruses, experience with recombination involving live attenuated vaccines in the field, and concerns raised previously in the literature regarding recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with <b>wild</b> type <b>virus</b> strains.

Poliovirus type 2 has been globally eradicated and the last detection of poliovirus type 3 dates to November 2012. Poliovirus type 1 remains the only circulating wild strain; between January and September 2016 it caused 26 cases (nine in Afghanistan, 14 in Pakistan, three in Nigeria). The use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been {{the key to success}} in the eradication effort. However, paradoxically, moving towards global polio eradication, the burden caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) becomes increasingly important. In this paper circulation of both <b>wild</b> <b>virus</b> and VDPVs is reviewed and implications for the polio eradication endgame are discussed. Between April and May 2016 OPV 2 cessation has been implemented globally, in a coordinated switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV. In order to decrease the risk for cVDPV 2 re-emergence inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been introduced in the routine vaccine schedule of all countries. The likelihood of re-emergence of cVDPVs should markedly decrease with time after OPV cessation, but silent circulation of polioviruses cannot be ruled out even a long time after cessation. For this reason, immunity levels against polioviruses should be kept as high as possible in the population by the use of IPV, and both clinical and environmental surveillance should be maintained at a high level...|$|E
