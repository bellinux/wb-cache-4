5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption. Some related species such as Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astrobiologist Chris McKay {{argued that}} if methanogenic life did {{exist on the}} surface of Titan, it <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> have a {{measurable}} effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere: levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected.|$|E

5|$|In mid January 2013, Japan's {{central bank}} {{signaled}} {{the intention to}} launch an open ended bond buying programme which <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> devalue the yen. This resulted in short lived but intense period of alarm {{about the risk of}} a possible fresh round of currency war.|$|E

5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions.

5|$|After {{the battle}} of Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler {{realised}} that Germany <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> lose the war, and ordered the formation of Sonderkommando 1005, a special task force under SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them {{in an attempt to}} cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished {{at the end of the}} war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E

5|$|Despite Nelson's {{fondness for}} the ship, she was {{frequently}} {{in need of}} repair and refitting, and <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> have been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American waters off Brazil.|$|E

5|$|During the {{presentation}} of the teams, the riders were asked to choose their top picks for the overall victory.

5|$|Eruptions <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows. Major construction would be needed to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean. On November10, three ships {{reported}} a cyclonic circulation northeast of Bermuda, with peak winds of 70mph (110km/h). It was a large system, and <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> have been classified a subtropical cyclone in the satellite era. The storm moved northeastward and weakened, degenerating into a trough on November12 before being merging with another system.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> have been noticed by the pope.|$|E
