500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> tight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Without the {{availability}} of antibiotics at the time, medical personnel {{found that it was}} beneficial to get the flu victims out of crowded hospitals, where many of them would die, and into tents where they would get a lot more fresh air. [...] According to Draper, [...] "if we could bed [...] down in tents which were furnished by the National Guard, more of them lived. [...] If <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> into bed {{in the early stages of}} the disease the chances of living were far better. [...] If they stayed around for two or three days, and finally went to bed, because they couldn't do anything else—they would very likely die." ...|$|E
2500|$|We {{took the}} prisoners {{to the high}} hills above Evin. They were blind-folded and their hands were tied. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> off the minibus and had them sit on the ground. Then, Attarpour told them that, just as your friends have killed our comrades, we have decided to execute you—the brain behind those executions. Jazani and the others began protesting. I {{do not know whether}} it was Attarpour or Colonel Vaziri who first pulled out a machine gun and started {{shooting}} them. I do not remember whether I was the 4th or 5th person to whom they gave the machine gun. I had never done that before. At the end, Sa'di Jalil Esfahani [...] shot them in their heads [...]|$|E

6000|$|Possibly a second, or, at most, two seconds, {{she gazed}} at this, when she was aroused by Bert's voice. He was running along the sidewalk, {{in front of her}} house, and behind him charged several more strikers, while he shouted: [...] "Come on, you Mohegans! <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>'em</b> nailed to the cross!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "When I {{was twenty}} years old, {{we went to}} the Crows and stole a lot of horses. [...] The Crows {{discovered}} us and followed us all night. [...] When daylight came we saw them behind us. [...] I was the leader. [...] We turned back to fight the Crows. [...] I killed one and took his scalp and a field glass and a Crow necklace from him. [...] We chased the others back a long way and then caught up with our own men again and went on. [...] It was a very cold winter. [...] There were twenty of us and each had four horses. [...] <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> home all right and it was a good trip that time. [...] We had a scalp dance when we got back." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> {{surrounded}} {{the fight was}} over in one hour. There was so much dust we could not see much, but the Indians rode around and yelled the war-whoop and shot into the soldiers {{as fast as they}} could until they were all dead. One soldier was running away to the east but Crazy Horse saw him and jumped on his pony and went after him. He got him about half a mile from the place where the other soldiers were lying dead. The smoke was lifted so we could see a little. We got off our horses and went and took the rings and money and watches from the soldiers. We took some clothes off too, and all the guns and pistols. We got seven hundred guns and pistols. Then we went back to the women and children and got them together that were not killed or hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|With this team, EG Management {{financed the}} {{recording}} of the tracks for their first album, Roxy Music, recorded in March–April 1972 and produced by King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield. Both the album and its famous cover artwork were apparently completed before the group signed with Island Records. A staffer Tim Clark records that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them, company boss Chris Blackwell at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested. A few days later however, Clark and Enthoven {{were standing in the}} hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past, glanced at the artwork and said [...] "Looks great! Have <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> signed yet?" [...] The band signed with Island Records a few days later. The LP was released in June to good reviews and became a major success, reaching No.10 on the UK album chart in September 1972.|$|E

But {{you know}} what he said--there would be a small fortune in it for us if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>'em.</b> He says he's got some papers --or a map I guess it is--but he wants these papers, too. He didn't dare show himself around here--you know the reason why." ...|$|R

2500|$|The game {{engine of}} DOA5 was built from scratch. To better balance the {{fighting}} system, Team Ninja decided to re-examine {{each of the}} characters, creating new moves from scratch when needed and carefully refining others. According to Hayashi, the entire project's main concept was a decision to change direction and {{to focus on the}} characters' presence instead of on their beauty as in the previous games. They aimed to retain the characters' personalities and characteristics but to make them more lifelike and appealing for the players. In October 2011, the series' official Facebook page announced a contest inviting fans to create and submit their own fighting moves, some of which would be used in DOA5 and their creators would have their names displayed in the game's credits. Regarding an introduction of playable guest characters from the Virtua Fighter series, the characters' key animations were provided by Sega and Team Ninja created some more while working to implement them into the Dead or Alive gameplay system, which uses similar controls but features a different kind of matches. Hayashi said Team Ninja stayed in [...] "very close" [...] communication with Sega AM2: [...] "We got their guidance and feedback, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> to check for everything we were doing with the characters." [...] Hasayshi also said that he aimed to develop a crossover game {{in a manner similar to}} Street Fighter X Tekken and that he chose Virtua Fighter because it was [...] "the father of 3D gaming", and also the first 3D game that he played and the IP he personally respects most.|$|E

5000|$|Levine was a post-doc with Walter Gehring in Switzerland from 1982 to 1983. [...] There, he co-discovered the {{homeobox}} with Ernst Hafen {{and fellow}} post-doc William McGinnis:After learning that Ultrabithorax, {{a gene that}} specifies the development of wings, showed a localized pattern of expression {{similar to that of}} Antennapedia, they decided to revisit the classic papers of Ed Lewis. In 1978, Lewis had proposed that all these homeotic genes (the ones that tell animals where to put a wing and where to put a leg and so on) arose from a common ancestral gene. So McGinnis carved up the Antennapedia gene and, using those pieces as probes, the trio identified eight genes, {{which turned out to be}} the eight homeotic genes in flies. [...] "That pissed off a lot of people," [...] says Levine. [...] "The homeotic genes were the trophies of the Drosophila genome. And <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>'em</b> all. I mean, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>'em</b> all!" [...] Far from being humble, Levine says, [...] "We were like, 'We kicked your ass pretty good, didn't we, baby!' Those were the days." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{required}} {{a great deal}} of tugging and lifting to get those three men on the bench, but <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> there side by side, their heads hanging listlessly, some one way, some another. I then tied each one of them firmly to the bench.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, Mrs. Rasselyer-Brown," [...] cried a loud, firm {{voice from}} the sidewalk. [...] "We have them both.

"It is a princely present, Sir Robert," [...] Edgar said, [...] "and, indeed, a most timely one, for truly we have well-nigh {{grown out}} of the other suits, {{although}} when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> it seemed {{to us that we}} should never be able to fill them properly; but of late we have been forced to ease the straps, and to leave spaces between the pieces, by which lance or arrow might well find entrance." ...|$|E
60|$|Sam and I {{went after}} {{sailfish}} at Long Key and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them.</b> But I {{do not consider}} the experience conclusive. If {{it had not been}} for my hard-earned knowledge of the Pacific swordfish, and for Sam's keenness on the sea, we would not have been so fortunate. We established the record, but, what is more important, we showed what magnificent sport is possible. This advent added much to the attractiveness of Long Key for me. And Long Key was attractive enough before.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> fixed at last, {{and then}} all {{that was to be}} done was to arrange the {{covering}} over them. George unrolled it, and fastened one end over the nose of the boat. Harris stood in the middle to take it from George and roll it on to me, and I kept by the stern to receive it. It was a long time coming down to me. George did his part all right, but it was new work to Harris, and he bungled it.|$|E
5000|$|Jac Holzman stated:"I {{loved that}} group. They were a {{fascinating}} group, a wonderful band, and I thought the records were wonderful. I think our mistake was not {{bringing them to}} the States, because they really needed {{to get out of}} England. There was too much other stuff competing in England, and in the States, we might have had an easier time. I don't know why we didn't bring 'em. I think, had <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>'em</b> the right venues and gotten them some help with their show, it would have worked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, George, <b>we</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>'em.</b> <b>We</b> couldn't hold such a quantity. And {{if we had}} them, {{we should}} be ruined to sell them at such prices as that. I did {{want to do a}} genuine trade in stockings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I reckon on that, and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>them</b> {{twelve feet}} deep. It {{will be a}} job {{to get them out}} as we want them, but there won't be {{anything}} else to do and it will keep us in health." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{made a list}} of {{the things}} to be taken, and a pretty lengthy one it was, before we parted that evening. The next day, which was Friday, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> all together, and met in the evening to pack. We got a big Gladstone for the clothes, and a couple of hampers for the victuals and the cooking utensils. We moved the table up against the window, piled {{everything}} in a heap {{in the middle of the}} floor, and sat round and looked at it.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a dreadful}} sight {{and one of}} which I never saw the like. Nor to this day do I know why the deed was done, unless perhaps the women were sworn {{to the service of}} the new queen and feared that if they failed to protect her, they would be doomed to some awful end. At any rate <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> out dead or dying, for their blows had been strong and true, and not one of them lived {{for more than a few}} minutes.|$|E
6000|$|At {{times we}} led the beasts out in {{detachments}} to water at wayside stations, {{and there was}} usually much profanity and destruction of property before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>them</b> back again, and left the agent to assess the damage to his feelings, besides splintered gangways and broken rails. It was at Portage or Brandon, I think, that one showed me a warning received by wire. [...] "Through freight full of wild beasts coming along.
