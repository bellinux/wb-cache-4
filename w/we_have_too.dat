As {{soon as you get}} away from the frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from this or any other sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E
500|$|Although she {{believed}} that rearing the family was a shared responsibility between men and women, Spafford was cautious in both her words and actions to not fully support or endorse the women's rights movements of the 1970s. In 1972, she stated, [...] "Anything that gets out of control becomes a hazard, whether it's fire, flood, or women's lib". She {{went on to say}} that [...] "we want to preserve the nobility, dignity, and femininity of women; there's a danger of some of that being lost. But I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>too</b> many common-sense women for that to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{writing in}} The Atlantic, {{a year after}} Carr, the {{futurist}} Jamais Cascio argued that human cognition has always evolved to meet environmental challenges, and that those posed by the internet are no different. He described the 'skimming' referred to by Carr {{as a form of}} attention deficit caused by the immaturity of filter algorithms: [...] "The trouble isn’t that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>too</b> much information at our fingertips, but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy... many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help us get some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn’t the problem; it’s the beginning of a solution." [...] Cascio and Carr's articles have been discussed together in several places. Pew Research used them to form a tension-pair question survey that was distributed to noted academics. Most responded in detail; concurring with the proposition [...] "Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid". In The Googlisation of Everything, Vaidhyanathan tended to side with Carr. However, he thought both arguments relied too much on determinism: Carr in thinking that an over-reliance on internet tools will inevitably cause the brain to atrophy, and Cascio in thinking that getting smarter is the necessary outcome of the evolutionary pressures he describes. In From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg Naughton noted that, while many agreed Carr had hit on an important subject, his conclusions were not widely supported.|$|E
