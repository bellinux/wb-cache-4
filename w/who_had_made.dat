5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made {{it impossible}} to determine <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> the first kill, which would be the first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war.

The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the hostility}} with which Candaules was met on its exhibition, it {{was bought by}} Robert Vernon, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a fortune {{supplying}} horses to the military and was using the proceeds to amass a major art collection.

5|$|His fortune changed, however, {{when the}} country was invaded in 1326 by Mortimer, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> common cause with the king's wife, Queen Isabella. Immediately after the capture of Edward II, the queen, Edward III's regent, ordered Arundel executed, his title forfeit and his {{property}} confiscated. Arundel's son and heir Richard only recovered the title and lands in 1331, after Edward III had taken power from the regency of Isabella and Mortimer. In the 1390s, a cult emerged around the late earl. He was venerated as a martyr, though he was never canonised.|$|E
