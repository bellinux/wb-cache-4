5|$|A <b>waterspout</b> is a {{columnar}} vortex forming {{over water}} that is, {{in its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a cumuliform cloud. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Waterspouts</b> are {{not known}} for inflicting much damage {{because they are not}} {{commonly}} exposed to land, but they are capable of traveling over land. Some <b>waterspouts</b> are known to produce hurricane-strength winds and are capable of producing equivalent damage. Vegetation, weakly constructed buildings, and other infrastructure may be destroyed by <b>waterspouts.</b> Automobiles may be lifted by advancing <b>waterspouts.</b> Heavy precipitation may be noted, developed from the water raised by the wind currents. <b>Waterspouts</b> do not generally last long over terrestrial environments as the friction produced easily dissipates the winds. Strong horizontal winds cause <b>waterspouts</b> to dissipate, destroying the concentration of the updrafts. While not generally as dangerous as [...] "classic" [...] tornadoes, <b>waterspouts</b> can overturn boats, and they can cause severe damage to larger ships.|$|R
5|$|<b>Waterspouts</b> {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as serious marine hazards. Stronger <b>waterspouts</b> pose threats to watercraft, aircraft and people. It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be on alert through weather reports. The United States National Weather Service will often issue special marine warnings when <b>waterspouts</b> are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when <b>waterspouts</b> are expected to move onshore.|$|R
5|$|While <b>waterspouts</b> form {{mostly in}} the tropics and {{subtropical}} areas, other areas also report <b>waterspouts,</b> including Europe, New Zealand, the Great Lakes, Antarctica and on rare occasions, the Great Salt Lake. Although rare, <b>waterspouts</b> have been observed in connection with lake-effect snow precipitation bands.|$|R
5|$|A <b>waterspout</b> is {{an intense}} {{columnar}} vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a <b>waterspout</b> that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The <b>waterspout</b> eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} <b>waterspout</b> {{can occur in}} the same {{vicinity}} at the same time. As many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on Lake Michigan. The illustration on the left, by James Pollard Espy in 1841, shows {{the manner in which}} one spout, while forming, tends to generate others in its neighborhood.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Waterspouts</b> {{that are}} not {{associated}} with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm are known as [...] "non-tornadic" [...] or [...] "fair-weather waterspouts", and {{are by far the}} most common type. Fair-weather <b>waterspouts</b> occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective cumulus towers. <b>Waterspouts</b> of this type rapidly develop and dissipate, having life cycles shorter than 20 minutes. [...] They usually rate no higher than EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, generally exhibiting winds of less than 30 m/s.|$|R
50|$|Though the {{majority}} of <b>waterspouts</b> occur in the tropics, they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout the world, and are common across the western coast of Europe {{as well as the}} British Isles and several areas of the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea. They are not restricted to saltwater; many have been reported on lakes and rivers including the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. <b>Waterspouts</b> are fairly common on the Great Lakes during late summer and early fall, with a record 66+ <b>waterspouts</b> reported over just a seven-day period in 2003. They are more frequent within 100 kilometers (60 mi) from the coast than farther out at sea. <b>Waterspouts</b> are common along the southeast U.S. coast, especially off southern Florida and the Keys and can happen over seas, bays, and lakes worldwide. Approximately 160 <b>waterspouts</b> are currently reported per year across Europe, with the Netherlands reporting the most at 60, followed by Spain and Italy at 25, and the United Kingdom at 15. They are most common in late summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, September has been pinpointed as the prime month of formation. <b>Waterspouts</b> are frequently observed off the east coast of Australia, with several being described by Joseph Banks during the voyage of the Endeavour in 1770.|$|R
25|$|<b>Waterspouts</b> are tornadoes {{that form}} over water.|$|R
5|$|Upon making landfall, Tropical Storm Grace {{produced}} a light storm surge of 3.5feet (1m) in Matagorda and North Jetty, Texas. Wind gusts peaked at 53mph (85km/h) with sustained winds of 40mph (64km/h) at Sea Rim State Park. Locations closer {{to where the}} storm made landfall reported below tropical storm force winds, {{with the exception of}} Galveston which recorded a 40mph (64km/h) wind gust. Rainfall was moderate to heavy across eastern Texas, peaking at 10.36inches (263mm) in Spindletop Bayou. The outer bands of Grace spawned a <b>waterspout</b> just south of the western tip of Galveston Island, prompting the issuance of a tornado warning. The <b>waterspout</b> dissipated before moving onshore. The storm also caused light beach erosion, though little occurred beyond the erosion caused by Hurricane Claudette one month prior. Near the coast, high tides from the storm flooded piers, bulkheads, and low-lying areas. Further inland, heavy rainfall lead to flash flooding, covering roads and entering a few houses. Overall, damage was minor, and totaled to $113,000 (2003USD, $147,100 2016USD).|$|E
5|$|Incidents of waterspouts causing {{severe damage}} and {{casualties}} are rare. However, {{there have been}} several notable examples. The Malta tornado in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly <b>waterspout.</b> It struck the Grand Harbour of Valletta, sinking four galleys, numerous boats, and claiming hundreds of lives. The 1851 Sicily Tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western Sicily, ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and <b>waterspout.</b> Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.|$|E

5|$|Bonnie {{triggered}} a tornado outbreak throughout {{portions of the}} Mid-Atlantic states. One tornado in Pender County, North Carolina destroyed 17homes and damaged 59houses, causing three deaths and $1.27million in damage (2004USD). In Stella, Bonnie generated a <b>waterspout</b> that struck a campground, damaged nine trailers, and wrecked small boats. A tornado in Richlands damaged several houses as well. In South Carolina, tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes. A suspected tornado in Danville, Virginia destroyed the roofs of several businesses. In South Carolina, rainfall peaking at 6.07inches (154mm) in Loris caused flooding across the state. The flooding, including a one-foot depth along U.S. Route 501, washed away a road and a bridge in Greenville County. In addition, 600people across the state were left without electricity.|$|E
5|$|Gale force {{winds and}} heavy {{rainfall}} {{were reported in}} the lower Florida Keys; Key West reported 6.25inches (160mm) during a 24-hour period, with the maximum reported winds at a land station being 70mph (115km/h) in the Dry Tortugas. Moderate rainfall was reported throughout southern Florida and the eastern Florida Keys, as well, peaking at 16.47inches (418mm) at Tavernier. Alberto spawned three tornadoes and a <b>waterspout</b> in the Florida Keys, one of which at Stock Island which damaged several boats. One of the three tornadoes picked up a moving car and lightly injured the driver. Another knocked down two telephone poles on the Overseas Highway, which resulted in an hour traffic delay. Damage from the tornadoes totaled $275,000 (1982USD, $620,000 2010USD).|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was reported}} along the Florida Panhandle, peaking at over 10inches (254mm) {{in the extreme}} northwestern portion of the state. The rainfall caused the worst flooding in tenyears, and resulted in additional flooding to the already swollen Coldwater Creek and Blackwater River in Santa Rosa County. Near the river, 30homes were destroyed with an additional 50houses damaged, totaling about $320,000 (1988USD, $560,000 2007USD) in damage. Several roads were closed from the flooding, as well. The strong convective band associated with Florence extended across the Florida Panhandle, spawning nine tornadoes in Walton County and one <b>waterspout</b> in Bay County. Damage from the tornadoes amounted to about $100,000 (1988USD, $175,000 2007USD).|$|E

5|$|Since it {{initially}} moved little, Bret brought prolonged overcast {{conditions to}} much of the northern Bahamas, with most of the activity over the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. An estimated 3 in (75mm) of precipitation fell in Abaco over the weekend of July 1617. In addition, a weather station on the island reported gale-force gusting of up to 48mph (77km/h) {{at the height of the}} storm. The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match. Outer rainbands spawned a <b>waterspout</b> that touched down on eastern Paradise Island, accompanied by lightning strikes and torrents. Nevertheless, locals considered the storm's impact to be generally positive, as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across the nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{squall line}} finally overtook the supercells {{just after midnight}} on March2, after putting down 37 tornadoes that day. As the squall line overtook the cells, a few tornadoes — all EF0 — took place {{overnight}} in Florida and extreme southern Georgia within the squall line, before the severe weather emerged in the Atlantic Ocean that morning. The final tornado was a landfalling <b>waterspout</b> in the Outer Banks of North Carolina late that morning. In addition to the tornadoes, widespread straight-line wind damage from microbursts were also reported, along with scattered large hail, the largest of which were the size of baseballs.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a <b>waterspout),</b> tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav passed just {{to the east of}} Cape Hatteras, areas of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia {{experienced}} heavy rain and tropical storm force winds. Parts of the Outer Banks received 2–5inches (50–125mm) of rain and winds of up to 50mph (80km/h), and the Coast Guard station at Cape Hatteras reported a wind gust of 78mph (125km/h). The storm produced storm surges of 3– along the Outer Banks, and 1– along the southeastern coast of Virginia. These surges, combined with strong winds and high sea swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and Hatteras Village, North Carolina. A weak <b>waterspout</b> also touched down on Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was reported. Sporadic power outages were also reported. One person died after suffering injuries in the high surf, and 40 other people had to be rescued from riptides and storm surges. Damage in the region amounted to $100,000 (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe <b>waterspout</b> strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|Power outages were {{reported}} throughout Central and North Florida, with over 93,300customers losing electricity, including about 9,500power outages between Tampa and Temple Terrace. In several counties, such as Alachua, Bradford, Duval, Flagler, Hardee, Martin, Orange, Putnam, and St. Lucie, impact was primarily limited to falling trees, which blocked roads, knocked down some power lines, or left generally minor damage to homes and vehicles. A few tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned during a storm. A <b>waterspout</b> was spotted offshore Lee County near Bonita Springs and Estero. An EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale touched down near Jacksonville. The tornado snapped {{a number of}} pine and hardwood trees, while causing roof damage to some homes. At a Publix distribution center, three empty trucks were overturned. A possible tornado in Alachua County {{in the vicinity of}} Hawthorne toppled some trees and damaged a home.|$|E
