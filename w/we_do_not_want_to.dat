500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E
500|$|Robey {{returned}} to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took {{a leading role in}} another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion {{from one side of the}} auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic." [...] Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.|$|E

500|$|Wipeout Pulse was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis). Colin Berry, the lead designer of the game, stated {{in an interview that}} the team had received a lot of positive feedback from Wipeout Pure, and was willing to use parts of the feedback to [...] "help shape some elements of Pulse". According to Berry, some people had felt that the previous game was too difficult; the ships were considered too fast and the artificial intelligence (AI) too advanced, whereas others thought that the game was too easy and they wanted [...] "something more challenging to keep them coming back". The development team also took steps to decrease the feeling of repetition, which was often cited as one of the main complaints of Wipeout Pure. In addition, the team altered the game's difficulty settings so that players were given the choice to change the speed of the game at any time, in the event that they [...] "got stuck". Reflecting on this, Berry said: [...] "We want the people who buy it, to see all the game, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> lock them out".|$|E
500|$|Morale on the {{battlefield}} was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know {{who was willing to}} fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, [...] "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon." [...] In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that [...] "we are not traitors, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be aggressors." ...|$|E

He also felt that the storyline of putting Jack on TGS with Tracy Jordan was [...] "fun", but thought [...] "that for some reason fell a bit flat". Tom Shales of The Washington Post felt that [...] "30 Rock had [...] "consistently and considerably improved since its premiere". He praised Alec Baldwin, whose performance he described as [...] "rare and rich [...] perilously close to perfect, beyond improving". Shales said that it was [...] "painful to report" [...] that Jack McBrayer was absent in the episode, saying he was [...] "the show's brightest discovery", and his [...] "performance has been a bittersweet beauty". Rob Canning of IGN said that 30 Rocks was [...] "one new comedy <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see taken off the air". He said that [...] "Jack-Tor" [...] had him [...] "laughing from every angle", and may have [...] "begun a debate as to which character is more fun to watch– Jack Donaghy or Tracy Jordan?". He said that the outtakes of Jack's sketch were [...] "one of the best parts of the episode", and that Tracy was evolving into his own [...] "uniquely hilarious character". Overall, he felt that Jack was winning the [...] "comedy showdown".|$|E

Using well-known techniques of model theory, one can construct a nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory (nothing nearly as strong as full ZFC is needed for the basic technique) on which there is an external automorphism j (not a set of the model) which moves a rank [...] of the cumulative hierarchy of sets.

2500|$|The Nukak {{have already}} {{suffered}} {{the devastation of}} their population by malaria, measles and pulmonary diseases since their contact with the New Tribes Mission and other outsiders beginning in 1981; now, coca growers, left-wing FARC guerillas, right-wing AUC paramilitaries and the Colombian army have occupied their lands. These aboriginals have therefore become embroiled in Colombia's armed conflict. In 2006, a group of nearly 80 Nukak left the jungle and sought assimilation along with cultural preservation. As one of the migrants, Pia-pe, put it: [...] "We do {{want to join the}} white family, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> forget words of the Nukak." [...] In October 2006, leader and Nukak Spanish speaker Maw-be' committed suicide by drinking poison; friends and the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) described him as in desperation in his inability to secure supplies or a safe return to their homeland for the Nukak.|$|E
2500|$|Demmin's current chronicler, then 14 years old, recalls:My {{mother was}} also raped. And then, {{together}} {{with us and}} with neighbors, she hurried towards the Tollense river, resolutely prepared to jump into it. [...] My siblings [...] realized only much later that I had held her back, that I had pulled her out {{of what may be}} called a state of trance, to prevent her from jumping into the water. There were people. There was screaming. The people were prepared to die. Children were told: 'Do you want to live on? The town is burning. These and those are dead already. No, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live any more.' And so, people went mostly into the rivers. [...] That made even the Russians feel creepy. There are examples where Russians, too, tried to pull people out or hinder them. But these hundreds of people, they were unable to withhold. And the population here was extremely panicked.|$|E
2500|$|On April 3, the IDF {{deployed}} tanks near Manger Square, {{opposite the}} church, and Israeli Army snipers took up {{positions on the}} surrounding buildings. They were instructed to fire at anyone spotted inside the church, searching out targets with laser beams. The Israeli government said it regarded the militants' use of holy sites as cynical and claimed that the militants had shot at the Israeli troops from the church. IDF spokesman, Brigadier General Ron Kitri, said: [...] "It is complicated {{because it is a}} sacred place and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use live ammunition. There are several channels of negotiation to try to achieve as close to a peaceful solution as possible". Michel Sabbah, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem {{and the head of the}} Roman Catholic Church in the region, said the gunmen had been given sanctuary, and that [...] "the basilica is a place of refuge for everybody, even fighters, as long as they lay down their arms. We have an obligation to give refuge to Palestinians and Israelis alike". The IDF placed its headquarters in a Palestinian convention center named the [...] "Peace Center".|$|E

2500|$|From {{relatively}} {{early in}} his professional career, Lowell worried {{about the role of}} racial and ethnic minorities in American society. As early as 1887, he wrote of the Irish: [...] "What we need is not to dominate the Irish, but to absorb them.... We want them to become rich, and send their sons to our colleges, to share our prosperity and our sentiments. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> feel that they are among us and yet not really part of us." [...] He believed that only a homogeneous society could safeguard the achievements of American democracy. Sometime before 1906, he became an honorary vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, an organization that promoted literacy tests and tightened enforcement of immigration laws. In 1910, he wrote approvingly in private of excluding Chinese immigrants entirely and of Southern states that denied the franchise to black citizens. Publicly he consistently adopted assimilation as the solution to absorbing other groups, limiting their numbers to levels he believed would allow American society to absorb them without being changed itself, a stance that [...] "fused liberal and racist ideas in making the case for exclusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 21, 2016, Gerardo {{was arrested}} by the National Police of Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was arrested {{following}} an extensive money laundering investigation between Latin American officials and the U.S. government that linked him to several shell companies he used to purchase assets in the Americas and overseas. This information was discovered in 2015 through the massive information leak known as the Panama Papers. Following his arrest, Tobares' family spoke {{to the press and}} talked about the investigation. They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, but they said that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused. [...] "We just want to know where he is so we can bring him home, with his people, with his friends he loved and loved him. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know who took him. We just want to know, even anonymously, where he is," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday, October 11, 2007 Texas A {{officials}} {{issued a}} [...] "letter of admonishment" [...] and ordered that the website CoachFran.com be shut down. Additionally, Franchione {{was instructed to}} no longer employ [...] "any staff members that {{could be construed as}} representing Texas A or providing information or reports relative to his position as head coach at Texas A". Consequently, the university fired McKenzie. Byrne has been quoted as saying [...] "The Aggies are embarrassed right now. This has been a very unfortunate incident <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> experience again." [...] Byrne also stated that the incident would be included in Franchione's performance evaluation {{at the end of the}} season. The discovery of the newsletter led CBS Sports columnist Gregg Doyel to call for Franchione to be fired. Doyel wrote that many of Franchione's columns announced firings of assistant coaches before that assistant was told himself and reported injuries that weren't disclosed to the press. [...] More seriously, Doyel said, his disclosures of injury information violated federal health privacy law, and the entire venture would have also violated federal tax law if Franchione hadn't told the IRS about it. He also suggested that Franchione may have known the newsletter's recipients were using the information to make better-informed bets on Aggie games.|$|E
