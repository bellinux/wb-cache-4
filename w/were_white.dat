5000|$|The question, what is being, {{is seeking}} {{an answer to}} {{something}} [...] "that is." [...] A contemporary example in rhetoric would be {{to look at a}} color. Using white as an example, when we define a color, we define it by association. Snow <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> Paper <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> A cow <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> But what <b>is</b> <b>white?</b> While we <b>are</b> saying things that <b>are</b> <b>white,</b> we <b>are</b> not defining what <b>white</b> <b>is</b> without qualification. Ousia is thus {{the answer to the question}} of [...] "what is being" [...] when the question is without qualification. The unqualified answer of what <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>is</b> the ousia of white.|$|R
