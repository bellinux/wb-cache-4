500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> she has to say and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E
500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> ... <b>what</b> characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can stand the test of time with such confidence".|$|E
2500|$|The Subways {{appeared}} {{during the}} [...] of the third season of The O.C., [...] "The Anger Management", performing two songs at the music venue 'the Bait Shop', [...] "Rock & Roll Queen" [...] and [...] "Oh Yeah". The episode {{came to a close}} with [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>What</b> You Have Got to Say" [...] playing.|$|E
60|$|Denis {{shook his}} head. He hated talking at breakfast, and, besides, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Scogan was saying {{at the other}} end of the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What is it?' says I. 'Theft, murder, rape, or what?' I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> {{he would}} have to say for himself, though of course I {{expected}} it would be some sort of lie. But all he said was-- ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the other}} end of the porch, close under a window, was an offset between step and wall, and there in the shadow I hid. If Sampson or Wright visited the girls that evening I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> was said about Steele.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2015 his {{autobiography}} entitled Over the Top and Back: The Autobiography {{was published by}} Michael Joseph. Reviewing the book in the Daily Express, Clair Woodward said, [...] "In the tradition of so many autobiographies these days, Tom Jones's doesn't {{tell you what you}} really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> ... <b>What</b> you are left with is a riotously enjoyable story of Jones 'The Voice' which nicely doubles as the story of British pop and light entertainment from the Sixties onwards." ...|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE. No, David, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> is {{to become}} of me; I promise not to take any side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on {{with your}} story, Hare," [...] I repeated. [...] "You are {{becoming}} metaphysical and therefore dull. The time is short and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shan't {{trouble you}} for a long time," [...] the young man went on. He made a step towards the door, but he stopped. [...] "Another reason why I came was that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> you would say in {{explanation}} of your having changed your mind." ...|$|R
60|$|The triviality of {{the dinner}} had been in those two minutes dwarfed and drowned in my mind. I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go and see a {{political}} widow, and a captain who collected apes; I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> had brought this dear, doddering old vicar into relation with immediate perils.|$|R
40|$|This {{interview}} {{took place}} on the back porch of her house. It was laid back and she gave me coffee to drink. She was also more interested in asking me questions about who I am than actually getting interviewed. She told me that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> I had <b>to</b> say and didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> listen about what she had to say...|$|R
6000|$|The host laughed. [...] "I {{prefer not}} to take the floor. I'm sure we all <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> you have to say in support of your mammoth idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did {{not expect}} you would. I know you too well; but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> you have been doing--what he said,' {{answered}} Charles, in short, impatient sentences.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{she said}} firmly, [...] "Klara {{shall not be}} silent, Andor. Let go her arm and let her speak. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> she has to say." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{also has}} written some new songs: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> these musicians {{would do with}} them; I was {{inviting}} them into my world as I stepped into theirs. As a result the modern songs have a real traditional thread going through them, making it all hopefully ... just music not labelled folk or contemporary or singer-songwriter or jazz!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I don't know as I'd betta," [...] she faltered. But {{she saw the}} box {{under his}} arm, and she thought that he wished {{to speak to her}} about that, and she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> he would say. She had been waiting at the door there, because she could not bear to go to her room without having {{something}} more happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn’t get you clothes, no, not {{for fifty}} pun," [...] {{said the man}} severely. [...] "Wot d’yer mean <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> spoil people’s {{pleasure}} in that way? Come on, come and tell the cap’n what you’ve got for ’im, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>’ear</b> <b>what</b> he ses. He’s been swearing ’ard since ten o’clock this morning, but he ought to say something special over this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Awfully. But {{the point}} is that now he's gone I can tell you about that M.C.C. match affair. I know you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> really did happen that afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> {{they are}} saying," [...] said Songbird. [...] "I {{have a special}} reason." [...] And at Max's look of {{surprise}} he told something of what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mabel and I will go over too, James," [...] Mrs. Withers said; [...] "we cannot sit quiet all {{day after}} this excitement. Beside, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Tallboys says." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It's {{this type}} of {{integrity}} and fair-mindedness that make it hard not to like Smith, 31, no matter your political persuasion. He speaks in measured tones. He pulls back when necessary and listens. He's the married father of three little kids, who {{had a crush on}} his wife of six years, Suzy, back in high school in Londonderry, and who genuinely <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> you think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not be displeased," [...] I said, and as I spoke I seated myself {{beside her}} on the stone. She made no objections. I think she was too much {{agitated}} even to notice it. [...] "I had no intention of keeping anything from you, but I first <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> you had <b>to</b> tell me. Sylvia did not tell me everything, nor have you." ...|$|R
50|$|George Fox, {{the founder}} of the Religious Society of Friends, {{commonly}} known as the Quakers, came to Cornwall in 1656. He was arrested several times for blasphemy because his ideas were at odds with mainstream Christianity at the time. However people <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> he had <b>to</b> say and a group met regularly from 1680. They wanted a simple place in which to meet, and built a cob-and-thatch meeting house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{a matter}} of course,' said Charles, in a sharp, quick manner, his voice full of suffering. 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> you have been doing at Oxford and St. Mildred's.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will all}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> {{you have to}} tell, Major," [...] {{the head of the}} staff said. [...] "You had best go into the mess tent, and hold a durbar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> you've {{got to tell}} too," [...] said Dora, with a merry laugh. She {{was looking}} {{straight}} into Dick's eyes. [...] "Have {{you had a good}} time at the Hall?" ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{traditional}} region in Egypt, farmers started participating in Farmer Field Schools (FFS) to receive training on pest management. When women facilitators were recruited, some women-only field schools started, while later even mixed schools emerged. The topics discussed slowly moved beyond agriculture {{to health and}} reproductive issues, rights and literacy. "My husband never listened to me. Now he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> I learned during the training sessions. ...|$|R

50|$|Juan Carlos {{then decided}} to include his wife Evelyn Herrera as a new member of Tercer Cielo, arousing great curiosity in the artistic and Christian world. Many fans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the {{seriousness}} of the new project. The idea, for many, was strange, because they believed that Tercer Cielo was over, {{but at the same time}} were interested because they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> the new musical style would be like. Tercer Cielo was now something completely different and their expectations were great.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now the whisker on {{the other}} side. Turn him over!" [...] Between match and razor this, too, was removed. [...] "Give him his shaving-glass. Take the gag out. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> he'll say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will go with}} you," [...] I answered, [...] "and wait in the {{carriage}} at the door. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> has passed between you and Mrs. Van Brandt the instant you have left her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go to hell!" [...] replied Calvin, {{as he rode}} past him. [...] "I'm no nigger. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> goes on, and I tell ye {{right now}} you treat these people fair or you'll hear from me." ...|$|E

60|$|The clerk went out, {{knowing why}} he had been sent. His {{employer}} trusted him where he was forced, but did not <b>want</b> him <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> Drummond had <b>to</b> say.|$|R
500|$|Prior to the 2008 presidential election, Cryer {{attended}} a fundraiser {{hosted by the}} McCain campaign and, according to news reports, endorsed Senator John McCain.
