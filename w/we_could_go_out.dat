500|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled {{anonymously}} {{with the}} celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E

6000|$|SIR WILLIAM. What! It's ruin. We've {{always been}} here. Who the deuce are we {{if we leave}} this place? D'you think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> stay? <b>Go</b> <b>out</b> and meet {{everybody}} just {{as if nothing had}} happened? Good-bye to any prestige, political, social, or anything! This is the sort of business nothing can get over. I've seen it before. As to that other matter--it's soon forgotten--constantly happening--Why, my own grandfather----! ...|$|R
60|$|This sign hung triumphantly {{for several}} days, when one morning, {{just as we}} had {{finished}} breakfast, we were surprised to hear the stage stop at the door, and before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to see who had arrived, into the room came our own stage-driver, {{as we used to}} call him. He had actually left his team to come and see us.|$|E
6000|$|... "But if we do," [...] he said, [...] "I think we'd better ship {{them on a}} tug and {{let them}} cruise around the Lightship {{for two or three}} days. Then when they hoisted a signal that they were all well on board, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and take them off. In that way, you see, they'd really enjoy a cruise on the Summer Shelter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yuh. Gee! it's a big place. Say, that Westminster Abbey's a great place. I was {{in there}} a couple of times. More darn tombs of kings and stuff. And I see a bishop, with leggins on! But I got kind of lonely. I thought of {{you a lot of}} times. Wished <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and get an ale together. Maybe pick up a couple of pretty girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that it is settled; we have had one day at each of the sports. Rabah said that to-morrow <b>we</b> <b>could</b> either <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and see new modes of fishing, or {{accompany}} the fowlers and watch them catching birds in the clap nets, or <b>go</b> <b>out</b> into the desert and hunt ibex. Chebron did not decide, but I suppose when he has finished his letter we shall hear what he intends to do." ...|$|R

500|$|Following pilot {{training}} in the United Kingdom, Drummond received the rank of temporary second lieutenant and was attached to No.1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps, which was based in Egypt.

I told 'em I'd go myself an' see him about it but they said no, I couldn't, for if they did that way everybody who ever was sent here would be goin' out the next day to see about leavin'. I didn't want to make no fuss, so I told them I'd write a letter to the doctor and tell him to send an order that would soon show them whether <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> or not. They said that would be the best thing to do, an so I'm goin' to write it this minute,'--which he did.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{some days}} {{we got along}} well; the blacks poled thar best, and every evening we just hit a pint where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> into the stream agin. Two or three times we fancied we war watched, for we heard the {{snapping}} of twigs, and sounds in the thick swamp jungle ahead; but I reckon they thowt better of it when they saw two rifle-barrels peeping out from the sacks on each side, and saw we war ready for a tussle. But one day--it wasn't very far from the pint where we mended up that boat the other day--we war later than usual; the stream war stronger than we reckoned on, we had run aground {{two or three times}} on the mud, and it war getting dark, and we had two miles yet before we got to a place where we could get out into the river. The blacks war working thar hardest; it didn't need no words from us to keep 'em at it, for they knew as well as we did what was the danger, and the boat just flew along that narrow channel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have ridden {{in to get}} help. The {{other day}} a raiding party of Boers came down through Inadi, and riding in between Dingley Dell and Botha's Castle--you know the hill--swept off a {{quantity}} of cattle. They have not penetrated so far before, and no one about {{thought that there was}} any danger while you were attacking them up here. One of the farmers rode to Greytown for help. Most of the young men there had joined one or other of the colonial troops, but fifteen of us said that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> It seemed that there were not more than some fifteen or twenty Boers. Well, I can't tell you all about it, for, as {{it is a matter of}} life and death, I have not a moment to lose. However, we came up to them north of Botha's Castle. We had a sharp fight. Two of our men were killed and five of the Boers; the rest rode off. We set to work to bunch all the cattle, and as we were at it we were attacked suddenly by a party sixty or seventy strong. The fellows that we had driven off had evidently come across them and brought them down upon us. We made a running fight, but our horses were not so fresh as theirs; and seeing that they had the speed of us we made for an empty farmhouse, and as they rode up we brought down several of them.|$|E

60|$|I {{will begin}} with that Twelfth-day morning when we were wakened by more noise and racket than even Paris could {{generally}} produce. There {{had been a little}} tumult about once a week for the last six months, so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> endure a great deal, but this was plainly a much larger one. Some of the servants who <b>went</b> <b>out</b> brought word that the Queen had carried off the King in order to be revenged on Paris, and that the people, in a rage, were breaking the carriages of her suite to pieces, plundering the wagons, and beating, if not killing, every one in them. We were of course mightily troubled for my sister, and being only two women <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in quest of her, while each rumour we heard was more terrible than the last. Some even said that the Louvre had been asked and plundered; but old Sir Andrew Macniven, who had made his way through the mob like a brave old Scottish knight, brought us word that he could assure us that our own Queen was safe in her own apartments, and that there had been no attack on the palace.|$|R

5000|$|Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{has been}} one of Morris' friends for over thirty years (Morris {{at one point in the}} 80s filled in for Kiedis, who was off scoring drugs and missed his band's show), and is a huge fan and {{supporter}} of Off!. At every date on the Chili Peppers I'm with You World Tour, Kiedis has worn an Off! hat to promote the band. He has also sported the hat in some of the band's music videos. Off!, despite some backlash from punk fans, opened a few shows for the Chili Peppers during the tour. Morris said “I’ve known Anthony since the beginning of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony and Flea are my friends and if I want to go out and play shows with some of my friends, I’m going to. I’ve been playing music for over 33 years, and I have some friends that are in extremely large bands. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> night after night and play to people who know who we are, and that’s all fan-fucking-tastic, but part of our job is to take it up a couple of notches.

5000|$|Ruth Morton {{described}} life in Vancouver {{with her}} husband: “Mr. Morton and I came over from New Westminster one summer’s day in 1884 for an outing, just my late husband and myself. We {{had to buy}} our tickets for the stage the previous day, and afterwards we drove over the old Hastings Road, then a corduroy road through the trees. Mr. Morton was anxious that I should see the white sand at English Bay, {{and we tried to}} hire a boat by which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of the First Narrows, but no seaworthy boat could be procured—they were all leaky—so we did not go. He was very fascinated with the beauty of Vancouver as it was then. Whilst Mr. Edmund Ogle, my nephew, and I were waiting on the beach for Mr. Morton at Gastown, in front of us was a sow digging up the clams, and a crow hopping in front of her getting a meal from the bits of the clams. Edmund Ogle started a dry goods business in Vancouver, on Carrall and Powell streets I think, a week before the fire; all was destroyed; he lives in Toronto now. We saw the English church James and at George Black’s Hastings had lunch, and then went back to New Westminster on the stage, and from there up to Mission to the farm. At the time of the fire we were living at Mission. That Sunday afternoon a cloud of black smoke hovered high in the air across the river; it was evident a big fire was burning somewhere." ...|$|E
5000|$|Duff has {{described}} {{the change in the}} album's musical direction in an interview with MTV in 2015, citing [...] "The album is a range of stuff. I would say definitely in the beginning when I started writing, it was pretty heavy, coming out of my past year of - life. It's changed since then, which is good because I think that the overall theme too - me, personally, I'm not this super heavy girl. You know? I'm one for the sunshine, so it's shifted a lot and it feels a lot better to me." [...] From the interview, it was also mentioned that a track titled [...] "This Heart' which was about her son, {{was going to be on}} the album and was also speculated as the title. The track however never made the final cut. Duff has said regarding the album's lyrical content, [...] "I definitely want people to feel like they're getting a glimpse into my life and what I'm made of. I am a normal girl who has had a not-so-normal life. I feel like my fans have stuck with me because they can relate to me and I want them to. I want them to feel like <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and have a fun night together. I want them to know that my heart has been broken, but it's not the end of the world. Life goes on. I want them to feel like I'm there for them. I want them to feel happy. And I want them to know that I care and that I have cared about them all this time." ...|$|E
30|$|Data Sovereignty: PAR# 15 stated, “The hacker that we’ve {{put into}} place {{introduced}} some unreliability in our systems. I’m a little concerned about data sovereignty.” This category broadly refers to where the data is stored, and in what geographical location is the data hosted. One of the participants perceived the importance of proximity. PAR# 3 stated, “We need someone local. We wanted someone close that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to and physically touch…if something went wrong…that {{was part of the}} factor going into the cloud.” The relevance of the location determines the authority of a respective data centre to govern the customer data. For instance, the data of an Australian-based customer may be hosted at a US-based cloud service provider. The data, comprising of client records and other detailed information, may be looked at by US-based government officials under the USA Patriot Act. While there is confidentiality of these records, the officials can do this procedure which is within their jurisdiction. By contrast, if the data is hosted within the geographical location of the customer, the data of the cloud subscriber is protected. In terms of the perceived importance of data sovereignty, the respective authority of a cloud provider over their data is essential. PAR# 19 stated that, “Other things that are important to us and guiding our ability include data sovereignty, and the ability {{to get out of a}} cloud provider as well as get in. Obviously in the online music business, we have a fairly large music repository. If you are above the common application of several gigabytes or even hundred gigabytes…several hundred terabytes and upwards, then you got to have a clear picture of how you get in or out that sort of data footprint.” Another participant claimed that, “Some customers whose data is hosted in the US…the Patriot Act doesn’t bother them. It is important where it is hosted…how they manage their data centre…You have to do your own due diligence. Make sure to cover your bases.” PAR# 2. This participant underscored that reasonable processes should be employed in order for the customer to still have the authority over their data, and not be at the mercy of the cloud provider.|$|E
