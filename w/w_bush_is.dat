5|$|MacFarlane {{notes that}} he was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed to}} do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber on the sofa where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting it into her imaginary vagina (to see if it would turn into a pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E

25|$|Some of Horowitz's {{accounts}} of U.S. {{colleges and universities}} as bastions of liberal indoctrination have been disputed. For example, Horowitz alleged that a University of Northern Colorado student received a failing grade on a final exam for refusing to write an essay arguing that George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> a war criminal. A spokeswoman for the university said that the test question was not as described by Horowitz {{and that there were}} nonpolitical reasons for the grade, which was not an F.|$|E
25|$|George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of capital punishment. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were executed in that state, maintaining its record as the leading state in executions. As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Although Bush's support of the death penalty is known, controversy broke in 1999 when journalist Tucker Carlson revealed that the Governor had mocked the plight of Karla Faye Tucker in an interview.|$|E

500|$|The episode makes {{references}} to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is {{a reference to}} Mark Russell and/or Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that {{there are quite a}} few women senators, but Lisa asserts that there are only two. At the time of airing there were indeed only two female senators: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Then-President George H. <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: [...] "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light.|$|E
500|$|Preceding {{the album}} release, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} to promote the twentieth James Bond film of the same name. The song peaked at number eight in the United States, and number three in the United Kingdom. The production costs for the music video were over six million dollars, making it the second most expensive music video ever made, after [...] "Scream" [...] by Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. [...] "American Life" [...] was released as the lead single from the album on April 8, 2003 in the United States and on April 14, 2003 in Europe. Blender magazine listed the song as the ninth worst song ever. There are two music videos. The first version {{is based on a}} fashion runway, with extra's including Children dressed in provocative war inspired outfits. The scene descends into violence and fighting to which the audience find amusement. At the end of the music video, then-President of the United States, George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> portrayed by a lookalike lighting a cigar. The anti-war content of its music video was interpreted as being unpatriotic, making Madonna withdraw its release from American music channels. She also released a statement saying she did so because she believed it was not appropriate to air it at that time, and that {{she did not want to}} risk offending anyone who could misinterpret its meaning. A second video was produced, showing Madonna donning military clothing and singing in front of the various flags of the world. The song debuted at number ninety on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at number thirty-seven on the chart, becoming Madonna's 45th Top 40 hit in the chart. The song also peaked at number two in the UK, seven in Austria and Australia, and ten in France and Germany.|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, 2003, {{during a}} London concert, nine {{days before the}} March 19, 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines told the audience: [...] "We don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States (George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush)</b> <b>is</b> from Texas". The positive reaction to this statement from the British audience contrasted with the negative reaction, including boycotts, that ensued in the United States, where the band was denounced by talk shows and their albums were discarded in public protest.|$|E
