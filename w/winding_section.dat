500|$|A {{combined}} {{offer from}} the city council of Le Mans and local hoteliers to contribute funding to the Grand Prix persuaded the ACF to hold the race {{on the outskirts of}} the city, where the Automobile Club de la Sarthe devised a [...] circuit. Running through farmlands and forests, the track, like most circuits of the time, formed a triangle. It started outside the village of Montfort, and headed south-west towards Le Mans. Competitors then took the Fourche hairpin, which turned sharply left and slowed the cars to around , and then an essentially straight road through Bouloire south-east towards Saint-Calais. The town was bypassed with a temporary wooden plank road, as the track headed north on the next leg of the triangle. Another plank road through a forest to a minor road allowed the track to bypass most of the town of Vibraye, before it again headed north to the outskirts of La Ferté-Bernard. A series of left-hand turns took competitors back south-west towards Montfort on the last leg of the triangle, a straight broken by a more technical <b>winding</b> <b>section,</b> near the town of Connerré. Competitors lapped the circuit twelve times over two days, six times on each day, a total distance of [...]|$|E

50|$|A {{particularly}} <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> of the Karwendel Railway {{with many}} tunnels runs over the Seefeld Saddle roughly {{parallel to the}} Seefelder Straße. The line runs from Innsbruck via Seefeld and Mittenwald to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and has several stations or halts including Reith, Seefeld and Scharnitz.|$|E
50|$|The road {{is sealed}} but {{relatively}} narrow {{and has a}} steep 14 km <b>winding</b> <b>section.</b> In recent years storms and associated flash flooding have washed away sections of the roadway where it rises to the ranges, leading to traffic being limited to one lane at the waterfalls on the Dorrigo Range.|$|E
50|$|A section from Teranum to Bentong was {{constructed}} in 1915. The original FT8 section from Raub to Bentong via Teranum was bypassed by a more straight super two highway in 1958 in conjunction of the opening of FELDA Lurah Bilut, causing the old, <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> to be re-gazetted as the Federal Route 218.|$|E
50|$|Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) in {{his early}} ballets L'Oiseau de feu (1910); Petrushka (1911); Le Sacre du printemps (1913) {{utilized}} extra-large <b>wind</b> <b>sections.</b> After the first World War, Stravinsky abandoned such huge orchestral writing and focused on smaller groups for a time, including wind groups. His work Symphonies of Wind Instruments (1920) for orchestral-sized <b>wind</b> <b>section</b> {{is considered one of}} the most important 20th century compositions written for wind instruments, and his two later works for jazz band Preludium for Jazz Band (1936/37) and Ebony Concerto for clarinet and jazz band (1945 - written for band leader Woody Herman) also have importance.|$|R
5000|$|The aristocrats who {{employed}} a Harmonie would often also maintain a small orchestra, numerically dominated by, or consisting entirely of, the string section. When {{members of the}} Harmonie participated in performances with such orchestras, it became possible for the composer to enrich the musical texture with wind parts, without increasing the payroll cost of his patron. Thus, [...] "Harmonie" [...] came also to designate the <b>wind</b> <b>section</b> of a small orchestra. Of this practice, Fitzpatrick writes, [...] "It was II's Harmonie who made up the <b>wind</b> <b>section</b> in Beethoven's orchestra of 1800 the premiere of the composer's First Symphony." ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>section,</b> is {{dominated}} by an instrument akin to the clarinet. This is not normally used for the dances. This {{is important to note}} because the Sinhalese dance is not set to music as the western world knows it; rhythm is king.|$|R
5000|$|From here, {{the road}} follows its own {{course for the}} next 25 miles. It ascends a high plateau on a narrow and <b>winding</b> <b>section,</b> before {{descending}} into {{the valley of the}} River Tweed at Stobo. It will almost parallel the course of the River Tweed for the remainder of its journey south to Galashiels.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, {{the highway}} was {{deviated}} to bypass Springwood shopping centre, eliminating two narrow underpasses of the railway {{from the highway}} route. The previous route remain in use for local traffic as Macquarie Road. In 1968 a dual carriageway 3 km deviation was opened at Prospect. This replaced the only <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> of the Highway between Parramatta and Penrith.|$|E
5000|$|The B5470 is a road in England, {{running from}} Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire to Macclesfield, Cheshire via Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire. The hilly and <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> between Whaley Bridge and Macclesfield {{is often called}} ‘The Highwayman’ after a {{prominent}} roadside pub, now closed. Much of the route follows former turnpike roads through a scenic area of the Peak District National Park.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the Hereford High School Symphonic Band {{performed}} Chorus Angelorum by composer Samuel R. Hazo. The {{piece was}} commissioned for the Symphonic <b>Winds</b> <b>section</b> two years prior, {{after the death}} of Joey and Audrey Baseman (whose siblings and grandchildren were in the band).|$|R
50|$|There is a marching band.

50|$|Beginning in 2014, Somerset County began {{reconstruction}} of a steep, <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> of CR 518 in Franklin Township {{to reduce the}} potential for accidents and {{improve the quality of}} the road in the area. The $4.6-million project involves blasting into a hillside to allow for a realigned section of roadway and the addition of storm sewers and shoulders. Final completion of the project occurred in August 2015.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{well known}} to {{mountain}} bikers {{as the site of}} the Sparrow Hill mountain biking area, an eastern enclave of Kowen Forest. A new 5km alignment of the Kings Highway was constructed in 2010-11 to improve the safety of the road. The new section divides Sparrow Hill into two parts, and includes overtaking lanes in both directions, and bypasses a dangerous, <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> of road, including at least six bends.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{choice of}} Delibes was his pronounced use of brass and wind instruments, {{especially in the}} characteristically powerful prelude. Delibes {{was also one of}} the first composers to write for the alto saxophone, an instrument used extensively in the heavier <b>wind</b> <b>sections</b> such as the barcarolle in Act III.|$|R
50|$|Radiohead has {{performed}} with a <b>wind</b> <b>section</b> in their 2000 performances in New York City (one {{of which was}} at Radiohead's taping for Saturday Night Live), a 2001 performance in London for the BBC's Later with Jools Holland, during a 2001 concert in Paris, and on The Colbert Report in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Haydn's Mass in B flat major, (H. 22/14, 1802) is {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Harmoniemesse", because (unlike the other masses Haydn wrote during this time) it {{includes}} parts {{for a whole}} <b>wind</b> <b>section,</b> thanks to the recent reinstatement of these instruments in the musical establishment of Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II.|$|R

It is a 17 km drive up the road and {{be aware of the}} narrow <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> climbing up the Lussier gorge {{towards the end of the}} drive.|$|E
50|$|North-northeast of the Zirler Berg a {{particularly}} <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> of the Karwendel Railway with many tunnels runs over the Seefeld Saddle roughly {{parallel to the}} Seefelder Straße. The line runs from Innsbruck via Seefeld and Mittenwald to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and has several stations or halts including Reith, Seefeld and Scharnitz. East of the mountain the railway enters a wide curve over bridges and through tunnels on the south flank of the Rauenkopf and southwestern side of the Brunstkopf, crossing the Schlossbach.|$|E
50|$|New York State Route 97 (NY 97) is a 70.53 mi north-south scenic {{route in}} {{southern}} New York in the United States. It runs from U.S. Route 6 (US 6) and US 209 in Port Jervis to NY 17 in Hancock. Its most famous {{feature is the}} Hawk's Nest, a tightly <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> of the road along the Delaware River, located {{a few miles north}} of Port Jervis. NY 97 intersects NY 52 in Narrowsburg and indirectly connects to three Pennsylvania state highways due to its proximity to the state line.|$|E

50|$|The {{instrumental}} solo pieces can be monophonic or polyphonic. There are monophonic instruments {{like those}} of the brass and <b>wind</b> <b>sections,</b> that can only produce single notes at one time, and polyphonic instruments, like the guitar and piano, that have the option of also playing with polyphony, which is when notes are played simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of ’69 (summer of Woodstock), Wilmer hired a young <b>wind</b> <b>section</b> to match the current sounds of BST, James Brown, Wilson Pickett etc. Frank Grasso-Trumpet, Steve Weinstein-Trombone, and Peter Kanyuk- Woodwinds. (Peter Kanyuk at fb has {{painstakingly}} restored 30 live audio cuts of Wilmer and the Dukes, none of which appear on his 1969 LP album.|$|R
50|$|The {{road leading}} up towards {{the summit of}} Clyde Mountain is a 5 km section of steep, <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> of the Kings Highway in New South Wales, Australia. It is the {{location}} of many crashes, 22% of all incidents on the Kings Highway occurring on a 40 km stretch on and near the mountain. There are three safety ramps (runaway truck ramps) for trucks or heavy vehicles which lose control of their speed or suffer brake failure. Slow vehicle turnouts have been added on the Clyde Mountain descent, which allows vehicles to pass trucks in low gear.|$|E
50|$|Between Karlsruhe and Rastatt {{two lines}} run {{relatively}} near each other, effectively providing four tracks. The double-track section between Rastatt station and Rastatt-Niederbühl {{is to be}} increased to four lines {{with the construction of}} the Rastatt Tunnel. Between Rastatt-Niederbühl and Offenburg, two new high-speed tracks have been completed next to the old double-track line. A new section of line from Schliengen to Haltingen between Freiburg and Basel, including the 9385 metre-long Katzenberg Tunnel, was opened on 9 December 2012 to avoid a narrow, <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> between the Rhine and the Isteiner Klotz hills. The remaining sections between Offenburg, Freiburg and the Katzenberg Tunnel are still being planned.|$|E
50|$|A {{portion of}} the Federal Route 8 {{was a part of}} the 80-mile Kuala Kubu-Kuala Lipis Road, the {{earliest}} trunk road in Pahang, which was constructed by the Public Works Department in 1887. The Kuala Kubu-Kuala Lipis Road connected Kuala Kubu Bharu in Selangor and Kuala Lipis in Pahang. Later, a section from Teranum to Bentong was constructed in 1915. At the same time, the Kota Bharu-Kuala Krai Road was constructed, together with the Kuala Terengganu-Kuantan Road FT3. The original FT8 section from Raub to Bentong via Teranum was later bypassed by a more straight super two highway in 1958 in conjunction of the opening of FELDA Lurah Bilut, causing the old, <b>winding</b> <b>section</b> to be re-gazetted as the Federal Route 218.|$|E
50|$|The {{track was}} written about Jenny Boyd, sister of Pattie Boyd, {{while they were}} all with The Beatles in Rishikesh. She married Mick Fleetwood and was, at one time, the {{sister-in-law}} of George Harrison and, later, Eric Clapton. The song features a <b>wind</b> <b>section</b> with oboe, flute, and bassoon. The last stanza of the song is sung in French.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 Beecham was {{assembling}} a new orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO). Jackson was its principal flute from its inception. He was soon {{joined in the}} woodwind section by Jack Brymer (clarinet), Gwydion Brooke (bassoon) and Terence MacDonagh (oboe). The Independent described them as [...] "arguably the finest ever <b>wind</b> <b>section</b> ... they became known as 'The Royal Family'." ...|$|R
50|$|In November 2009, Magenta {{performed}} an acoustic concert at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios near Bath. The concert was notable for featuring a <b>wind</b> <b>section,</b> and the one-off return of Martin Rosser on rhythm guitar - Colin Edwards having recently departed the band. The concert Live At Real World was released as a double CD and DVD in September 2010.|$|R
