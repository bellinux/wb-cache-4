5|$|Paul and Amanda Kirby, a {{seemingly}} wealthy couple, offer Grant funding for his research if he <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Although initially suspicious of their true intentions, Grant is desperate for research support and thus reluctantly agrees. He flies there along with Paul, Amanda, Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky, Cooper, and their pilot Nash. On the plane, Grant learns that the Kirbys actually plan {{to land on}} the island. When Grant opposes, he is knocked out by Cooper and wakes to the sound of Amanda using a megaphone. This attracts a Spinosaurus, which devours Cooper and Nash. The creature's obstructing of the runway causes the plane to crash into the forest. Fleeing, the survivors briefly lose the Spinosaurus, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus. The Spinosaurus returns, but the group escapes while the two predators fight each other. The Spinosaurus bites the T. rexs neck and kills it.|$|E

25|$|New {{technology}} in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition. By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income {{as well as}} open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims {{to be part of}} the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.|$|E
25|$|Secure {{land tenure}} is {{important}} for slum dwellers as an authentic recognition of their residential status in urban areas. It also encourages them to upgrade their housing facilities, which <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> protection against natural and unnatural hazards. Undocumented ownership with no legal title to the land also prevents slum settlers from applying for mortgage, which might worsen their financial situations. In addition, without registration of the land ownership, the government has difficulty in upgrading basic facilities and improving the living environment. Insecure tenure of the slum, as well as lack of socially and politically acceptable alternatives to slums, also creates difficulty in citywide infrastructure development such as rapid mass transit, electrical line and sewer pipe layout, highways and roads.|$|E

It’s about the lies we tell them about fame and money and what’s {{beautiful}} and what <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> life. It’s an apology for those lies. But more than that, it’s {{an invitation to the}} truth about a God who is bigger than the pain this world so often leaves them in." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the same}} 8-1 majority, the Court found a {{separate}} and independent {{ground for the}} reversal of Burton's convictions. Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: [...] " [...] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while I think they have, in the main, been covered by the charge, yet I <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> to you[...] [...] [...] These are abstract propositions of law, which I give {{in connection with the}} charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it. I am willing to give them, inasmuch as they are asked, and they contain general propositions of law." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} {{designed}} to promote the mascots. Turner Broadcasting System, the owner of Cartoon Network, invested US$750,000 in the series. Cartoon Network helped to coproduce the series, having won an open competition held by the Rio 2016 organizers to select a collaborator for the series. Brand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots [...] "are {{one of the principal}} methods of engaging the public with the Games. The cartoon <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> life, reinforcing the emotional link of the public with the event." [...] Although the series is targeted towards children, Sylmara Multini, Director of Licensing and Retail for the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee, stated that it will attract adults too.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The 1960 United States Census {{recorded}} just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, {{making it the}} least-populated state in the United States at that time. Interior Alaska contained about 28,000 residents, and promoters suggested that the dam's benefits would vastly outweigh the costs to the few residents who would be displaced. An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing [...] "not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world {{and it would be}} difficult to find an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding." [...] In a 1963 letter responding to a Sports Illustrated article about the dam, Gruening wrote, As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than they are now. Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief. Construction of the Rampart Dam <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> ample gainful employment, and in their new locations, chosen by them on the lake's borders, they will have better homes, better community facilities and a permanent income from now nonexistent activities, generated by the lake.|$|E

500|$|In 1849, the Royal Society of Arts {{decided to}} organise a {{retrospective}} exhibition of Etty's work, {{the first since}} the minor York exhibition of 1836. Etty agreed only on condition that all nine of his large works were included. The three Joan of Arc paintings were in London and easily accessible, and the Royal Scottish Academy was happy to lend The Combat, Benaiah and the Judith triptych, but the Royal Manchester Institution was deeply reluctant to lend The Sirens and Ulysses in light of concerns that transporting it would damage the fragile paintwork further. They were eventually persuaded to lend the piece after Etty {{and some of his}} friends visited Manchester to personally request they release it. The exhibition duly went ahead from 9June to 25August 1849, bringing together 133 Etty paintings for the first time; Etty hoped that it would raise public awareness of his abilities, writing to his friend Rev. Isaac Spencer [...] "Please God, I <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a taste of my quality". The exhibition was well received and well attended; even Etty's old adversaries at the Morning Chronicle recommending that readers [...] "lose no time in visiting this collection". However, it was a financial disaster for the Royal Society of Arts, faced with the cost of transporting large numbers of delicate artworks from around the country.|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

In other cases the Samiti <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> help as far as possible. In the case of those women whose full responsibility the Samiti will take they will educate them and through them spread women’s education. After they have finished their education they will take up the work of zenana (female) education. The Samiti <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> remuneration for their work. In this way two objectives will be accomplished. Hindu widows {{will be able to}} earn through service to others according to sanction of Hindu religion.” ...|$|E
