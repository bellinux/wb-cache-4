5000|$|A [...] "wet" [...] {{standpipe}} {{is filled}} with water and is pressurized at all times. In contrast to dry standpipes, {{which can be used}} only by firefighters, <b>wet</b> <b>standpipes</b> can be used by building occupants. <b>Wet</b> <b>standpipes</b> generally already come with hoses so that building occupants may fight fires quickly. This type of standpipe may also be installed horizontally on bridges.|$|R
50|$|Separated and {{protected}} bicycle lanes are a visually prominent feature {{on the south}} side of the new eastern section. The bikeway will carry recreational and commuter cyclists between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island.. Until that time cyclists and pedestrians must turn around and return to Oakland. The original eastern cantilever span had firefighting dry standpipes installed. No firefighting dry or <b>wet</b> <b>standpipes</b> were designed for the eastern section replacement, although, the firefighting <b>wet</b> <b>standpipes</b> do exist on the original western section visible on both the north-side upper and lower decks.|$|R
