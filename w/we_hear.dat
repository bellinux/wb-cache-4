5|$|Michael (turned {{back into}} a zombie) and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl {{into the corner of}} a nearby {{abandoned}} house. Michael then reaches for his date's throat as she lets out a bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and realize it was all a dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns around and looks at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{complexities}} relating to the transmission of sounds, {{at the point of}} reception (i.e. the ears), sound is readily dividable into two simple elements: pressure and time. These fundamental elements form the basis of all sound waves. They can be used to describe, in absolute terms, every sound <b>we</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E
25|$|From Pausanias <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> that Selene was {{supposed}} to have had by Endymion fifty daughters, who possibly represented the fifty lunar months of the Olympiad. Nonnus has Selene and Endymion as the parents of the beautiful Narcissus, but in other accounts, including Ovid's Metamorphoses, Narcissus was the son of Cephissus and Liriope.|$|E
25|$|Cnut was {{generally}} {{remembered as a}} wise and successful king of England, although this view may in part be attributable to his good treatment of the Church, keeper of the historic record. Accordingly, <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> of him, even today, as a religious man (see below), {{despite the fact that}} he was in an arguably sinful relationship, with two wives, and the harsh treatment he dealt his fellow Christian opponents.|$|E

25|$|Literature on spatial crossmodal biases {{suggests}} that visual modality often influences information from other senses. Some {{research indicates that}} vision dominates what <b>we</b> <b>hear,</b> when varying the degree of spatial congruency. This {{is known as the}} ventriloquist effect. In cases of visual and haptic integration, children younger than 8 years of age show visual dominance when required to identify object orientation. However, haptic dominance occurs when the factor to identify is object size.|$|E
25|$|While {{they receive}} less mention, {{numerous}} other gods and goddesses {{appear in the}} source material. (For a list of these deities, see List of Germanic deities.) Some of the gods <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> less about include the apple-bearing goddess Iðunn and her husband, the skaldic god Bragi; the gold-toothed, white-skinned god Heimdallr, born of nine mothers; the ancient god Týr, who lost a hand while binding the great wolf Fenrir; and the goddess Gefjon, who formed modern day Zealand, Denmark.|$|E

25|$|Frank, feeling deep {{guilt and}} now a hollow shell of his former self, moves {{to the city and}} starts selling computers. He spends all of his extra time with his children. A new couple, the Braces, buy the house and <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> Milly telling the story of the Wheelers to them. Shep stops the story and walks out of the house, crying. When Milly asks Shep what's wrong, he asks her in return to never talk about the Wheelers ever again.|$|E
25|$|The BBC {{reported}} that {{relations with the}} United States took {{a turn for the}} worse in 1998, when US Vice-President Al Gore stated at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference hosted by Malaysia:Democracy confers a stamp of legitimacy that reforms must have in order to be effective.

25|$|When <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> a car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car {{we see is}} the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>hear</b> {{but little}} of it under the Roman dominion; but {{it appears to have}} {{suffered}} severely in the First Servile War (134–132BC), and in consequence received a body of fresh colonists, who were established there by the praetor Publius Rupilius; {{and at the same time}} the relations of the old and new citizens were regulated by a municipal law, which still subsisted in the time of Cicero. In the days of the great orator, Heraclea appears to have been still a flourishing place; but it must soon after have fallen into decay, in common with most of the towns on the southern coast of Sicily.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains {{is given}} its first modern {{historical}} perspective by Edward Gibbon, who {{called it the}} last victory achieved {{in the name of}} the Western Roman Empire. Gibbon noted that it was from his enemies <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> of his terrible deeds, not from friendly chroniclers, emphasizing that the former had no reason to elevate Attila's reign of terror, but of proving Attila to be defeatable. The first individual historical survey of the battle was given by Sir Edward Creasy, who heralded it as a triumph of the Christian Europe over the pagan savages of Asia, saving classical heritage and European culture.|$|E
