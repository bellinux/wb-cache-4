In this article, the potential to reduce the life cycle (cradle to gate) <b>water</b> <b>footprints</b> of wheat and maize that contribute to 94 % of the local cereal production was assessed. Following ISO 14046, consumptive and degradative water use for the wheat-maize rotation system was modeled under different irrigation and nitrogen (N) application options. Reducing irrigation water volume by 33. 3 % compared to current practice did not cause a significant yield decline, but the <b>water</b> scarcity <b>footprint</b> and <b>water</b> eutrophication <b>footprint</b> were decreased by 27. 5 % and 23. 9 %, respectively. Similarly, reducing the N application rate by 33. 3 % from current practice did not cause a significant yield decline, but led to a 52. 3 % reduction in <b>water</b> eutrophication <b>footprint</b> while maintaining a similar <b>water</b> scarcity <b>footprint.</b> These results demonstrate that improving water and fertilizer management has great potential for reducing the crop <b>water</b> <b>footprints</b> at the farm scale.

The goal {{is to improve the}} railway construction processes with regard to their environmental impact, mainly in those aspects related to climate change such as carbon and <b>water</b> <b>footprints.</b> Based on a set of 27 indicators of every task in the construction process, a comprehensive compilation of basic information was performed, where the main project units and their sub-tasks were reviewed and analyzed. Afterwards, focus was on analyzing the transformation from environmental impact to carbon and <b>water</b> <b>footprints,</b> by means of the development of a consolidated evaluation methodology. A tool is being developed based on data mining and computational intelligence approaches.

40|$|The {{notions of}} virtual <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> <b>footprints</b> were {{introduced}} originally to {{bring attention to}} the large amounts of water required to produce crops and livestock. Recently, several authors have begun applying those notions in efforts to describe efficiency, equity, and the sustainability of resources and production activities. In this paper, I describe why the notions of virtual <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> <b>footprints</b> are not appropriate for analysing issues pertaining to those topics. Both notions lack a supporting conceptual framework and they contain too little information to enhance understanding of important policy issues. Neither notion accounts for the opportunity cost or scarcity value of water in any setting, or the impacts of water availability and use on livelihoods. In addition, countries trade in goods and services – not in crop and livestock water requirements. Thus, the notions of virtual <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> <b>footprints</b> cannot provide helpful insight regarding the sustainability of water use, economic efficiency, or social equity. Gaining such insight requires the application of legitimate conceptual frameworks, representing {{a broad range of}} perspectives from the physical and social sciences, with due consideration of dynamics, uncertainty, and the impacts of policy choices on livelihoods and natural resources...|$|R

The increasing proportion of lot-fed beef in Australia had a favourable impact on the carbon footprint of beef products, since the conversion of feed to meat products is more efficient in feedlot production systems than in grass-fed meat production, offsetting the effect of producing and transporting feedstuffs.

40|$|This study compares final fuel {{production}} costs of multiple biomass-to-liquid production facilities. Process economics are estimated for four different high moisture feedstocks, four different biomass supply chain pathways and three different conversion and upgrading technologies. Two biorefinery capacities are examined, small (200 tonne per day) and large (2000 tonne per day). Corn stover, corn silage giant miscanthus and sweet sorghum are the feedstocks considered for conversion via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and anaerobic digestion (AD). Final product finishing {{is done by}} hydroprocessing of the HTL biocrude and either Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis or methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) conversion of the AD biogas. <b>Water</b> <b>footprints</b> are estimated for blue, green and grey water consumption during the entire bio{{fuel production}} process for each scenario. In efforts to decrease the production costs, moisture and size reduction steps are omitted during the biomass supply chain stage. Multi-pass and single pass harvesting scenarios are considered along with wet and dry storage techniques. These steps lead to an estimated delivered feedstock cost ranging from $ 63. 84 -$ 86. 19 per tonne; comparable with recent literature. Conversion and upgrading pathways were chosen based on ability to handle high moisture feedstock. Capital investments were estimated for each technology scenario and ranged from $ 424 -$ 538 MM for the 2000 tpd biorefinery, within a degree of uncertainty; HTL resulted in the lowest estimated capital costs. Final fuel production costs ranged from $ 2. 04 -$ 6. 39 per gallon for all feedstocks and all conversion pathways, with stover and sorghum resulting in the lowest. The total <b>water</b> <b>footprints</b> were estimated to range from 5. 92 - 23. 21 Lw/Lb and 5. 58 - 14. 89 Lw/Lb for the conservative and optimal blue water scenarios, respectively.
