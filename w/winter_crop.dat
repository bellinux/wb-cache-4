500|$|Gina {{struck the}} island of Tikopia that had already {{sustained}} catastrophic damage from Cyclone Zoe {{less than two months}} previously. The storm brought high winds and torrential rains that triggered landslides. Dozens of homes were damaged and many areas newly re-planted after Cyclone Zoe were devastated again. The impacts of Gina reportedly set back recovery efforts by nearly six months. A total of 112 newly built houses and 128 newly built kitchens were severely damaged, and another 37 homes sustained minor damage. The newly planted <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> was lost due to sea spray, and 143 bags of rice, given as relief supplies after Cyclone Zoe, were lost. Following the storm, additional relief supplies and food were rushed to residents to ensure their safety. [...] These consisted of local foods, sago and mesh wiring, worth $14,400. A ship carrying five people became stranded in the Coral Sea during the storm when their engine failed on June 7. A mayday signal was put out by the captain but rough seas produced by the storm hampered rescue efforts. The five were safely rescued later that day, but two more people were discovered to be missing.|$|E
500|$|The Romans {{had used}} a two-field crop {{rotation}} agricultural system, but from the 8th century on, a three-field system became more common. [...] One field would be sown with a <b>winter</b> <b>crop,</b> the second with a spring crop, and the third left fallow. [...] This allowed a greater amount of spring crop of oats to be grown, which provided fodder for horses. Another advance during the Middle Ages was {{the development of the}} heavy mouldboard plough, which allowed dense and heavy soils to be tilled easily; this technology required the use of larger teams of draught animals including oxen and horses, as well as the adoption of larger fields. [...] Particularly after the 12th century, the increased use of both the horse collar and [...] use of iron horse shoes allowed horsepower to be directed more efficiently. Horse teams usually were four horses, or perhaps six, as compared to eight oxen, and the lesser numbers compensated {{for the fact that the}} horses needed to be fed grain on top of pasture, unlike oxen. The increased speed of horses also allowed more land to be ploughed in a day, with an eight ox plough team averaging half of an acre per day, but a horse team averaged a full acre per day.|$|E

The fields of <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> that were surrounded by similar fields or by <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> with meadow vegetation were researched. The Mus musculus became the dominant species in the <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> agrocoenosis. The R.

2500|$|Suhrawardy {{became the}} Deputy Mayor of the Calcutta Corporation {{at the age}} of 31 in 1924, and the Deputy Leader of the Swaraj Party in the Provincial Assembly. However, {{following}} the death of Chittaranjan Das in 1925, he began to disassociate himself with the Swaraj Party and eventually joined Muslim League. He served as Minister of Labour, and Minister of Civil Supplies under Khawaja Nazimuddin among other positions. He was the Minister responsible during the Midnapore (Bengal) famine of 1943, but did little to relieve it. Madhushree Mukherjee's 2010 book, [...] "Churchill's secret War" [...] places the responsibility mainly on Churchill, then wartime premier of Britain for actively blocking relief to Bengal, even when the Americans offered it in their ships, in the context of Churchill's [...] unceasing refrain of a [...] "scarcity of shipping" [...] in the Atlantic. (The alleged scarcity is seriously questioned by Mukherjee based on documents available recently). Suhrawardy's government [...] did implement British scorched earth policies designed [...] to counter Japanese invasion threats, policies like burning over a thousand fishing boats to block any potential movement of invading troops. These measures aggravated starvation and famine. Relief, it was said, [...] only arrived after Wavell became Viceroy, who used the Indian Army to organise relief. However, by that time, the <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> had arrived and famine conditions had already eased, after millions had earlier perished. In the Bengal Muslim League, Suhrawardy and Abul Hashim led a progressive line against the conservative stream led by Nazimuddin and Akram Khan.|$|E
2500|$|Warnings {{of famine}} began in March 1974 {{when the price}} of rice rose sharply. In this month [...] "widespread {{starvation}} started in Rangpur district", the region which would become one of three most afflicted. It had only been two years and three months {{since the end of the}} war for Bangladeshi independence (December 1971) and the country's formal creation. In many ways, Bangladesh's new state and devastated infrastructure and markets were wholly unprepared to deal with the situation. Corruption among the newly appointed officials was rampant and widespread. In April, though government officials reiterated that the crisis would be temporary, rice prices continued to rise sharply and reports of starvation became more widespread. From April to July, Bangladesh was hit by heavy rainfall and a series of devastating floods along the Brahmaputra river, with notably destructive incidents in May, July; the ability of the rice crops to survive this was reduced by the growing monoculture of HYV rice. In addition, neighbouring India declined to co-operate with the government of Bangladesh. Rice crops were devastated and prices rocketed. In October rice prices peaked and conditions eased by November 1974 as foreign aid and the <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> arrived. The famine was officially over by December, though [...] "excess" [...] mortality (e.g. by disease) continued well into the following year, as is the case with most famines. More people suffered in the rural areas due to starvation. Generally, regional famine intensity was correlated to flood exposure and no doubt the floods exacerbated the famine. However, though warnings of famine began long before the flood (as demonstrated above), it is to the floods which the famine is popularly blamed.|$|E

Around the temple were potato crops and peach-trees, rice, millet, yam, brinjal (egg-apple), fennel, hemp (for smoking its narcotic leaves), and cummin, etc. The potato thrives extremely well as a summer crop, at 7000 feet, in Sikkim, though I think the root (from the Dorjiling stock) cultivated as a <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> in the plains, is superior both in size and flavour. Peaches never ripen in this part of Sikkim, apparently from the want of sun; the tree grows well at from 3000 to 7000 feet elevation, and flowers abundantly; the fruit making the nearest approach to maturity (according to the elevation) from July to October. At Dorjiling it follows the English seasons, flowering in March and fruiting in September, when the scarce reddened and still hard fruit falls from the tree. In the plains of India, both this and the plum ripen in May, but the fruits are very acid.|$|E

40|$|In this work, we {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} agronomic factors in the selection for herbicide resistance in Apera spica-venti L. Beauv. (silky windgrass). During {{a period of three}} years, populations were collected in more than 250 conventional fields across Europe and tested for resistance in the greenhouse. After recording the field history of locations, a geo-referenced database has been developed to map the distribution of herbicide-resistant A. spica-venti populations in Europe. A Logistic Regression Model was used to assess whether and to what extent agricultural and biological factors (crop rotation, soil tillage, sowing date, soil texture and weed density) affect the probability of resistance selection apart from the selection pressure due to herbicide application. Our results revealed that rotation management and soil tillage are the factors that have the greatest influence on the model. In addition, first order interactions between these two variables were highly significant. Under conventional tillage, a percentage of <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> in the rotation exceeding 75 % resulted in a 1280 -times higher risk of resistance selection compared to rotations with less than 50 % of <b>winter</b> <b>crops.</b> Under conservation tillage, the adoption of &gt; 75 % of <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> increased the risk of resistance 13 -times compared to rotations with less than 50 % of <b>winter</b> <b>crops.</b> Finally, early sowing and high weed density significantly increased the risk of resistance compared to the reference categories (later sowing and low weed density, respectively). Soil texture had no significant influence.
