He sat in Parliament, {{either in the}} Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.|$|E

However, political analysts argued that Russia’s fragmented leadership and lack of market regulation—along {{with the fact that}} several powerful Russian officials would benefit from a default—reduced Russia’s <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay.

Concerning Final Fantasy XI, {{at the time}} of the original English-only European release in 2004, producer Hiromichi Tanaka had stated that while Japanese/North American/Australian simultaneous releases are possible due to translating only Japanese to English, it was not possible for European countries due to the difficulty of finding good Japanese-to-European-languages translators, and the fact that second-hand translations from the English would be akin to [...] "Chinese whispers". However, the team later integrated full-fledged French and German localization teams, achieving simultaneous release from the Japanese for three different languages from 2007 on. Another example of synchronized localization is Final Fantasy XIII: the company started the localization process in several languages alongside the game's development to lessen the delay between the local and international releases. For self-contained series or games linked by story events or similar elements, Square Enix makes an effort to use the same localization teams, as in the case of Ivalice titles or Kingdom Hearts.|$|E

50|$|In The Fat Tail: The Power of Political Knowledge for Strategic Investing, {{political}} scientists Ian Bremmer and Preston Keat propose {{to apply the}} fat tail concept to geopolitics. As William Safire notes in his etymology of the term, a fat tail occurs {{when there is an}} unexpectedly thick end or “tail” toward the edges of a distribution curve, indicating an irregularly high likelihood of catastrophic events. This represents the risks of a particular event occurring that are so unlikely to happen and difficult to predict that many choose to ignore their possibility. One example that Bremmer and Keat highlight in The Fat Tail is the August 1998 Russian devaluation and debt default. Leading up to this event, economic analysts predicted that Russia would not default because the country had both the ability and <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>make</b> its payments.

500|$|The UFA {{took office}} {{at a time}} of drought in the {{southern}} regions of the province. At Brownlee's instigation, the government appointed a three-person panel, led by Charles Alexander Magrath, to investigate the problem. [...] In 1922 the government passed the Drought Relief Act. [...] The Act, a Brownlee brainchild, created a Drought Relief Commissioner to whom farmers in affected areas could turn for financial counselling and asset administration. [...] It authorized the adjustment of farmers' debts to levels that were within the debtors' means, but still sufficiently acceptable to creditors that their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> loans would not disappear altogether. [...] Brownlee hoped that this system would provide affected farmers with sound financial advice and facilitate the fair division of farmers' assets among competing creditors without forcing farmers to pay high legal fees. [...] In 1923 this was replaced by the Debt Adjustment Act, which strengthened the commissioner's powers and was intended to extend his jurisdiction over the entire province; due to opposition from lenders, the portions of the act dealing with other than drought-stricken areas were never proclaimed.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, as {{the game}} has surpassed 450,000 units sold, McMillen stated that he was {{approached}} by a publisher that had interest in bringing the title to the Nintendo 3DS as a downloadable title through the Nintendo eShop, though McMillen had reservations given Nintendo's reputation for less risque content. In late February, McMillen stated that Nintendo had rejected the game because of [...] "questionable religious content". He believed this stemmed from Germany's classification board rating the existing Windows version of the game as [...] "age 16+" [...] due to potentially blasphemous content, the first such time a game was rated in that manner in the country. McMillen noted that Nintendo executives he spoke to before this decision had noted some blasphemous content would have been acceptable, and were more concerned with overtly religious content. He also noted that he was approached about his <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some changes to the game {{to make it more}} suitable for the 3DS, but never was given a list of specific changes. McMillen speculated that Nintendo was worried about its reputation; because of the game's resemblance to The Legend of Zelda, an unknowing child could potentially have downloaded the title and been shocked by the content, which would have reflected poorly on Nintendo.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} seen the message of Mansfield Park as abolitionist. Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford as [...] "an act of rebellion, {{endangering}} a system based upon the exchange of women between men as surely as a slave's refusal to work". Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in Mansfield Park and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous with his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the [...] "moral blight" [...] at Mansfield Park remains after he returns to England. Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen {{was one of the}} writers who [...] "made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm", but argued slavery in Mansfield Park [...] "is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge", but rather used by Austen [...] "to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people". Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and [...] "by implication overseas". Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which again to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies. Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that much discussed scene about the [...] "dead silence" [...] that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to teh moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chosen {{to be involved in the}} abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel suggested that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park come from the plantation in Antigua. John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric as literal, and that Sir Thomas <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean suggested he be understood as a good master.
