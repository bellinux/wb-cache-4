5|$|During the Late Archaic period, {{the climate}} became wetter again and by {{approximately}} 3000 BCE {{the rise of}} water tables allowed an increase in population. Cultural development also took place. Florida Indians formed into three similar but distinct cultures: Okeechobee, Caloosahatchee, and Glades, named for the bodies of <b>water</b> <b>where</b> they were centered.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the <b>water</b> <b>where</b> they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|St Mawes Castle is {{situated}} on a headland over the Carrock Roads, overlooked by higher {{land to the}} rear. At {{the top of the}} site is the entrance to the castle, the high-level gun batteries and the 16th-century Henrician Castle; the terraced site slopes down to the <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> gun batteries and the 16th-century blockhouse look out across the water.|$|E

5|$|The hen alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch. The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has {{completed}} moulting.|$|E
5|$|They roost {{in shallow}} <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> {{they may be}} safe from some ground predators. Adult birds do not moult their {{feathers}} annually and instead feathers are replaced once {{every two or three}} years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in <b>water</b> <b>where</b> hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E

5|$|On 16 August, Clarisse {{departed}} Isle de France {{for another}} cruise; she sailed to La Réunion carrying despatches of Malartic to the governor. She then cruised to Java to procure <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> she arrived on 27 September. On 1 October, Surcouf captured a Danish merchantman, which he sent away under Lieutenant Fonroc; on 4 November, the Portuguese merchantman Nostra Signora de la Conception carrying 116 000 piastres; on 6, a British ship laden with a salt cargo; and on 11 November, the 20-gun Auspicious, with a cargo worth 1,032,580 francs.|$|E
5|$|Sponge flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the <b>water</b> <b>where</b> they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the sponge and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling {{to the surface of}} the sponge while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E
5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of <b>water</b> <b>where</b> it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E

50|$|The {{members of}} this tribe are small {{elongated}} fish found in schools in open <b>waters</b> <b>where</b> they feed on plankton. They are mouthbrooders.|$|R
5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims out into the open <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims {{the surface of the water}} with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} the secrecy of the weapon, its use was initially permitted only over <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> a dud round could {{not fall into}} enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission {{for it to be}} used over land. It proved particularly effective against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp in 1944. The use of a version fired from howitzers against ground targets was authorized in response to the German Ardennes Offensive in December 1944, with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
5|$|For a while, Red and {{her pack}} are happy, feeding off the {{plentiful}} carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack's {{way of life}} is upset by an invasion of large Acrocanthosaurus, huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added competition for food puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death of one of the chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red's sister. Red, torn between a prospective mate and her kin, tries to defuse the situation. Two Acrocanthosaurus watch the commotion and take the opportunity to attack the Utahraptor. Meanwhile, a Kronosaurus ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures the female Acrocanthosaurus into deep <b>water</b> <b>where</b> the larger predator is dragged under by the Kronosaurus. Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow <b>water,</b> <b>where</b> the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E
