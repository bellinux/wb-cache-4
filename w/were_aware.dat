5|$|The British {{preparations}} {{could not}} be made in secret, and by March 1915, the Turks <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> that a force of fifty thousand British and thirty thousand French troops was gathering at Lemnos.

5|$|The {{third phase}} {{received}} the least consideration, but naval planners <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> that Singapore {{was too far}} from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila {{being used as a}} forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> of the impact it could have on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off.

In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E

Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E

5|$|Held at a {{price of}} C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics cost more to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter.
