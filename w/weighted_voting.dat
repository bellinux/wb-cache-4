The idea of weighting countries' votes according to their financial contribution to the organization is not unprecedented, as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other Bretton Woods institutions use this method.|$|E
5|$|The drive {{towards a}} boycott {{was fueled by}} {{the large number of}} African nations which became {{independent}} in the late 1950s and early 1960s. To prevent the new nations from overwhelming the ISFs, Brundage proposed that the federations adopt <b>weighted</b> <b>voting</b> systems to allow earlier members to wield disproportionate influence, which some did. By 1962, with the suspension of South Africa from FIFA (the association football governing body), Brundage had come around to the position that South Africa's racist policies were inconsistent with the ideals of the Olympic movement. At the 1963 IOC session in Baden-Baden (moved there from Nairobi when Kenyan officials refused to issue visas to South African representatives), the IOC voted to suspend South Africa from the Olympics unless its NOC and government adopted non-discrimination policies regarding Olympic selection. This did not come to pass, and South Africa did not participate in 1964. In 1968, Brundage and the IOC invited a South African team (supposedly to be multiracial) to the Mexico City Games, but under a threatened boycott and with evidence of minimal South African compliance, withdrew it.|$|E

25|$|The Regional District {{is governed}} by a board of 11 directors. The Board {{consists}} of one representative from each municipality, usually the mayors, and one director from each electoral area. The municipal representatives, and their alternates, are elected by the municipal councils and the electoral area directors are elected for 3 year terms by their constituents during province-wide local elections. Due to its population size relative to the other jurisdictions and the Board's <b>weighted</b> <b>voting</b> scheme, Fort St. John elects two directors and two alternates. The Board annually elects a chairperson from its membership. The Board convenes twice {{a month in the}} board room of Regional District office in Dawson Creek, although they occasionally meet in other member municipalities. Portions of these meetings are dedicated to the matters arising from the Peace River Hospital District which has the same membership and is responsible for raising capital for hospital expenditures.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1960s, the New Jersey Senate had 21 representatives, {{one from}} each county {{regardless}} of population. In {{the wake of}} the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, David Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of two union leaders, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The senate enacted a proposal whereby each senator's vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, [...] under which Cape May County's senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. In a decision issued on December 15, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the <b>weighted</b> <b>voting</b> system as adopted was unconstitutional. The court ordered that interim measures be established for the 1965 legislative elections, in which <b>weighted</b> <b>voting</b> {{could be used as a}} temporary measure, and that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with [...] "one man, one vote" [...] requirements be in place before elections took place in 1967.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper won an IRV election to become party leader in the 2004 leadership election. In 2013, the Liberal Party of Canada membership elected Justin Trudeau as party leader through IRV in a national leadership election.

2500|$|The {{validity}} of the assessment ballot process under Proposition 218 was upheld by a California appellate court in 2002. [...] Property owner elections with <b>weighted</b> <b>voting</b> do not violate the federal constitutional requirement of “one man, one vote” under the limited circumstances of a special-purpose unit of government assigned the performance of functions affecting definable groups of constituents more than others. [...] Such {{is the case with}} assessment districts under Proposition 218. [...] Furthermore, since only special benefits are assessable under Proposition 218, voters residing within the boundaries of an assessment district who do not own property within the assessment district are also not deemed under the California Constitution to have been deprived of the right to vote for any assessment.|$|E

[...] A local initiative to reduce or repeal the assessment is an available remedy to address such an inequity. [...] Should an assessment reduction or repeal initiative qualify for the ballot, the election would be by the registered voters and the ballots would not be weighted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To date, label fusion {{methods have}} {{primarily}} relied either on global (e. g. STAPLE, globally <b>weighted</b> <b>vote)</b> or voxelwise (e. g. locally <b>weighted</b> <b>vote)</b> performance models. Optimality {{of the statistical}} fusion framework hinges upon {{the validity of the}} stochastic model of how a rater errs (i. e., the labeling process model). Hitherto, approaches have tended to focus on the extremes of potential models. Herein, we propose an extension to the STAPLE approach to seamlessly account for spatially varying performance by extending the performance level parameters to account for a smooth, voxelwise performance level field that is unique to each rater. This approach, Spatial STAPLE, provides significant improvements over state-of-the-art label fusion algorithms in both simulated and empirical data sets...|$|R
