40|$|The Master's {{thesis is}} focused on the Slovakian TV show Nákupné maniačky and its' audience. The purpose of the thesis is to reveal the motivations leading to <b>watching</b> <b>this</b> <b>show</b> and to explore, whether the viewers {{perceive}} the show as a fashion show which allows them to draw inspiration, or rather as a reality show that should entertain them. The theoretical part introduces the concepts as audience, uses and gratifications and reality show genre. The final analysis of the acquired data is based on these terms but it aims to invent a new hypothesis. The second part is devoted to the research that is based on a qualitative method of a grounded theory. Required data was collected by the semi-structured interviews with viewers divided into two age categories. The result of categorizing data indicates that for all viewers the main motivation for watching the show is to have fun. Participants reported enjoying the program because of its' humour, while fashion plays an irrelevant role. The findings also show that participants are aware of interventions of production and they explained manipulating competitors as a strategy of the broadcasters to entertain audience and attract more viewers. This assumption was confirmed by an informant interview with one of the creators of the show...|$|E

The realization of participants mostly exist is simplethings (conscious) because the people often told about themselves when they visited that show, the realization of process mostly exist in the data is polar: non-phasal verbs in present tense because most of people often applied non-phasal verbs in their writing and they also often described what “Songs of the Sea” is like so that tenses which was frequently used is present tense, meanwhile for the realization of circumstance mostly existed in the data is macro circumstances because in the data is found so many circumstances which have more than one word.
