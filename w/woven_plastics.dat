The test program consisted of (i) falling weight impact tests for {{the determination of the}} penetration energy and the influence of laminate construction on damage development and (ii) re-peated falling weight impact tests for the determination of the impact fatigue lifetime and damage development under repeated impact conditions at sub-penetration energy levels. The objective of this work is to compare the impact behaviour of cross-ply laminates based on a brittle unsaturated polyester resin and a more ductile vinyl ester resin system and two types of glass reinforcement, i. e. woven- and multiaxial non-crimp fabric. The penetration energy of the various composite laminates appeared to be mainly influenced by the type of reinforcement, whereas damage development during (repeated) impact is strongly influenced by both fibre architecture and resin. No significant effect of the different material parameters investigated on the number of impacts to penetration (impact fatigue lifetime) is observed.

It is less sensitive to the implemented NDT and it presents different values for different delamination extension patterns.

The look of my garments is about crisp clean lines, slim silhouettes, and a jolt of unexpected color and pattern. I wanted to create a garment that would portray myself as well as my interests. Inspiration for my garment came from pop culture, music, art, shoes, and current trends. I used earth tones and wooden buttons to display my love and appreciation for the outdoors and the natural world. Process: Throughout the design development phase, I researched streetwear trends as well as menâs sportswear trends. I wanted to design garments that could be worn comfortably and casual while still giving the appearance of a clean, together look. This led me to use crisp, clean lines, accompanied with a European silhouette. Techniques: To begin my garments, I first drew flat sketches of my conceptualization. I then took measurements of my model and began the tedious task of creating the patterns. At the drafting table, I began flat patterning the individual pattern pieces. After completion of all of my pattern pieces, I sewed together a sample. From here, I fitted the sample to my model, made alterations to my patterns, trued all of the lines, and began to create my final garment.

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of <b>woven</b> carbon-fiber reinforced <b>plastic</b> (CFRP) composites {{is influenced by}} the complex architecture of the reinforcement phase. Computational (i. e. finite element based) approaches have been used increasingly to model not only the global laminate stiffness, but also damage evolution and laminate strength. The modeling combines the identification of the architectural unit cell (UC), the selection of suitable constitutive models of the different phases, the creation of a fine discretization of the UC in finite elements, the application of an incremental solution procedure that solves iteratively for the stresses and strains in the UC, [1]. The experimental validation of computational models is carried out mainly at the macroscopical level, i. e. simulation of the macroscopic stress-strain curve. Damage, however, is a localized, straindependent phenomenon and therefore only accurate strain distribution within the UC (at the mesolevel) can identify critical conditions in terms of damage location, extension and evolution. The validation of computational damage procedures is a key task and full-field optical strain analysis methods appear the ideal instrument. However, only limited examples of direct finte element method (FEM) vs experimental strain correlation are found because of the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of some techniques and the complexity and applicative difficulty of others. The aim of the present paper is to present the application of the digital image correlation (DIC) technique, [2], to the full-field strain analysis at the mesoscopic level (i. e. within the UC) of a woven CFRP lamina when the direction of loading forms an angle to the material direction. The material under consideration is a woven carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite. Orthogonal yarns, each made of of several thousand fibers, are woven according the twill-weave architecture is shown in Fig. 1 a. Single-ply laminas were manufactured and tested to eliminate the random 3 D influence of multiple-ply laminates and to favor computational model validation. Specimens with different loading directions with respect to the material principal directions were prepared and tested in a servo-hydraulic testing machine. Specimen surface preparation consisted in a speckle pattern generation to allow the application of the DIC tecnique. During the tensile experiment, the speckle pattern is recorded (frame rate of 0. 1 picture/second) using a CCD camera equipped with a microscopic lens and adjustable light sources. In-house DIC software was used for in-plane displacement and strain determination and mapping. For brevity only the case of loading in the tow yarn direction is considered here. Fig. 1 b shows a tipical strain map obtained with the DIC technique at an applied macroscopic strain of 0. 9 %. The strains are small but the DIC dechnique is sensitive enough and suitable filtering reduce the noise level of the strain maps. Strong local strain gradients are determined and referred to the yarn architecture in Fig. 1 c. The DIC measurements were validated by averaging the strain over the field of view and comparing it with the macroscopic strain given by a high-sensitivity MTS extensometer. The mesoscopic srain data obtained with DIC are used to assess and validate parallel material model development by direct FEM vs experimental strain correlation. Fig. 2 a shows the FEM model of the unit cell for the twill-weave architecture with a detail of the yarn geometry and finite element discretization. Suitable boundary conditions are applied to the UC model contours before the analysis, [1].

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P CEE 2016 LinJXL, 408 pages :color illustrationsCompared with {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines (HAWT), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have the primary advantages of insensitivity to wind direction and turbulent wind, a simpler structure, less fatigue loading, and easy maintenance. As a result, {{a renewed interest}} in VAWTs has been seen in recent years and there is a trend worldwide in building large-scale VAWTs. Nevertheless, VAWTs were not pursued after brief development and failing in the 1980 s, which resulted in a lack of design experience of large-scale VAWTs. Furthermore, VAWTs suffer the disadvantages of low power coefficient and difficulties in self-start and shut-down. Hence, great research efforts are urgently required to make VAWTs workable. In this regard, this thesis is devoted to a systematic and novel study of large-scale VAWTs, which includes the determination of wind loads on all the components of the VAWT using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, the finite element modelling and model updating of laminated composite blades, the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of blades and other components of the VAWT, the pitch control systems for four states of the VAWT, the structural health monitoring (SHM) of the VAWT, and the concept of the smart VAWT. To conduct fatigue and ultimate strength analyses, dynamic loads on the whole VAWT must be determined. A practical method of wind load simulation for VAWTs is proposed in this study based on the strip analysis method and the 2 D shear stress transport (SST) k-w model. The validity of 2 D SST k-w model for VAWTs is assessed by comparing simulation results with those obtained by 2. 5 D large eddy simulation (LES). The influences of the tower, arms and turbulent inflow on the aerodynamic forces of the blades are further studied. The results show that the wind pressure and aerodynamic forces simulated by the 2 D SST k-w model match well with those obtained by 2. 5 D LES. The influences of the mean wind speed profile, turbulence, and interaction of all the components can be included in the proposed method at an acceptable computation cost. The influence of the tower is unapparent while the influence of the arms is obvious. The tangential force, and thus the power coefficient, is reduced due to the existence of the arms. The turbulent inflow wind speed causes fluctuation in the wind loads. In addition to wind loads, a precise finite element (FE) model is also needed for the structural analysis. The blades of modern wind turbines are made of laminated composite materials. In this thesis, an FE model of blades is established using laminated shell elements and a micromechanics-based model updating method is proposed to update the laminar elastic constants of the FE model. Analyses of sensitivity and uncertainty are conducted to determine the parameters of micromechanics models to be updated. Static bending tests are conducted and the measured data are used to update the models. The results show that by applying micromechanics models to the process of updating laminar elastic constants, direct identification of these constants can be avoided. In addition, the number of updating parameters can be reduced. It is found that the fiber volume fraction is the most influential parameter with the largest uncertainty for both unidirectional fiber reinforced plastic (UD FRP) and plain <b>weave</b> fiber reinforced <b>plastic</b> (PW FRP). After updating the fiber volume fractions for UP FRP and PW FRP based on the measured strains and displacements, both the calculated local strains and the global displacement match well with the measured data. A framework for the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of composite blades is proposed. First, a refined FE model of a laminated composite straight blade is established. Based on the FE model, fatigue analyses are conducted and the influences of the ultimate tensile and compressive strains, damping ratio and fundamental frequency on fatigue damage are studied. Ultimate strength analysis at the extreme wind speed is also conducted and the influence of wind direction on the response of blade is considered. The results show that for the specific composite straight blade considered, the locations at the supports and the mid-span of the blade have larger fatigue damage than other positions of the blade. The positions subjected to compressive cyclic loads have the larger fatigue damage than those subjected to tensile cyclic loads. The fatigue damage is sensitive to the damping ratio and fundamental frequency. The critical locations of strength failure are near the supports. The largest interlaminar shear stresses occur near the supports while the largest interlaminar normal stresses occur at the leading edge, not in the support section. A framework for fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of other components of VAWTs is also proposed. A FE model of the VAWT is established by beam elements. The rotating frame method is used to eliminate the rigid motion of the VAWT. Based on the FE model, fatigue and ultimate strength analyses are then conducted. The results show that the largest fatigue damage occurs {{at the root of the}} main arms. The fatigue critical location of the tower is at the bottom. It is found that larger fatigue damage occurs in the leeward side of the tower. For the rotor, the strength failure critical locations are the roots of main arm and the shaft. Assuming that the direction of the extreme wind speed is at the azimuth angle of 0 â°, the dangerous azimuth angles of the main arm are 60 â° and 240 â°; the dangerous azimuth angles of the shaft are 30 â°, 150 â° and 270 â°. For the tower, the fatigue critical location is at the bottom and in the leeward side and the dangerous azimuth angles are 30 â°, 150 â° and 270 â°. Field tests of a straight-bladed VAWT are conducted to validate the proposed frameworks for the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of VAWTs. The power spectrum densities (PSDs) of the measured responses are calculated under different conditions. Natural frequencies are determined from the peaks of the normalized PSDs of measured responses. The FE model of the VAWT is updated by the identified natural frequencies. By comparing the simulated responses with the corresponding measured data in the frequency domain, it is found that these two results match well with each other. Therefore, the proposed frameworks are validated to some extent. The pitch control system for large-scale VAWTs is proposed. The operation of VAWTs can be divided into four states: start-up above the cut-in wind speed, operation under the rated wind speed, operation above the rated wind speed, and shut-down over the cut-out wind speed. To improve the power generation, self-starting and shut-down performance of straight-bladed VAWTs, two pitch control algorithms,the fixed pitch (in one revolution) and the variable pitch (in one revolution), are studied for the four states using the double multiple streamtube theory (DMST). It is found that the sinusoidal pitch algorithm produces better control results than the fixed pitch algorithm. Based on these studies, a pitch control system is defined. Two sets of data acquisition and processing devices are used, one for the rotating parts and the other for the stationary parts. Furthermore, based on the results of fatigue and ultimate strength analyses, a SHM system is proposed for the VAWT. Anemometers are installed to monitor the wind condition; a tachometer is installed to monitor the rotational speed and the azimuth angle; strains gauges are installed at the critical locations of fatigue and ultimate strength failure to monitor the local deformations; accelerometers are installed to monitor global deformations; and load cells are installed to monitor the service loads. Similar to the control system, two sets of data acquisition and processing devices are used. Synthesizing the SHM system, control system and power supply, a smart VAWT concept is defined. Such a smart VAWT has self-sensing, self-inspecting, self-control and self-power capabilities. Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringPh.
