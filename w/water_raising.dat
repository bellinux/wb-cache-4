25|$|The plan, code-named Operation 'Wild Rose', is {{a plot to}} use black mercenaries in a {{terrorist}} attack on the United States to discredit the AAR and win sympathy for the white minority government in South Africa. De Vaal recruits Captain Patrick McKenzie Fawkes, late of the Royal Navyand who believes his family was slaughtered by the AARto lead the attack. The plan calls for Fawkes {{to take control of}} the former U.S. battleship Iowawhich has been sold for scrap and purchased by an AAR holding companyand strip her down to raise her draft and allow her to ride much higher in the <b>water.</b> <b>Raising</b> the draft enables Fawkes to sail the ship up the Potomac River and proceed with the plan for an attack by shelling Washington D.C.|$|E
500|$|The Colton {{investment}} {{sought to}} give an income while the Syndicates' greater hope was developed— a new iron mine near {{the foot of the}} incline at Timwood. The concept was to mine laterally into the foot of the hill rather than downwards from the top, which inevitably involved significant costs in pumping <b>water,</b> <b>raising</b> ore and lowering it again. Like Colton Pit, Timwood used [...] gauge hopper wagons underground. At Colton they were pushed to the 2ft gauge tracks described above. The ore was tipped onto a stockpile then gravity-fed into 2ft tipplers which were taken to the standard gauge line, tipped again then lowered down the original incline. At Timwood the 16 inch gauge tipplers were to be pushed a short distance to the standard gauge line and tipped once, completely bi-passing both narrow and standard gauge inclines.|$|E
500|$|By the 1940s, al-Birwa {{had three}} olive oil presses, a mosque, a church, and {{approximately}} 300 houses. In {{addition to the}} Ottoman-era boys' school, an elementary school for girls was established in 1943. By this time, many of the inhabitants lost {{all or part of}} their lands due to debts, and concurrently, men and women from al-Birwa increasingly worked in public projects, such as road construction and the Haifa oil refinery, or in British military installations, to compensate for lost income. [...] However, the main source of income remained agriculture, and the village's principal crops were olives, wheat, barley, corn, sesame, and watermelons. In 1944/45, residents of the village owned a total of 600 cattle, 3,000 goats and 1,000 chickens. Women, particularly young women from smaller landowning families, participated alongside the men of their family in working the land, while many women from landless families drew income as seasonal workers on other village residents' lands. There were general, gender-based divisions of labor, with women collecting well <b>water,</b> <b>raising</b> livestock, curdling milk, transporting goods to markets in Acre and collecting herbs; men typically plowed and sowed seeds, and both men and women picked olives and harvested crops.|$|E

60|$|There {{had been}} no meat save bacon since the McChesneys had left, for of late game had become scarce, and old Mr. Ripley was too feeble {{to go on the}} long hunts. So one day, when Polly Ann was gone across the ridge, I took down the long rifle from the buckhorns over the hearth, and the hunting knife and powder-horn and pouch beside it, and trudged up the slope to a game trail I discovered. All day I waited, until the forest light grew gray, when a buck came and stood over the <b>water,</b> <b>raising</b> his head and {{stamping}} from time to time. I took aim in the notch of a sapling, brought him down, cleaned and skinned and dragged him into the water, and triumphantly hauled one of his hams down the trail. Polly Ann gave a cry of joy when she saw me.|$|E

50|$|Hadrosaur eggshell {{fragments}} are however {{present in}} two microfossil {{sites in the}} area.

5000|$|Savi's {{pipistrelle}} {{feeds on}} flying insects which it catches {{on the wing}} using echolocation to locate its prey.

50|$|A typical launch {{sequence}} would {{start with the}} rocket being refurbished and mated to its cargo and ballast tanks on shore. The RP-1 and nitrogen would also be loaded at this point. The rocket would then be towed to a launch site, where the LOX and LH2 would be generated on-site using electrolysis; Truax suggested using a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier as a power supply during this phase. The ballast tanks, which {{also served as a}} cap and protection for the first stage engine bell, would then be filled with <b>water,</b> <b>raising</b> the rocket to vertical. Last minute checks could then be carried out, and the rocket launched.|$|E

With the death of Montemayor, his son Diego replaced him in office but died the following year. The viceroy then appointed Lieutenant General Agustin de Zavala. He was a rich Zacatecas miner and managed the city through magistrates. Successively these magistrates were Cristobal de Irurrea, Diego Rodriguez and Alonso Lucas el Bueno.|$|E

50|$|The gopher frog is on {{the verge}} of extinction. Putting the frog on the {{endangered}} species list requires locals to receive a permit to kill or take one of the frogs from the wild; however, the species is so endangered that it would require an additional recovery plan in order to guide the species back to a healthy population level. Fortunately, a conservation team has been deployed in order to manage the recovery of the gopher frog by managing the habitat, supplementing habitat with sufficient <b>water,</b> <b>raising</b> tadpoles for release, constructing or restoring new breeding sites, and managing ecological requirements and diseases. Another recovery option available for the gopher frog is the introduction of more gopher tortoises for the gopher frogs in order to widen their habitats.|$|E

40|$|This review {{outlines}} current knowledge concerning {{fluid intake}} and volume homeostasis in ageing. The physiology of vasopressin is summarized. Studies {{have been carried}} out to determine orthostatic changes in plasma volume and to assess the effect of water ingestion in normal subjects, elderly subjects, and patients with dysautonomias. About 14 % of plasma volume shifts out of the vasculature within 30 minutes of upright posture. Oral ingestion of <b>water</b> <b>raises</b> blood pressure in individuals with impaired autonomic reflexes and is an important source of noise in blood pressure trials in the elderly. On the average, oral ingestion of 16 ounces (473 ml) of <b>water</b> <b>raises</b> blood pressure 11 mmHg in elderly normal subjects. In patients with autonomic impairment, such as multiple system atrophy, strikingly exaggerated pressor effects of water have been seen with blood pressure elevations greater than 75 mmHg not at all uncommon. Ingestion of water is a major determinant of blood pressure in the elderly population. Volume homeostasis is importantly affected by posture and large changes in plasma volume may occur within 30 minutes when upright posture is assumed...|$|R
