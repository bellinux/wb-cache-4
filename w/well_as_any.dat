5|$|Homosexual {{interpretations of}} Batman have {{continued}} into the 21st century. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. In summer 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolours depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses.

5|$|On October 15, 1966, the Historic Preservation Act {{created the}} National Register of Historic Places and the {{corresponding}} State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO).

5|$|Ailred of Rievaulx, a near-contemporary chronicler, {{recorded}} Edmund's {{marriage to}} {{the daughter of a}} Hungarian king, but omitted to mention the name of the king {{and the name of the}} daughter. This could not have been a daughter of King Stephen, although a sister of King Samuel Aba, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other princess of the huge Árpád dynasty is a possible candidate. It is possible that Edmund's wife was named Hedwig. Edmund died shortly after the marriage, possibly during the military campaign of Andrew of Hungary in 1046. The Crowland Psalter records that Edmund died on 10 January, but not the year; he was certainly dead by 1054, when only Edward was recalled to England by the princes' uncle, King Edward the Confessor. The king wanted to appoint his nephew as his heir, however Edward died soon after his arrival in London. With the death of Edward's son, Edgar the Ætheling (who had been proclaimed king in 1066 but was forced to swear allegiance to William the Conqueror and renounce his rights), around 1126, the male line of the House of Wessex died out. Edmund was buried in Hungary, however the exact location of his grave is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as {{a small price to pay}} to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E

Although the British had prohibited transports from being in the Channel at night in anticipation of a German raid, the Dover Barrage was not prepared to meet such an attack. Facing Schröder′s 23 boats, the Dover Barrage was guarded by only the old destroyer , the yacht Ombra, and the naval trawler H. E. Straud. The four divisions of drifters manning the barrage′s anti-submarine nets were armed with only a single rifle each for defence. In addition to the forces guarding the Barrage, there were six Tribal-class destroyers at Dover that could be called upon {{in the event of a}} raid as well as several units of Harwich Force dispersed at the Downs.|$|E
5|$|Within a few hours, {{a second}} column of {{infantry}} assaulted the town from the northwest. Five or six tanks {{at the head}} of the column infiltrated Chonan and began destroying all vehicles in sight, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> buildings suspected of harboring Americans. Around 0600, infantry from the northwest column began flooding into the city and engaged in an intense and confused battle with the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment in the streets of Chonan. 3rd Battalion managed to destroy two of the tanks with rockets and grenades, but the column was able to cut off two companies of the 3rd Battalion from the rest of the force. Around 0800, Martin was killed by a North Korean tank when he fired a 2.36-inch bazooka at a North Korean T-34 tank at the same time it fired its main cannon at the building he was in. He had been in command of the 34th Infantry Regiment for only 14 hours. The tank was undamaged by Martin's shot, as the weapon was obsolete and could not penetrate T-34 armor.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, {{so much so that the}} new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|E
5|$|Hauptmann Koch divided his force {{into four}} assault groups. Group Granite, under Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig, {{composed}} of eighty-five men in eleven gliders whose task {{would be to}} assault and capture Fort Eben Emael; Group Steel, commanded by Oberleutnant Gustav Altmann, and formed of ninety-two men and nine gliders, would capture the Veldwezelt bridge; Group Concrete, commanded by Leutnant Gerhard Schacht and composed of ninety-six men in eleven gliders, would capture the Vroenhoven bridge; and Group Iron, under Leutnant Martin Schächter, composed of ninety men in ten gliders, who would capture the Kanne bridge. The crucial element for the assault force, particularly Group Granite, was time. It was believed {{that the combination of}} a noiseless approach by the gliders used by the assault force, and the lack of a declaration of war by the German government, would give the attackers the element of surprise. However, German estimates were that this would last, at the most, for sixty minutes, after which the superior numbers of the Belgian forces defending the fort and the bridges, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> reinforcements sent to the area, would begin to come to bear against the relatively small number of lightly armed airborne troops. The German plan, therefore, was to eliminate within those sixty minutes as many anti-aircraft positions and individual cupolas and casemates as was possible, and at all costs to put out of action the long-range artillery pieces which covered the three bridges. The destruction of these guns was expected to be completed within ten minutes; within this time the airborne troops would have to break out of their gliders, cover the distance to the guns, fix the explosive charges to the barrels of the guns and detonate them, all while under enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 1166, Becket excommunicated {{a number}} of his opponents, some {{specifically}} by name, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> who opposed his cause. Henry's response was to order the English bishops to appeal to the pope, which they did at a council that Foliot organised and led in London on 24 June. The appeal was written by Foliot, and a separate letter from the bishops, also written by Foliot, was sent to the archbishop. The bishops rested their case on the fact that those excommunicated had not been warned or allowed to defend themselves. They pointed out to the pope that the king had not escalated the conflict and had behaved reasonably to the last papal overtures in the summer of 1165. Becket replied to these moves with a letter written to Foliot that was full of resentment and reproaches. Foliot's reply, in a letter that is usually titled Multiplicem nobis, set forth his view of Becket's abilities as archbishop as well as giving reasons why Becket was wrong. He then suggested that the archbishop compromise and exercise some humility in order to reach his goals. By the end of 1166, Foliot managed to resign his custody of the confiscated Canterbury benefices, something he had been attempting to do for some time, thus removing one source of conflict between him and Becket.|$|E
