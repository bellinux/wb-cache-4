5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E

500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since." ...|$|E
500|$|Neil Strauss of The New York Times, while {{complimentary}} on the album's overall quality, {{noted that}} Dookies pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. The band {{did not respond}} initially to these comments, but later claimed that they were [...] "just trying to be themselves" [...] and that [...] "it's our band, we can do <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> want". Dirnt claimed that the follow-up album, Insomniac, one of the band's hardest albums lyrically and musically, was the band releasing their anger at all the criticism from critics and former fans.|$|E
500|$|The genus name Spongiforma {{refers to}} the sponge-like nature of the fruit body, while the {{specific}} epithet squarepantsii is a Latinisation of the well-known cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants, whose shape was purported to share a resemblance to the fungus. Additionally, the authors note that the spore-bearing surface (the hymenium), when viewed with scanning electron microscopy, somewhat resembles a [...] "seafloor covered with tube sponges, reminiscent of the fictitious home of SpongeBob". Although the epithet was originally rejected by the editors of Mycologia as [...] "frivolous", Desjardin and colleagues insisted that [...] "we could name it <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> liked".|$|E

500|$|Soundgarden was {{the first}} grunge band to sign to a major label when the band joined the roster of A Records in 1989. However, Soundgarden did not achieve success initially, and only with {{successive}} album releases did the band meet with increased sales and wider attention. Bassist Ben Shepherd has not been receptive to the grunge label, saying in a 2013 interview [...] "That's just marketing. It's called rock and roll, or it's called punk rock or <b>whatever.</b> <b>We</b> never were Grunge, we were just a band from Seattle." [...] They were ranked No.14 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.|$|E

One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> decide to do, I want the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so we want it to be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2009, the Madame Tussauds wax {{museum in}} New York {{launched}} a wax sculpture of SpongeBob. SpongeBob {{is the first}} fictional character to be featured in Tussauds. In May 2011, a new species of mushroom, Spongiforma squarepantsii, was described in the journal Mycologia. The mushroom was named after the famous cartoon character.

The singles [...] "Foolin'", [...] "Photograph", and [...] "Rock of Ages", helped {{by the emergence of}} MTV, reached the Top 40. Pyromanias style was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian scene. However, remarked Leppard's Joe Elliott, [...] "I don't know how anybody could confuse us with that lot. We weren't even around when all those so-called glam bands came up. We were in fuckin' Holland making Hysteria. While they were out banging chicks or <b>whatever,</b> <b>we</b> were looking at windmills and playing pool on a table without any pockets. We were as far away from LA as any band could be." ...|$|E
500|$|In post-production, Wan {{found he}} did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was {{basically}} shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. [...] "We did {{a lot of things to}} fill in gaps throughout the film. <b>Whatever</b> <b>we</b> cut to newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or we cut to surveillance cameras, or we cut to still photography within the film, which now people say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because {{who knows how long}} the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week we just go and work on <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And if we do it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Michael Wylie, who {{had previously}} worked on Marvel Television's Agent Carter, found designing for Legion to be more flexible than other series, {{due to the lack}} of set continuity from scene to scene, though Hawley was very specific about his ideas for the series, and provided Wylie with a 'lookbook' for the show when first interviewing him for the job. To avoid dating the series, elements such as cars are rarely shown, and when they are seen there is a mixture of modern-day cars and vehicles from the 60s. Clothing is also a mixture of present-day and past fashions, emulating a prediction of the future from the 60s or 70s. Wylie explained that the [...] "story is being told from an unreliable narrator so we can do <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> want."

In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the [...] "ill-fated 1974 tour", Harrison [...] "continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface". Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982, Harrison said: Back in the sixties, <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> were all getting into, we tended to broadcast it as loud as we could. I had had certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I wanted to shout and tell it to everybody.

500|$|Clarkson had {{expressed}} interest in recording a Christmas album for years, having recorded various Christmas songs such as [...] "Oh Holy Night" [...] and [...] "My Grown Up Christmas List" [...] on the [...] (2003), [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas" [...] on iTunes Session (2011), and being featured on Blake Shelton's Christmas album Cheers, It's Christmas (2012). Weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre, she felt that recording a Christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres. She remarked, [...] "I always get asked what genre I'm in: 'Is this country or pop or rock? What are you?' And what's cool about making the Christmas album was, 'Oh, there are no limitations! We can do <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> want!'". She further added, [...] "The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn't matter what mood you're in or {{what kind of a}} year you've had—it's a fresh start. I'm going to clear the air and take stock of the good that's happened." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, New Line Cinema {{bought the}} rights to produce an English-language remake with Guillermo del Toro as producer.

On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced as the director of the American remake. Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake, stating [...] "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then I got into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.|$|E

But we wanted to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil."
