In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, {{to act as a}} supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. [...] "Heaven help us all if <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Key was {{implicated in}} the arrest of Kim Dotcom and the {{subsequent}} revelations that the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had illegally spied on Dotcom. As Prime Minister, Key was directly responsible for the GCSB, which {{is not allowed to}} spy on New Zealand citizens – and Dotcom had been granted permanent residency. Three days later, [...] Key apologised for the illegal spying. [...] "I apologize to Mr Dotcom. I apologize to New Zealanders because every New Zealander…is entitled to be protected from the law {{when it comes to the}} GCSB, and <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> provide that appropriate protection for him."

500|$|In May, Benfica had {{two games}} in which to {{overcome}} a four-point deficit. On the fourth, they played Estrela da Amadora away. Benfica never beat Estrela's goalkeeper, Pedro Alves, drawing 0–0 and losing crucial points. Chalana said, [...] "We started the first half somewhat nervous. Not playing our best. However, the second half was different, we did everything to win, created opportunities but the ball just would not go in." [...] The draw left Benfica dependent on others to reach second place; even if they won, Sporting had to lose and Guimarães had to lose or draw. On 11 May, the club hosted Vitória de Setúbal. The match, attracting over 54,000 fans for Rui Costa's last game, was a 3–0 Benfica win. Sporting and Guimarães also won and Benfica finished fourth, missing a Champions League berth. It was their fifth finish outside the top three after fourth-place finishes in 1939–40, 1940–41 and 2001–02 and a sixth-place finish in 2000–01. Chalana said, [...] "Benfica is very big. <b>We</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> reach our objectives, but nearly sold out the stadium today." [...] The club's season ended with an African tour in which they defeated a team with players from Sal and São Vicente on 17 May and the Angolan national team two days later.|$|E

A scene in a dentist office reminded him of a scene from Spider-Man 2, a film also directed by Raimi. He commented that [...] "even in his small part Campbell is the most memorable character in the film", also praising the performance of the two exterminators.

2500|$|Battle of Chickamauga – In September 1863, Longstreet's Corps {{left the}} armies of {{northern}} Virginia by rail to join the Battle of Chickamauga in northwest Georgia, near Dalton. The corps bolstered the forces of General Bragg's Army of Tennessee. He used these reinforcements in a vicious two-day battle, September 19 and 20, gaining {{one of the few}} confederate victories in the southwest. But, the 18th Georgia Regiment did not participate since they only arrived on the field the day after the battle. The Union forces, under the command of General Rosencrans, fell back into Chattanooga, Tennessee. Instead of vigorously pursuing Rosencrans and pressing the siege of Chattanooga, General Bragg encircled the city hoping to starve the Union commander into surrendering. But, by Oct 23rd, General Grant had arrived and the river route to Bridgeport was opened, the threat of starvation ended. Longstreet wrote after the war, [...] "Our last opportunity was lost when <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> follow the success at Chickamauga and capture or disperse the Union army." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{development}} of critical reflection in teachers {{is an issue}} of concern to teacher educators. Finding ways to foster that development becomes increasingly important as the schools continue to change with unprecedented rapidity. This paper reports the results of study that looked at whether computer conferencing could be used to help students of teaching become more aware of taken-for-granted assumptions ~ a crucial aspect of critical reflection. The following two questions guided our study. First, do conferencing activities generate opportunities for the identification and discussion of taken-for-granted assumptions and, if so, what types of assumptions? Second, do conferencing activities provide insight into the relationship between student development and the ability to identify and clarify taken-for-granted assumptions? The range of what we think and do is limited by what <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice. And because <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice that <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice there is little we can do to change until we notic...|$|R

Many in the squadron were rather surprised as {{there has been}} nothing exciting, that the pock-marked lines seemed so quiet, and no Germans were in the air. The fact was that <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> realize the danger, but that was soon to change. Over {{the next several days}} the squadron began a routine of three scheduled patrols, lasting about an hour each, and then three or four voluntary patrols each day. On 4 June, the squadron performed seven patrols with the object of keeping enemy observation photographers from coming over. [...] The squadron engaged in combat with the German Air Force on several patrols, and on 13 June, Lt Plyer was reported missing after being shot down in a combat with German planes, and later was reported to be a prisoner. In the days that followed, saw a continence of these same types of patrols. [...] On 25 June, orders came to be ready to move to the Chateau Thierry Sector.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{religious}} leaders oppose the embargo {{for a variety}} of reasons, including humanitarian and economic hardships the embargo imposes on Cubans. Pope John Paul II called for the end to the embargo during his 1979 pastoral visit to Mexico. Patriarch Bartholomew I called the embargo a [...] "historic mistake" [...] while visiting the island on January 25, 2004. A joint letter in 1998 from the Disciples of Christ and the United Church of Christ to the U.S. Senate called for the easing of economic restrictions against Cuba. While also opposing the embargo, the General Secretary of the National Council of Churches stated, [...] "We did not understand the depth of the suffering of Christians under communism. And <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> really cry out under the communist oppression." [...] Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton, and Minister Louis Farrakhan have also publicly opposed the embargo. On May 15, 2002 former President Jimmy Carter spoke in Havana, calling {{for an end to the}} embargo, saying [...] "Our two nations have been trapped in a destructive state of belligerence for 42 years, and it is time for us to change our relationship."

2500|$|In June 1972, Title IX of the [...] "Education Amendments Act of 1972" [...] was passed, and {{it brought}} the {{beginning}} of the most significant change in the history of Alpha Kappa Psi. [...] Title IX prohibited sex discrimination in federally assisted educational programs and amended parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While social fraternities and sororities were exempt from the provisions of Title IX, professional fraternities were included in Title IX. Around this time, the brothers of the Delta Chi Chapter at Clarkson University introduced legislation to amend Alpha Kappa Psi's Constitution to include women as brothers. While this move did gain the support of a few other chapters, the proposed amendments were easily defeated. [...] In the fall of 1973, the Delta Chi chapter admitted four women into their Chapter and soon granted females full rights and privileges, including participation in ritual. [...] Delta Chi went on to elect a female president and attempted to send her to the 1974 national convention as their voting delegate. [...] As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi revoked the charter of the Delta Chi Chapter. The chapter proceeded by changing its name to Delta Chi Delta aiming to be completely independent from its former counterpart. During the same year, the Alpha Kappa Chapter at the University of Idaho also admitted women to membership. As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi also moved forward with disciplinary action against the Alpha Kappa Chapter. Upon having their charter revoked, the former Alpha Kappa Chapter continued on as an independent organization known as Pi Beta Sigma, and the organization's advisor remarked [...] "My sentiments are that if we are being excommunicated from the national because <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> discriminate against women, then it's a pleasure to get kicked out of that organization.|$|E
