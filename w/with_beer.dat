5|$|The Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations {{requires}} that the beer should {{be made by the}} alcoholic fermentation of yeast.

The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the cash register. The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E

5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>beer.</b> Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive {{growth in the number of}} microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|In many societies, beer is {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated <b>with</b> <b>beer</b> drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer. Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.|$|E
5|$|Montville {{suggested}} that Ruth is probably even more popular today {{than he was}} when his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, {{to the delight of}} the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight each evening during the season. The questions of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences <b>with</b> <b>beer</b> and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.|$|E

5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted <b>with</b> <b>beer</b> from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|I {{found they}} begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: {{a party of}} young people procure {{the head of a}} dead horse, which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length; a string is affixed to the lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also {{attached}} to the whole, under which one of the parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied {{by the rest of the}} party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified <b>with</b> <b>beer</b> and cake, or perhaps with money. This is called, provincially, a Hodening.|$|E

50|$|Beer was {{classified}} into tax classes by law in Finland {{until the year}} 1995 when Finland joined the European Union. After joining EU the law was reformed so that the tax is set directly by the percentage of alcohol by volume contained in the product: <b>with</b> 0.5-2.8% <b>beers</b> €0.02/cl of alcohol, <b>with</b> <b>beers</b> over 2.8% €0.0214/cl. However, the old classifications are still voluntarily used widely and the old tax classes are still often marked on the products and advertisements.|$|R

5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits {{at the mouth of the}} River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden {{staircase}} known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, <b>with</b> <b>Beer</b> Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.|$|E
5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball {{match with}} Steve McMichael as Special Guest Referee {{in the fifth}} contest. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defended the title against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money, Inc. to the ring. The duration of the bout was 20 minutes and 20 seconds. This bout was contested under no count-outs and no disqualification rules with weapons legal {{and the only way}} to win was for a competitor to either pin or make another wrestler submit. The match started off with Hernandez jumping over the top rope onto Roode and Storm. Several competitors bled during the contest, such as Devon and Abyss, who was cut open by a cheese grater by Ray. McMichael was directly involved in the match several times. The first being an altercation <b>with</b> <b>Beer</b> Money, Inc., resulting in McMichael attacking Roode. Another time was near the end of the contest when Jacqueline interrupted a pin attempt by Homicide on Storm, with McMichael spanking her in retaliation. The last time was when he aided Hernandez in opening a tied bag of thumbtacks. Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter when Team 3D were assaulting Abyss with various weapons, such as a staple gun. Devine hit Abyss with a kendo stick from behind and helped Devon set up a table on the floor next to the stage. Ray and Devon then sprayed the table with lighter fluid. Devine lit the table on fire before Ray and Devon slammed Abyss through the flaming table off of the stage. The match ended when Team 3D forced Hernandez through a table covered in thumbtacks with their signature 3D tag team maneuver, before Storm spat beer in Devon's eyes and Roode covered Hernandez for the pinfall to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
