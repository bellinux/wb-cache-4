Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) becomes concerned and suggests that Olivia talk to Walter to help reverse the memory loss. During the case, in talking with the latest victim's wife, Olivia realizes that she is truly in love with Peter. After {{the conclusion of the}} case, she admits to Nina that she <b>will</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> memory alterations continue, even if this means she will forget the times she spent with Nina during her childhood.|$|E

Cally's blood is {{to be used as a}} vaccine for the virus. Cally and Stirling board the gunship, while Sinclair chooses to stay behind. Nelson flies into the quarantine zone to speak with Sinclair and she gives him a recording of the conversation, the evidence to bring down Canaris. The recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang. Looking at the head, the marauders cheer, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.|$|E

25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} {{can buy a}} put option to sell the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date. The trader will be {{under no obligation to}} sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price, he <b>will</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another {{latching}} region would allow for the latching of two input values at the two different outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new latching region configured to process data only when both latching regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the same instant. Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, latching regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to latching region 7. At this instant, latching region 7 <b>will</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the latching regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E

Rather, its intent is to stylize and codify the facial expressions through {{the use of the}} mask and to stimulate the imagination of the audience.

As Jack gets more and more drunk, he reveals that he still has various fantasies about his wife from grabbing one of her breasts to her getting various terminal diseases with him by her bedside. Eventually, he picks up a prostitute (Rachel Dratch), and the two interrupt Tracy and Angie's Valentine's Day at the Soho Grand Hotel. Angie, upset that their Valentine's Day is ruined, demands that Tracy get rid of Jack and the prostitute, so he calls Liz for help. Liz gets Jack and the drunk prostitute out of the hotel, and Liz tells Jack that his relationship with his wife is sick and presents him with a scenario of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill", all with his wife, causing Jack to say that he wants to do all of the three but promises Liz that he will get over his wife, and the two leave the prostitute in the street. The next day, Jack and Bianca sign the divorce papers, and Bianca begs Jack not to sell the Arby's that he had gotten in their settlement. He promises not to do so, but <b>will</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> place shut down and become desolate.

2500|$|During December 1914, Nicholas II of Russia {{visited the}} Caucasus Front. In the {{presence}} of the head of the Armenian Church and alongside Alexander Khatisyan president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis, Nicholas II stated: [...] "Armenians from all countries are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army, and with their blood, to serve the victory of the Russian Army... Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus, let all the peoples (Christians) remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom through your <b>will.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>the</b> Armenian people of Turkey, who have suffered for the faith of Christ, receive resurrection for a new and free life...". Ottoman War Minister Enver Pasha wanted to encircle the Russian forces between Sarikamish and Ardahan. The Battle of Sarikamish (29 December 1914 – 4 January 1915) was a disastrous defeat for Enver Pasha. For their role in this success, the Armenian volunteers received credit as natives of the region, well adjusted to the climate, familiar with every road and mountain path, and motivated to wage fierce and resolute combat. The Armenian volunteers were small, mobile units, well adapted to semi-guerrilla warfare. They worked efficiently as scouts, though they also took active roles in many conventional engagements. Armenian volunteers challenged the Ottoman operations during critical times: [...] "the delay they caused, enabled the Russian Caucasus Army to concentrate sufficient force around Sarikamish". After he returned to Constantinople, Enver blamed his defeat on Armenians living in the region, for actively siding with Russia.|$|E
2500|$|After {{seven years}} at college, Thomas R. [...] "Tommy" [...] Callahan III (Chris Farley) barely {{graduates}} from Marquette University {{and returns to}} his hometown of Sandusky, Ohio. His father, industrialist and widower Thomas R. [...] "Big Tom" [...] Callahan, Jr. (Brian Dennehy), gives him an executive job at the family's auto parts plant, Callahan Auto. In addition to the new job and office, Big Tom reveals {{that he plans to}} marry Beverly Barrish-Burns (Bo Derek), a woman he had met at a fat farm, and that her son Paul (Rob Lowe) will become Tommy's new stepbrother. At the wedding, Big Tom suddenly dies of a heart attack. After the funeral, doubting the future of the company without Big Tom, the bank reneges on promises of a loan for a new brake pad division and seeks immediate payment of Callahan Auto's debts. Ray Zalinsky (Dan Aykroyd), owner and operator of rival automotive parts company Zalinsky Auto Parts in Chicago, offers to buy them out while the company's shares are high, but Tommy suggests a deal: he <b>will</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> bank hold his inherited shares and house in exchange for helping to sell the new brake pads. The bank agrees, but they also want the company to prove it still has viability by selling 500,000 brake pads. If they fail, the bank will foreclose, but if they succeed, the bank will underwrite Big Tom's brake pad venture. Tommy volunteers to go on a cross-country sales trip with his father's sycophantic assistant, Richard Hayden (David Spade), a childhood acquaintance who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Tommy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the article}} [...] "Revolutionary Ideals are Higher than Heaven-Studying" [...] (published in 2013), a person writing under the pen name [...] "Autumn Stone", {{supports}} Xi Jinping's policy of strengthening the ideological conviction of party cadres, since (as the Leninist mantra goes) ideological unity leads to party unity. The writer claims [...] "Ideals and convictions are the spiritual banners {{for the united}} struggle of a country, nation and party, wavering ideals and convictions are the most harmful form of wavering." [...] Adhering to the ideals and convictions of the party creates {{a link between the}} party and the masses, and <b>will</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> party [...] "gain victories wherever" [...] it goes. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the core spiritual values of members have become more important than ever, considering the restrengthened position of world capitalism. Xi Jinping believes that wavering conviction in the party's ideals lead to increased corruption and unwanted behaviour. Exemplary members have existed before, such as Xia Minghan who said [...] "Don’t fear being beheaded, as long as one’s ism is true", Yang Chao’s [...] "The heaven’s are full of rain, wind and worry, for the Revolution, it is unnecessary to fear losing one’s head" [...] and Fang Zhimin's statement that [...] "The enemy can only cut off our heads, but cannot shake our beliefs!" [...] The author suggest that these men were incorruptible because they carried the party's ideals and convictions. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, the writer suggests, was in key parts due to the ideological wavering of officials; claiming that even Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, had acknowledged in private that communist ideals had become obsolete to him. Disintegration in the ideological arena can lead to breaches {{in other areas of the}} party's edifice, paving the way for party collapse, the author states.|$|E
