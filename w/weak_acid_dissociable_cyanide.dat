40|$|A {{flow system}} {{designed}} with solenoid valves is proposed for determination of <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable</b> <b>cyanide,</b> {{based on the}} reaction with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and glycine yielding a highly fluorescent isoindole derivative. The proposed procedure minimizes the main drawbacks related to the reference batch procedure, based on reaction with barbituric acid and pyridine followed by spectrophotometric detection, i. e., use of toxic reagents, high reagent consumption and waste generation, low sampling rate, and poor sensitivity. Retention of the sample zone was exploited to increase the conversion rate of the analyte with minimized sample dispersion. Linear response (r= 0. 999) was observed for cyanide concentrations in the range 1 - 200 mu g L(- 1), with a detection limit (99. 7 % confidence level) of 0. 5 mu g L(- 1) (19 nmol L(- 1)). The sampling rate and coefficient of variation (n= 10) were estimated as 22 measurements per hour and 1. 4 %, respectively. The results of determination of <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable</b> <b>cyanide</b> in natural water samples were in agreement with those achieved by the batch reference procedure at the 95 % confidence level. Additionally to the improvement in the analytical features in comparison {{with those of the}} flow system with continuous reagent addition (sensitivity and sampling rate 90 and 83 % higher, respectively), the consumption of OPA was 230 -fold lower...|$|E
30|$|Optimization {{steps were}} performed, {{and the results}} of this {{experiments}} showed that at the first condition, with the points suggested by the software (130  rpm, 44  °C and 4.06 % inoculation amount), cyanide biodegradation percentage is estimated to be 86 %, while in the second condition proposed by the software at 30  °C, 230  rpm, and 1.98 % inoculation amount, percentage of cyanide biodegradation is estimated to be about 84.5 %. However, in another study, the isolated microbial species were optimized through the numerical optimization technique and the optimized condition was temperature 33.60  °C, pH 9.88 and whey-waste concentration of 14.27  g L− 1, which can biodegrade an initial cyanide concentration of 500 – 206.53  mg L− 1 in 96  h (Mekuto et al. 2015). Bacillus sp. CN- 22 can tolerate the highest CN− concentration of 700  mg L− 1. Under the optimized condition given by RSM, it can also achieve the highest degradation of CN− at 96.69 %, by reducing CN− concentrations from 200 to 6.62  mg L− 1 in 72  h (Wu et al. 2014). However, for biodegradation of cyanide with an initial CN− concentration of 1  mg L− 1 in 3  min, 90 % can be removed. This is used for residual cyanide from wastewater treatment with low cyanide concentrations (Hijosa-Valsero et al. 2013). When equipment in the laboratory is not sufficient for conducting the experiment under optimized conditions and the implementation of this process is limited, the second condition is preferred. With regard to Eq.  2, {{at any time during the}} performance of this experiment, the result can be obtained by the replacement of the factor values in the equation without needing to perform all the steps for the biodegradation process optimization. Therefore decision can be taken with regard to whether degradation percentage is acceptable. The results of this optimization show that Bacillus sp. M 01 PTCC 1908 can degrade 651.2  mg L− 1 initial cyanide concentration to 562.5  mg L− 1 in 48  h (i.e. 86.4 %). A study by Kao et al. reported that cyanide concentration higher than 2.6  mg L− 1 can induce a longer lag phase and t test result determined that the difference between growths at cyanide concentration above 13  mg L− 1 was not significant. In another research, performed by Akcil et al., the ability of degrading <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable</b> <b>cyanide</b> (CNWAD) at 400  ppm cyanide concentration was evaluated and the efficiency was found to be nearly 90 % (Akcil et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|Cyanide {{has been}} widely used as a {{depressant}} in sulphide mineral flotation. It occasionally activates mineral flotation as well. In addition, cyanide species in the water from gold cyanidation process may be recycled to flotation circuits and have an inadvertent effect on mineral flotation. Therefore, the investigation on mineral flotation {{in the presence of}} cyanide with different speciation is of great importance. Even after decades of research, the mechanisms of cyanide depression and activation processes are not fully understood and effective ways to solve problems encountered in minerals flotation plants using cyanide-containing recycled water are not currently available. In this paper, a review of previous literature on the effect of free <b>cyanide,</b> <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable</b> (WAD) <b>cyanide</b> and strong <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable</b> (SAD) <b>cyanide</b> on the flotation of base metal and precious minerals is presented, with a particular focus on the underpinning mechanisms and process solutions.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines, U. S. Department of the Interior, is {{investigating}} biodegradation of cyanide {{as a means}} of decommissioning heap leach operations.

The tests were conducted both in trickling column reactors, using quartz as the growth surface, and in upflow columns, using activated carbon as the growth surface. In addition, exploratory tests indicated that bacteria will destroy residual cyanide in leached ore. A flowsheet has been proposed for closure of heap leach operations in which the metals processing portion of the plant, possibly the carbon adsorption columns, or a collection pond is used as a bioreactor. The cyanide in the process solution is destroyed in the bioreactor and the treated water is used to rinse residual cyanide from the spent heaps.

40|$|In gold {{processing}} plants, {{the process}} water contains {{a considerable amount}} of <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable</b> (WAD) <b>cyanide</b> species. The cyanide-containing water recycled to flotation circuits has a deleterious effect on mineral flotation. Zinc cyanide can be a major constituent of the process water due to the cyanide leaching of zinc minerals and the zinc cementation applied to precipitate gold and silver. In the present study, the effect of zinc cyanide on the flotation of gold from a pyritic ore was evaluated and the competitive adsorption between zinc cyanide species and the collector, potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) or Aerophine promoter (3418 A), on gold was studied by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). It was found that free cyanide did not depress the flotation of liberated gold, but zinc cyanide with a CN/Zn ratio of 2 did. The depression of gold flotation by zinc cyanide was due to the preferential adsorption of Zn(CN) on gold surface over either 3418 A or amyl xanthate in the solution, rendering gold surface hydrophilic. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Magister Technologiae: Chemical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 There are significant quantities of free cyanide (F-CN) and heavy metal contaminated effluent being discharged from electroplating operations globally. However, there is an overwhelming tendency in the industry to use physical and/or chemical treatment methods for cyanides (CNs) and heavy metals in effluent. Although these methods may be effective for certain CNs and heavy metals, they produce toxic by-products and also involve high operational and capital investment costs when compared to bioremediation methods. In this study, {{the design of a}} two-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) system was conceptualised for the bioremediation of CNs and heavy metals in the effluent which was collected from an electroplating facility located in the Western Cape, South Africa. The design included a primary inactive bioremediation stage, to reduce the impact of contaminate concentration fluctuations, and a secondary active bioremediation stage, to remove the residual contaminants, in the effluent under alkaline pH conditions which typify most industrial effluent containing these contaminants. An analysis of the electroplating effluent revealed that the effluent contained an average of 149. 11 (± 9. 31) mg/L, 5. 25 (± 0. 64) mg/L, 8. 12 (± 4. 78) mg/L, 9. 05 (± 5. 26) mg/L and 45. 19 (± 25. 89) mg/L of total <b>cyanide</b> (T-CN), F-CN, <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable</b> <b>cyanides</b> (WAD-CNs), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu), respectively. An Aspergillus sp., which displayed the characteristic black conidiophores of the Aspergillus section Nigri, was isolated from the electroplating facilities’ effluent discharge using a selective pectin agar (PA) and subcultured on 2 % (v/v) antibiotic (10, 000 units/L penicillin and 10 mg streptomycin/mL) potato dextrose agar (PDA). The isolate was tolerant to F-CN up to 430 mg F-CN/L on F-CN PDA plates which were incubated at 37 ˚C for 5 days. However, a significant decline in microbial growth was observed after 200 mg F-CN/L, thus indicating that the isolate was suitable for the bioremediation of the electroplating effluent. The identification of the isolate as Aspergillus awamori (A. awamori) was definitively determined using a multi-gene phylogenetic analysis, utilising ITS (internal transcribed spacer), -tubulin and calmodulin gene regions. Although an anomaly in the morphology of the conidia of the isolate was observed during the morphological analysis, indicating a possible morphological mutation in the isolate. A comparative study between “sweet orange” (Citrus sinensis (C. sinensis)) pomace, “apple” (Malus domestica (M. domestica)) pomace, “sweetcorn” (Zea mays (Z. mays)) cob and “potato” (Solanum tuberosum (S. tuberosum)) peel, i. e. waste materials considered to be agricultural residues, was conducted in order to assess their potential and as a sole carbon source supplement for A. awamori biomass development for the bioremediation of CNs and heavy metals. The suitability of these agricultural residues for these activities were as follows: C. sinensis pomace ˃ M. domestica pomace ˃ Z. mays cob ˃ S. tuberosum peel. For purpose of the sensitivity analysis, a temperature range of 20 to 50 ˚C and an alkaline pH range of 7 to 12 showed that: (1) optimal conditions for the uptake of Ni, Zn and Cu occurred at pH 12 and a temperature of 37. 91 and 39. 78 ˚C using active and inactive A. awamori biomass and unhydrolysed and hydrolysed C. sinensis pomace, respectively; (2) F-CN conversion increased linearly with an increase in pH and temperature using unhydrolysed and hydrolysed C. sinensis pomace; and (3) optimal conditions for the F-CN conversion and the respective by-products and sugar metabolism using active A. awamori biomass occurred at 37. 02 ˚C and pH 8. 75 and at conditions inversely proportional to F-CN conversion, respectively. The heavy metal affinity was Ni > Zn > Cu for all the biomaterials used and with the heavy metal uptake capacity being inactive A. awamori biomass > active A. awamori biomass > hydrolysed C. sinensis pomace > unhydrolysed C. sinensis pomace, respectively. Hydrolysed C. sinensis pomace had a 3. 86 fold higher conversion of F-CN compared to the unhydrolysed C. sinensis pomace. The use of C. sinensis pomace extract as a nutrient media, derived from the acid hydrolysis of C. sinensis pomace, showed potential as a rich carbon-based supplement and also that low concentrations, < 0. 1 % (v/v), were required for the bioremediation of CNs and heavy metals. The two-stage MBR system was operated at 40 ˚C since this temperature was conducive to the bioremediation of CN and heavy metals. The primary bioremediation stage contained hydrolysed C. sinensis pomace while the secondary bioremediation stage contained active A. awamori biomass, supplemented by the C. sinensis pomace extract. After the primary and secondary bioremediation stages, 76. 37 %, 95. 37 %, 93. 26 % and 94. 76 % (primary bioremediation stage) and 99. 55 %, 99. 91 %, 99. 92 % and 99. 92 % (secondary bioremediation stage) average bioremediation efficiencies for T-CN, Ni, Zn and Cu were achieved. Furthermore, the secondary bioremediation stage metabolised the CN conversion by-products with an efficiency of 99. 81 % and 99. 75 % for formate (CHOO-) and ammonium (NH 4 +), respectively. After the first, second and third acid regeneration cycles of the hydrolysed C. sinensis pomace, 99. 13 %, 99. 12 % and 99. 04 % (first regeneration cycle), 98. 94 %, 98. 92 % and 98. 41 % (second regeneration cycle) and 98. 46 %, 98. 44 % and 97. 91 % (third regeneration cycle) recovery efficiencies for Ni, Zn and Cu were achieved. However, the design only managed to treat the effluent for safe discharge and the use of a post-treatment stage, such as reverse osmosis, is recommended to remove the remainder of the trace contaminants and colour from the effluent to ensure that the effluent met the potable water standards for reuse. There was a relatively insignificant standard deviation (≤ 3. 22 %) detected in all the parameters measured in the continuous operation and this indicates the reproducibility of the bioremediation efficiency in this continuous system...|$|R
40|$|A new {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} both available (free and <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> <b>dissociable,</b> WAD) and total cyanides in industrial wastewaters has been developed. It {{is based on the}} static headspace (HS) sampling procedure followed by a GC separation and the selective nitrogen-phosphorous detection (NPD), in which different thermal treatment allows the speciation of total and available cyanides. Detection limits (0. 5 μg/L), recovery (84. 7 – 114. 6 % for free and 76. 8 – 121. 5 % for total cyanides) and precision (5 % at 5 μg/L), evaluated on both real and synthetic samples, were fit-for-purpose for the legal requirement (5 μg/L) enforced in the Venice lagoon, without significant interfering species. In addition, analytical results of the HS-GC-NPD method have been compared with those obtained using the 4500 CN and EN ISO 14403 official methods for the determination of total and free cyanides, respectively. The new method has been successfully applied for the determination of cyanide concentrations in main influent and final effluent to the Venice lagoon to verify the efficiency of the industrial wastewater treatment plant of Porto Marghera (Venice, Italy). The capability of the proposed method to detect the WAD cyanides has been tested by studying the acid dissociation of K 2 [Ni(CN) 4].

40|$|Acetic acid {{produces}} an irritating sensation {{that can be}} attributed to activation of nociceptors within the trigeminal ganglion that innervate the nasal or oral cavities. These sensory neurons sense a diverse array of noxious agents in the environment, allowing animals to actively avoid tissue damage. Although receptor mechanisms have been identified for many noxious chemicals, the mechanisms by which animals detect <b>weak</b> <b>acids,</b> such as acetic acid, are less well understood. <b>Weak</b> <b>acids</b> are only partially dissociated at neutral pH and, as such, some can cross the cell membrane, acidifying the cell cytosol. The nociceptor ion channel TRPA 1 is activated by CO 2, through gating of the channel by intracellular protons, making it a candidate to more generally mediate sensory responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids.</b> To test this possibility, we measured responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> from heterologously expressed TRPA 1 channels and trigeminal neurons with patch clamp recording and Ca 2 + microfluorometry. Our results show that heterologously expressed TRPA 1 currents can be induced by a series of <b>weak</b> organic <b>acids,</b> including acetic, propionic, formic, and lactic acid, but not by strong acids. Notably, the degree of channel activation was predicted by the degree of intracellular acidification produced by each acid, suggesting that intracellular protons are the proximate stimulus that gates the channel. Responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> produced a Ca 2 +-independent inactivation that precluded further activation by <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> or reactive chemicals, whereas preactivation by reactive electrophiles sensitized TRPA 1 channels to <b>weak</b> <b>acids.</b> Importantly, responses of trigeminal neurons to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> were highly overrepresented in the subpopulation of TRPA 1 -expressing neurons and were severely reduced in neurons from TRPA 1 knockout mice.

The increase in PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 levels is accompanied by a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, changes in PtdInsP 2 levels are independent of weak acid-induced Pdr 12 p expression. In contrast, changing the extracellular medium to alkaline pH provokes a prolonged and substantial rise in PtdIns(3, 5) P 2 levels. As PtdIns(3, 5) P 2 synthesis is required for correct vacuole acidification, it is possible that levels of this molecule are modulated to maintain intracellular pH homoeostasis in response to <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> and alkali stresses. In conclusion, we have expanded the repertoire of stress responses that affect PtdInsP 2 levels to include <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> and alkali stresses...|$|R
