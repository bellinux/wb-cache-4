I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E

25|$|On Monday nights, <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> have a ball. Everybody {{from the}} Apollo, on Monday nights, {{was a guest}} at Minton's, the whole band. We had a big jam session. Monday night was the big night, the musician's night off. There was always some food there for you. Oh, that part was beautiful. Teddy Hill treated the guys well.|$|E
25|$|Kevin Godley recalled:We {{did a lot}} {{of tracks}} {{in a very short time}} – it was really like a machine.

25|$|According to Robert McComb, {{the home}} {{inspired}} his famous brother, who loved the house:The {{house was the}} home of the band while we were in Perth.

25|$|The {{new record}} is coming along great! The new jams are high energy, and are gonna be a blast to play live. We're working on really using all three vocals, which <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do {{a bit more}} {{in the early days}} and works great, and people always seem to want more of, so that will be fun. But mostly I expect a great Dillinger Four record: fun, fast-paced, great change-ups and a couple songs on this one where it's a bit {{different}} than stuff we've done before.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E
25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised.

We also present the procedure <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> improve those models for a Broadcast News (BN) recognition task by interpolating them with a BN transcriptions based language model. Finally the paper details a method <b>used</b> <b>to</b> generate morpheme-based language models...|$|R

500|$|After the {{unpleasant}} recording sessions {{for the proposed}} Get Back album (ultimately released in 1970 as Let It Be), Paul McCartney suggested to music producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album [...] "the way <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do it", free of the conflict that had begun {{following the death of}} Brian Epstein and carried over to the sessions for the White Album. Martin agreed, but on the strict condition that all the group – particularly John Lennon – allow him to produce the record {{in the same manner as}} earlier albums and that discipline would be adhered to.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's {{previous}} two albums, Wasting Light {{was recorded in}} Dave Grohl's garage in Encino, California, {{as opposed to the}} band's home-built studio, Studio 606. Regarding this decision, Grohl states: [...] "There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage. Why go into the most expensive studio with the biggest producer and use the best state-of-the-art equipment? Where's the rock'n'roll in that?" [...] Grohl added {{it was a way to}} [...] "do something really primal sounding", innovate, break people's expectations and [...] "make records the way <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> fucking make records".|$|E
