5|$|While on orbit, Challenger made {{a number}} of {{altitude}} and attitude adjustments, in order to test the behavior of a Shuttle orbiter and to perform some experiments in different thermal conditions. By exposing or shading areas from the sun in an unusual way, it was possible to induce particularly <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> cold conditions and observe any resulting problems.|$|E
5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that {{the system was}} indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

25|$|She had visible tan {{lines from}} a halter top or bikini, {{suggesting}} {{that she may}} have come from a region with abundant October–November sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s, and upstate New York is not generally <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> sunny enough for such tanning during that period.

25|$|As with 100% {{biodiesel}} (B100), {{to ensure}} the fuel injectors atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, vegetable oil fuel must be heated to reduce its viscosity to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> temperate climates. MAN B Diesel, Wärtsilä, and Deutz AG, {{as well as a}} number of smaller companies, such as Elsbett, offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.|$|E
25|$|Pizza strips are {{prepared}} in Italian bakeries {{and sold in}} most supermarkets and convenience stores. They are rectangular strips of pizza without cheese. Their rich flavor comes solely from a dense, zesty tomato paste baked on a half-inch (1.3cm) thick pan pizza crust, and may be enjoyed <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> cold. Party pizza is a box of these pizza strips. Spinach pies are similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned spinach instead of meat, sauce, and cheese. Variations can include black olives or pepperoni with the spinach.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} rosacea is unknown. Triggers that cause episodes of {{flushing}} and blushing {{play a part}} in its development. Exposure to temperature extremes, strenuous exercise, heat from sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, anxiety, cold wind, and moving to a <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> hot environment from a cold one, such as heated shops and offices during the winter, can each cause the face to become flushed. Certain foods and drinks can also trigger flushing, such as alcohol, foods and beverages containing caffeine (especially hot tea and coffee), foods high in histamines, and spicy foods.|$|E
25|$|Northern California has <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> mild to cold climate, {{in which}} the Sierra gets snow in the late fall through winter and {{occasionally}} into spring. Summers are warm and dry while winters are cool and usually wet. The high temperatures range from 50's to 30's in the winters while as summers temperatures range is 90's to 60's or 50's, with highs well into the 100s for the Sacramento region. Snow gets covered on the mountains in mid January through February. Fog occurs infrequently or occurs normally {{in the west and}} coast.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by moxibustion, the burning of cone-shaped preparations of moxa (made from dried mugwort) {{on or near the}} skin, often but not always near or on an acupuncture point. Traditionally, acupuncture was used to treat acute conditions while moxibustion was used for chronic diseases. Moxibustion could be direct (the cone was placed directly on the skin and allowed to burn the skin, producing a blister and eventually a scar), or indirect (either a cone of moxa was placed on a slice of garlic, ginger or other vegetable, or a cylinder of moxa was held above the skin, close enough to either <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> burn it).|$|E

25|$|Ocean {{currents}} greatly affect Earth's climate by transferring {{heat from}} the tropics to the polar regions. Transferring <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation. It {{plays an important role}} in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on Earth's energy budget. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The Iberian Peninsula, {{located on}} an {{important}} route between Africa and Europe, was enriched by the arrival, following the climate change, of wetland plants, thermophilic plants (those {{that require a}} great deal of heat), xerophilic plants (those that require a dry climate), orophilic (sub-alpine) plants, Boreo-alpine plants, and so on, many of which managed to remain, thanks to the diversity of environments that exist in the mountain ranges, and which allowed them to rise in altitude if the climate was too <b>warm,</b> <b>or</b> descend if it became too cold. The geological complexity of the majority of Iberian mountains, especially of the Cordillera Bética, Sistema Ibérico, and Pyrenees, also greatly increased the number of new environments to which it was possible to adapt, resulting in today's wide variety of flora.|$|E
25|$|The {{annual growth}} cycle of grapevines {{is the process}} {{that takes place in}} the {{vineyard}} each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital {{role in the development of}} grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (<b>warm</b> <b>or</b> cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.|$|E
