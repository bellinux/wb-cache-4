5|$|The al-Aqsa Mosque {{has seven}} aisles of {{hypostyle}} naves with several additional small halls {{to the west}} and east of the southern section of the building.

5|$|The {{chapter house}} has stained glass in its east window by Heaton, Butler and Bayne and {{grisaille}} <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{north and south}} walls, dated 1882–83, by Blomfield. It contains an oak cope cupboard from the late 13thcentury. The front of the chapter house was rebuilt to a design by Hussey.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the {{location}} of the window versus the whole of the image must be adjusted so that most of the image is seen beyond <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of viewing on a 3D TV set, it is easier to place <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> image, and to let <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane of the screen.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows are}} three- and four-light, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Perpendicular style, mostly {{dating from the}} 15th century. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north aisle is {{reticulated}} and <b>the</b> east <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapel to the south is curvilinear. The chancel has two-light casement windows.|$|R

5|$|The first {{automatic}} power {{windows were}} developed by Packard in 1940. Each of the major American brands experimented with the technology, which was initially for luxury vehicles {{as a replacement for}} manually operated roll up <b>windows.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, these became widespread in American passenger cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{window in}} the centre north wall has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by a mullion); there are two pairs of two-light <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south wall. The window at the east end {{had a pair of}} lights, topped by trefoils (a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles).|$|E
5|$|The <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th-century part are {{topped with}} trefoils (a {{stonework}} pattern of three overlapping circles) and set into square frames. The north wall has three windows, {{one with a}} single light (or section) and two with pairs of lights; there are two windows on the south wall (one with three lights, another with two) {{as well as a}} blocked window at the east end of the wall. The church's east window is a pointed arch with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top. The <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extension are set into pointed arches.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1860s Charles Edmund Clutterbuck, {{a master}} stained glass artist, made two windows for the parish church. They are <b>the</b> south <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vestry and <b>the</b> east <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north aisle. Between the years 1880-1887 Oakley church was re-dedicated from Saint Matthew to Saint Mary.|$|R

5|$|There {{is a pair}} of <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the window frame forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south wall of the nave; the stained glass of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E
5|$|Above {{the small}} family/chaplain's {{room on the}} third floor, was the servant's room with a corner {{fireplace}} and two windows on the mezzanine floor, accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east wall and a garderobe. There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

5|$|During the Second French Empire (1852–70) further {{changes were}} made, {{mainly to the}} interior. Hippolyte de La Rochefoucauld (1804–63), who had been {{minister}} plenipotentiary in Germany and Florence, brought a fine collection of furniture and 18th century Venetian glass chandeliers when he retired. He restored the great stone staircase. Influenced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc he decided to transform the large East tower into a library. He blocked up the old openings and pierced large new <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old walls.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge {{used his}} {{authority}} under the Antiquities Act {{to declare the}} statue a National Monument.

5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft wrote the operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft <b>Windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} redesign the buildings on the island, and six designs were submitted. One of the designs removed the existing buildings and piers to replace them with walking paths, and added a large curvilinear concrete building to the island. The design called for many <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused by the recession as their reason.|$|E
5|$|McLeansboro in {{particular}} experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its {{local high school}} reported 19broken <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The facade of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. Hamilton County Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one on the ceiling above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at one home, leading to further damage.|$|E

5|$|St Edern's Church, Bodedern (sometimes {{referred}} to as St Ederyn's Church) is a medieval parish church {{in the village of}} Bodedern, in Anglesey, north Wales. Although St Edern established a church in the area in the 6th century, the oldest parts of the present building date from the 14th century. Subsequent alterations include the addition of some <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th century, and a chancel, transept and porch in the 19th century, when the nave walls were largely rebuilt. Stained glass was also inserted into the windows of the chancel and transept.|$|E

5|$|The church {{features}} architecture by Edward Doran Webb {{and stained}} glass by Charles Eamer Kempe. The Forster Chapel, a lady chapel {{added to the}} south face in the 13th century, contains the alabaster effigial monument of Sir George Forster and his wife Elizabeth which was built in 1530. Evidence suggests that the chapel may originally have been a chantry dedicated to St Nicholas.
