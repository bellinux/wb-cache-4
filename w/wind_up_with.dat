25|$|The sixth {{game was}} played on 15 November 2014. Carlsen adopted the space-gaining Maróczy Bind setup against the Kan Variation of the Sicilian Defence, and {{accepted}} a set of isolated doubled pawns in return for active play. After an early queen exchange he soon developed a commanding position and appeared to have excellent winning chances. At move 26 there was a double blunder. Carlsen's 26.Kd2?? should have been answered with 26...Nxe5! (with a discovered attack on the g4-rook) 27.Rxg8 Nxc4+ (zwischenzug) 28.Kd3 Nb2+ 29.Ke2 Rxg8, and Black will <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> 2 extra pawns (on e5 and c4) and excellent winning chances. However, Anand missed this and played 26...a4?? Carlsen made no further mistakes and converted his advantage into a win.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Bruce Johnston {{explains}} that [...] "Brian really worked {{a lot on}} 'God Only Knows', and at one point, {{he had all the}} Beach Boys, Terry Melcher and two of the Rovell sisters [...] on it. It just got so overloaded; it was nuts. So he was smart enough to peel it all back, and he held voices back to the bridge, me at the top end, Carl in the middle and Brian on the bottom. At that point, Brian's right move was to get subtler. He had a very tender track here. 'God Only Knows' is a very small masterpiece with a major heartbeat, and he was right to peel everybody back and <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the three parts. In fact, it's probably the only well-known Beach Boys track that has just three voices on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giving {{the release}} a 3½ star rating, Matt Bjorke of Roughstock, saying [...] "All The Woman I Am had the {{potential}} to be a missed-opportunity after the first two tracks on the record but the album is saved by a meaty collection of songs that hopefully will find Reba retaining her current resurgence at radio". Allison Stewart with the Washington Post compared the album to its predecessor, Keep On Loving You, saying that the album [...] "tries harder, with worse results; McEntire and her collaborators aim for Carrie Underwood and too often <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> warmed-over Shania Twain". On a positive note, she called her version of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] "fantastic". Thom Jurek with Allmusic gave the release a 2½ rating, saying [...] "Everything, from songs and arrangements to production tries hard to sound on the contemporary edge, but comes off as underscoring that Underwood has the corner on this sound [...] ultimately, All the Women I Am falls flat; it feels awkward in its stylistic mimicry, and has no center".|$|E

She told the Guardian [...] "I walked into the newsroom {{and there was an}} eyewitness account making allegations [...] and analysis, if you can call it, from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, {{in a situation like that}} where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life." [...] She also noted that [...] "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" [...] and stated [...] "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it." [...] In follow-up interview she said [...] "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what you <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> on air is outright misinformation." [...] Calling RT [...] "mass information manipulation" [...] Firth said [...] "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove."

2500|$|Additionally, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kerry Condon, and Chris Evans reprise {{their roles}} as Pepper Potts, F.R.I.D.A.Y., and Steve Rogers / Captain America from {{previous}} MCU films, respectively. Rogers appears in public service announcements played at Parker's school. Jacob Batalon portrays Parker's best friend Ned, a [...] "complete gamer", whom Batalon described as [...] "the quintessential best guy, the best man, the number two guy, {{the guy in the}} chair" [...] for Parker. Marvel used Ned Leeds as a basis for the character, who does not have a last name in the script or film, but essentially created their own character with him. Carroll said that Ned and other characters in the film are composites of several of their favorites from Spider-Man comics, and while Ned may eventually <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the last name [...] "Leeds", it is not a guarantee. Laura Harrier portrays Liz, a senior, Parker's love interest, and Toomes' daughter, with a [...] "type-A" [...] personality. Tony Revolori plays Eugene [...] "Flash" [...] Thompson, Parker's rival and classmate. It was noted that the character is generally depicted as a white bully in the comics; the Guatemalan American actor received death threats upon his casting. Revolori worked hard [...] "to do him justice", as he is an important character to the fans. Rather than being a physically imposing jock, Thompson was re-imagined as [...] "a rich, smug kid" [...] to reflect modern views of bullying, by crafting him more into a social media bully and rival for Parker opposed to a jock; this depiction was largely informed by Holland's visit to The Bronx High School of Science. Revolori said that Thompson has to work hard to match Parker's intelligence, which is [...] "one of the reasons he doesn't like Peter. Everyone else seems to like Peter, so he's like, why don't they like me like they like him?" [...] Revolori gained [...] for the role.|$|E
