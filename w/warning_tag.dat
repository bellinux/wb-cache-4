500|$|In July 1996, {{the story}} of how Martin murdered Gerard Lowe, and the {{investigation}} that followed, was featured in an episode of the Singapore Crimewatch, which was shown on Television Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5 and Channel 8. In the episode, actual photographs from the autopsy were shown, causing the series to be the first current affairs programme in Singapore to be given the PG (Parental Guidance) <b>warning</b> <b>tag.</b> Police justified their use of the photographs, saying that they wanted to [...] "give an accurate account of the case to the public." [...] The story was also re-enacted in the last episode of MediaCorp TV's Channel 5 docu-drama True Files on 23 July 2002.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1984 the P-unit A-7D's {{deployed}} to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea {{to participate in}} Team Spirit 1984. The word was purposely leaked that the 4450th TG A-7Ds were carrying supersecret atomic antiradar devices that would render the airplane invisible. To maintain the deception, each A-7D was outfitted with old napalm canisters painted black with a flashing red danger light in the rear. The canisters carried a radiation <b>warning</b> <b>tag</b> over an ominous-looking slot on which was printed: [...] "Reactor Cooling Fill Port." [...] When the 4450th TG deployed carrying these bogus devices, Air Police closed down the base and ringed the field with machine gun-toting jeeps. They forced all the runway personnel to turn {{their backs to the}} A-7s as they taxied past, and actually had them spread-eagled on the deck with their eyes closed until the 4450th TG A7s took off.|$|E
40|$|When {{servicing}} battery, do {{not smoke}} or use flame in the vicinity. Batteries generate hydrogen, a highly explosive gas. Do not fill fuel tank while engine is running. Provide metallic {{contact between the}} fuel container and fuel tank to prevent a static spark from igniting fuel. Wipe or flush any spillage before starting the engine. Wear safety glasses and protective clothing when prescribed by the job. Do not remove the radiator cap from an overheated radiator;stop engine and allow radiator to cool. Make sure forks are lowered {{to the ground and}} hand brake is engaged firmly before leaving the truck unattended. If the truck is parked on an incline, set brakes and block at least two wheels. Store flammable liquids in safe containers. Disconnect battery cables before servicing electrical components. Use proper tools. Keep tools clean and in good condition. Install <b>warning</b> <b>tags</b> on the steering wheel if the vehicle is in unsafe operating condition or if any component has been drained...|$|R
5000|$|Estimates of {{how many}} {{citizens}} listened to Feindsender vary. According to Sicherheitsdienst reports, a large-scale campaign in 1941, charging Nazi Blockleiter to visit the households in their area and attach <b>warning</b> paper <b>tags</b> to receiving sets, met widespread discontent. Listening to foreign radio stations has been dubbed [...] "the little man's resistance" [...] because, together with friendliness to forced laborers (also a crime, and punished even more harshly), and taking detours to avoid passing a Nazi memorial where one {{would be forced to}} salute (the Viscardi Way or [...] "Shirkers' Way" [...] in Munich) it was very common and served as proof that somebody had not really been a Nazi, even though cowardice or good reasons hindered him from performing other actions of resistance.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will present an {{analysis}} of Yaqui moods and modes. Yaqui is an Uto-Aztecan language with approximately eighteen thousand speakers, most of whom live in Sonora, Mexico and Arizona. Yaqui, like all natural languages, has sentence mood. Yaqui is a verb -final language and has sentence-final suffixes marking tense /aspect and modality. Some of the terminology that I employ here is presented in Bach and Harnish (1979). The Yaqui taxonomy of communicative illocutionary acts contains Constatives, Directives, Commissives, and Acknowledgements. These illocutionary acts are carried out by employing a sentence with a particular mood /modal status. The terms "mood" and "mode" are frequently employed interchangeably, or with no clear definition {{of the difference between}} the two. My proposal here is that we may define sentence mood in Yaqui as a set of elements that define sentence type, that are necessary for sentencehood, and that are mutually exclusive. In contrast, sentence modes are optional features of sentences and are not mutually exclusive. Modes may occur with one another and necessarily occur with some mood. I will also distinguish between major and minor sentence moods; the minor moods may be recognized as sub-varieties of the major moods. An interesting result of this analysis is the identification of the semantic and pragmatic factors that constrain possible mood/mode combinations. I will now specify the Yaqui moods and modes. Moods: Every Yaqui sentence has one and only one mood. The three major moods in Yaqui are Declarative, Interrogative, and Imperative. Minor Moods: I identify four minor moods. The minor moods can be viewed as varieties or sub-classes of the major moods. The minor moods are <b>Warnings,</b> Prohibitions, <b>Tag</b> Questions, and Queclaratives. The first two are sub-varieties of the Imperative mood, and the latter two are sub-varieties of the Interrogative mood. These minor moods have pragmatic functions that differ from those of the corresponding major moods. Modes: Yaqui modes are either epistemic (relating to truth) or deontic (relating to action or control). The modes cooccur with the moods and with each other, as I will show. To begin, I will first describe the structure of each of the major moods...|$|R
