40|$|The {{advent of}} {{low-cost}} pressure transducers capable of directly measuring {{water surface elevation}} enables continuous measurements of dynamic <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes.</b> This opens up a new possibility of dynamically monitoring unsteady flows (i. e., hysteresis) {{during the course of}} flood wave propagation. Hysteresis in this context refers to a looped stage–discharge rating caused by unsteadiness of flows. Hysteresis is monitored in this study using a continuous slope area (CSA) method, which uses Manning's equation to calculate unsteady discharges based on continuously measured <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes.</b> In the rising stage, <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes</b> become steeper than a steady <b>water</b> surface <b>slope,</b> resulting in higher discharges than steady-based discharges, while the trends are reversed in the falling stage. The CSA method applied to Clear Creek near Oxford (Iowa, USA) estimates the maximum differences of peak discharges by 30 – 40  %, while it shows sound agreements for a low to medium range of discharges against USGS steady-based records. The primary cause of these differences is the use of a single channel bed slope in deriving Manning's roughness coefficients. The use of a single channel bed slope (conceptually equal to the <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes</b> at every stage in uniform flow conditions) causes substantial errors in estimating the channel roughness, specifically at high stages, because non-uniformities of natural channels result in varying (non-uniform) steady <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes</b> at each stage. While the CSA method is promising for dynamically tracking unsteady <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes</b> and flows in natural streams, more studies are still needed to increase the accuracy of the CSA method in future research...|$|R

Numerical schemes based on the total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin finite element method with slope limiter schemes based on <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> and <b>water</b> depth are used to solve one-dimensional shallow water equations. For each slope limiter, three different Riemann solvers based on HLL, LF, and Roe flux functions are used. The proposed <b>water</b> surface based <b>slope</b> limiter scheme is easy to implement and shows better conservation property compared to the slope limiter based on water depth.

40|$|AbstractThe {{confluence}} {{phenomenon is}} fairly {{common in the}} natural river. The research on the complicated and distinctive hydraulic behavior of confluence is of great practical and theoretic significance. The finite element model of Yangtze River and Jialing River is established based on two-dimensional depth-averaged surface-water flow and the hydraulic behavior at the confluence is investigated. The analysis shows that discharge ratio of mainstream to its confluent tributary is a crucial factor which dominates location of junction point, junction line and width of backflow zone near the lower reaches of confluence, the bigger is discharge ratio, the closer junction point is to shazui at Chaotianmen, the nearer junction line {{is on the side}} of Jialing River, and the smaller of width of backflow is. The <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> of the upper confluence depends on water level lifting up each other, when discharge ratio minish, the <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> of Yangtze River decreases, while the gradient of Jialing River increases. The <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> in the flow mixing region is direct proportional to Yangtze River's discharge and negative correlation to the discharge ratio...|$|R

40|$|Field {{observations}} of instantaneous <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes</b> in the swash zone are presented. For free-surface flows with a hydrostatic pressure distribution the surface slope {{is equivalent to}} the horizontal pressure gradient. Observations were made using a novel technique which in its simplest form consists of a horizontal stringline extending seaward from the beach face. Visual observation, still photography or video photography is then sufficient to determine the surface slope where the free-surface cuts the line or between reference points in the image. The method resolves the mean surface gradient over a cross-shore distance of 5 m or more to within +/- 0. 001, or 1 / 20 th - 1 / 100 th of typical beach gradients. In addition, at selected points and at any instant in time during the swash cycle, the <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> can be determined exactlv to be dipping either seaward or landward. Close to the location of bore collapse landward dipping <b>water</b> surface <b>slopes</b> of order 0. 05 - 0. 1 occur over a very small region (order 0. 5 m) at the blunt or convex leading edge of the swash. In the middle and upper swash the <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> at this leading edge is usually very close to horizontal or slightly seaward. Behind the leading edge, the <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> was observed to be very close to horizontal or dipping seaward at all times throughout the swash uprush. During the backwash the <b>water</b> surface <b>slope</b> was observed to be always dipping seaward, approaching the beach slope, and remained seaward until a new uprush edge or incident bore passed any particular cross-shore location of interest. The observations strongly Suggest that the swash boundary layer is subject to an adverse pressure gradient during uprush and a favourable pressure gradient during the backwash. Furthermore, assuming Euler 2 ̆ 7 s equations are a good approximation in the swash, the observations also show that the total fluid acceleration is negative (offshore) for almost the whole of the uprush and for the entire backwash. The observations are contrary to recent work suggesting significant shoreward directed accelerations and pressure gradients occur in the swash (i. e., delta u/delta t > 0 similar to delta p/delta x < 0), but consistent with analytical and numerical solutions for swash uprush and backwash. The results have important implications for sediment transport modelling in the swash zone. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
