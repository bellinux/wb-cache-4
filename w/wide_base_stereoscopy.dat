40|$|PURPOSES: The first {{generation}} of <b>wide</b> <b>base</b> tires introduced in the early 1980 s was found to cause {{a significant increase in}} pavement damage compared to dual-tire assemblies. However, <b>wide</b> <b>base</b> tires have evolved considerably, and a new generation of <b>wide</b> <b>base</b> tire is thought to be comparable to conventional dual tires for pavement damage. A challenge associated with using <b>wide</b> <b>base</b> tires is the accurate quantification of pavement damage induced by these tires. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the responses of flexible pavement to continuously moving vehicular loading under various tire configurations. METHODS: The comparison of the strain/stress responses of full-depth pavement caused by conventional dual tire assembly and new generation of wide-base tires was performed. The FE model incorporates linear viscoelasticity of asphalt material and continuous moving load using implicit dynamic analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The result demonstrates that the new wide-base tires caused slightly more fatigue damage and less primary rutting damage in HMA layer than a dual-tire assembly, but caused more secondary rutting damage in subgrade than a dual tire assembly...|$|R

5000|$|The statues found {{along the}} {{transport}} roads have <b>wider</b> <b>bases</b> than statues installed on ahu; this would facilitate more stable transport.

30|$|We {{developed}} {{a system with}} two consumer camcorders which allows the determination of three dimensional trajectories of barnacle cyprids <b>based</b> on <b>stereoscopy.</b> The hardware setup, {{as well as the}} technical issues for obtaining the 3 D swimming trajectories, are described in this article, including an empirical error analysis. We tested the system with cyprids of Semibalanus balanoides on chemically different surfaces (glass, PEG 2000 -OH and C 11 NMe 3 +Cl−) and first trajectories are visually presented. Several descriptive features are extracted from the trajectories in order to show the feasibility of the system in biological applications.|$|R

40|$|We present {{evidence}} for a new figure-ground cue: top-bottom polarity. In an explicit reporting task, participants {{were more likely to}} interpret stimuli with a <b>wide</b> <b>base</b> and a narrow top as a figure. A similar advantage for wide-based stimuli also occurred in a visual short-term memory task, where the stimuli had ambiguous figure-ground relations. Further support comes from a figural search task. Figural search is a discrimination task in which participants are set to search for a symmetric target in a display with ambiguous figure-ground organization. We show that figural search was easier when stimuli with a top-bottom polarity were placed in an orientation where they had a <b>wide</b> <b>base</b> and a narrow top, relative to when this orientation was inverted. This polarity effect was present when participants were set to use color to parse figure from ground, and it was magnified when the participants did not have any foreknowledge of the color of the symmetric target. Taken together the results suggest that top-bottom polarity influences figure-ground assignment, with <b>wide</b> <b>base</b> stimuli being preferred as a figure. In addition, the figural search task can serve as a useful procedure to examine figure-ground assignment...|$|R
