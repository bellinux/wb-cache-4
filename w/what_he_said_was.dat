He collected and published material in The Fredonian related to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> Burr's conspiracy to overthrow the US government.

25|$|Pope Shenouda III had {{arguments}} with then President Anwar Sadat over both the Camp David Accords and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> the president's deficient response to growing Islamism.

He wanted to dispute the evidence but trial Judge, Lord Sutherland, did not permit him to do so.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, Singh was {{appointed}} a goodwill ambassador for Fiji. He {{said that he}} did not expect anything in return from the Fijian government for representing his country. At a press conference on 18 May 2005, Singh commented on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a deterioration in race relations in Fiji, saying that for such a small country, people of all races should live together, put their differences aside, and get on with life.

25|$|A {{major issue}} {{at all levels}} was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's {{practice}} of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace. If it was the former, Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy for his pager messages. The city and department argued that Duke could not set or amend policy so <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> irrelevant. And even if it was, {{it did not matter}} since the pager messages could be disclosed under the California Public Records Act. The plaintiffs argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was all that mattered.|$|E

He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. The two likely knew each other at least by sight, as this building {{was the only one}} nearby with a restroom which Rowland had express permission to use, and the elevator operated by Page {{was the only one in}} the building. A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store located on the first floor of the Drexel, heard what sounded like a woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building. The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a distraught state. Thinking she had been assaulted, he summoned the authorities.|$|E

500|$|In 1924 J.
