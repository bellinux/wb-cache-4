30|$|The group variable, {{indicating}} dual versus solely school-based VET, had {{a significant}} though small effect on vocational identity (r[*]=[*]. 09). The effect of <b>workplace</b> identity on <b>workplace</b> effort was partially mediated by vocational identity (r[*]=[*]. 10). Although the direct effect of <b>workplace</b> identity on vocational identity was strong (. 49), its direct effect on <b>workplace</b> effort decreased and became quite small (r[*]=[*]. 08) when we allowed the mediation through vocational identity. The effect of free career choice on <b>workplace</b> effort was partially mediated by vocational identity and <b>workplace</b> identity (r[*]=[*]. 14); it also had a direct effect on <b>workplace</b> effort (r[*]=[*]. 16), <b>workplace</b> identity (r[*]=[*]. 38), and vocational identity (r[*]=[*]. 35). However, the effect of <b>workplace</b> integration on vocational identity was not significantly mediated by <b>workplace</b> identity (r[*]=[*]. 08).

This paper reports the findings on a cross sectional, descriptive, self-report, postal survey in 2007. A stratified random sample of 3, 000 of the 29, 789 members of the Queensland Nurses Union employed in the public, private and aged care sectors resulted in 1192 responses (39. 7 %). This paper reports the differences: between those nurses who experienced <b>workplace</b> violence and those who did not; across employment sectors. The incidence of <b>workplace</b> violence is highest in public sector nursing. Patients/clients/residents were the major perpetrators of <b>workplace</b> violence and the existence of a <b>workplace</b> policy did not decrease levels of <b>workplace</b> violence. Nurses providing clinical care in the private and aged care sectors experienced more <b>workplace</b> violence than more senior nurses. While <b>workplace</b> violence was associated with high work stress, teamwork and a supportive <b>workplace</b> mitigated <b>workplace</b> violence.

Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{categorize}} <b>workplace</b> aggression into nine subtypes based on human aggression and <b>workplace</b> aggression literature, and to examine gender differences in engaging in these subtypes of <b>workplace</b> aggression. Data collected from 366 employed students showed that a significant gender difference was found only in direct <b>workplace</b> aggression and there were no gender differences in the other eight <b>workplace</b> aggression subtypes; verbal, direct, and passive <b>workplace</b> aggression was more frequently used than physical, indirect and active <b>workplace</b> aggression, respectively.

40|$|<b>Workplace</b> {{bullying}} is {{a severe}} and pervasive {{problem in the}} United States and around the world. <b>Workplace</b> bullying affects millions of workers, leading to lost employment, psychological and physical illness, and injuries. The research on <b>workplace</b> bullying and the laws to protect targets of <b>workplace</b> bullying are both in their infancy. There {{is a lack of}} agreement on a definition of <b>workplace</b> bullying, and little research has been completed on remedial methods to address bullying. In the United States there is no real legal remedy for <b>workplace</b> bullying. The purpose of my research is to gain insight into targets' experiences with <b>workplace</b> bullying in order to better define <b>workplace</b> bullying, to gain an understanding of the outcomes of <b>workplace</b> bullying, to be able to begin to understand potential reasons for <b>workplace</b> bullying, {{and to be able to}} begin to develop model solutions to <b>workplace</b> bullying. This research suggests that the current definitions of <b>workplace</b> bullying are under-inclusive. Requirements of repetitiveness, intent, and a heightened level of severity often exclude many actual bullying acts from definitions of bullying. A broader, more inclusive, human-rights-based definition of <b>workplace</b> bullying is developed in this research. Further, this research demonstrates that the legal system in the US offers little protection to targets of <b>workplace</b> bullying. The focus of the US law on discrimination rather than dignity and judicial interpretations of the elements of <b>workplace</b> harassment eliminate the majority of bullying claims from any type of legal protection. Internationally, targets are afforded more protection, but there are still gaps in coverage. The insight gained into <b>workplace</b> bullying in this research is the first step to solving this problem of abuse in the <b>workplace.</b> Further research should be conducted to explore the reasons for bullying and for the lack of legal response to <b>workplace</b> bullying in the United States.

The Skill Builders <b>workplace</b> educator training program was 9 months long and offered 90 hours of instruction, including a 20 to 40 hour <b>workplace</b> field experience. Twenty-six people completed the prototype program. This investigative study posed two research questions: 1. What can we learn by identifying and evaluating the critical elements in a prototype <b>workplace</b> educator training program? 2. What can be gleaned through this investigation that can be utilized to design a <b>workplace</b> educator training program? <b>Workplace</b> educator is a new term emerging {{from the field of}} <b>workplace</b> literacy. A <b>workplace</b> educator facilitates basic learning involving language and computation, as well as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and decision-making. An examination of the pertinent literature identified five fields that impact on <b>workplace</b> education: <b>workplace</b> basics; training and development; <b>workplace</b> literacy and the contextual teaching approaches; current management theory with an emphasis on the high performance work organization; and <b>workplace</b> learning. The critical elements involved in the prototype program were identified through extensive inquiry using questionnaires, survey evaluation instruments, personal interviews, reports, journal review of the participants, and a focus group of Portland, Oregon, area employer representatives managing <b>workplace</b> education. The identified critical elements include an understanding of: (a) education in the workplace; (b) the characteristics of <b>workplace</b> educators; (c) <b>workplace</b> culture and organizational practices; (d) business/ education relationships; (e) the educational environment; (f) needs assessment/evaluation and assessment procedures; (g) <b>workplace</b> program design; (h) how to facilitate learning; (i) the development of communication skills for the <b>workplace</b> educator; (j) culture, class, and gender diversity in the workplace; and (k) appropriate uses of instructional technology. In addition, the data were examined through an evaluation research framework using the Stufflebeam (1983) CIPP (context, input, process, and products) model. The analysis showed that the program was highly satisfactory to the participants.
