5000|$|In {{the social}} <b>welfare</b> <b>area,</b> {{there are also}} {{perpetual}} disputes {{about the extent to}} which unemployment is voluntarily chosen by people, or involuntary, whether it is forced on people or whether it is their own choice. In the Great Depression of the 1930s, when unemployment rose to 20-30% of the working population in many countries, people generally believed it was involuntary. But if unemployment levels are relatively low, the argument that unemployment is a matter of choice is more often heard. It could be, that there simply are no jobs for the unemployed, but it could also be that there is a mismatch between the skills that the unemployed have, and the type of skilled labour for which there is a demand. If the latter is the case, then it could be argued that if the unemployed were willing to retrain or do a different kind of work, then they could get a job. In a sense, it is always possible to get a job, if a person is prepared to accept a low salary, but people might not want to work below a certain minimum amount of salary.|$|E

The students in this study were participants in the Pennsylvania Governor 's School for Agricultural Sciences (PGSAS). Within the five-week PGSAS program, students completed a two-week unit titled “Contemporary Issues in Animal Agriculture. " Three main issues were examined: animal welfare, resource use, and food safety as they relate to animal agriculture. The students ranked food safety as the primary concern with resource use second, and animal welfare third. Scholars with agricultural backgrounds rated specific issues as more beneficial to society than did scholars without agricultural backgrounds. Within the food safety area, both groups identified microbial contamination as the primary issue of concern. With regard to resource use, deforestation was ranked first, and in the animal <b>welfare</b> <b>area,</b> the pre-course issue of greatest concern was providing shelter.

40|$|Despite {{its clear}} {{potential}} and attractiveness {{as a solution}} to a broad range of societal problems, E-Government has not been adopted to levels predicted in early 2000 literature. Whilst case studies of punctual development of E-Government initiatives abound, few countries have progressed to high levels of maturity in the systematic use of ICT in the relationship between government and citizens. At the same time, the current period brings challenges in terms of access to public services and costs of delivering these services which make the large scale use of ICT by governments more attractive than ever, if not even a necessity.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop an {{assessment}} scheme for the evaluation at farm level of beef cattle welfare in the intensive rearing system {{that is capable of}} both identifying weak points in animal welfare and grading farms to such extent. The basic principle of the method was the avoidance of animal handling and the prolonged observation of cattle using animal-based and resource provision measures grouped in four classes of parameters: 1) Housing systems and facilities; 2) Health and cleanliness; 3) Animal behaviour and reactivity; 4) Quality of management and stockmanship. Each parameter was graded giving the highest scores to the best option for animal welfare, and the threshold value for distinguishing good from poor welfare conditions was set primarily on the results of scientific reports and investigations. An overall Welfare Index was calculated summing the scores of the 4 classes of parameters to formulate a general judgement of the farm and to allow comparison among them. The protocol was applied to 102 Italian intensive beef cattle farms rearing more than 300 young bulls/year. Regarding housing and facilities, the study showed that space allowance and space at the manger were the most frequent critical points. Within the "poor welfare" farms, more than 80 % provided less than 3. 5 m(2) /head to bulls weighing more than 500 kg, and none adopted a feeding frontage of at least 60 cm/head. Negatively judged farms compared to those ranked in the good <b>welfare</b> <b>area</b> for health and cleanliness showed a higher incidence of emergency slaughter (score 1. 7 : > 1 % vs score 3 : 0. 5 - 1 %, P< 0. 05) and lameness (score 1. 9 : 1. 5 - 3 % vs score 3. 3 : < 1. 5 %, P< 0. 05). Animal behaviour and reactivity parameters showed that in the "poor welfare" farms, bulls had a quicker flight reaction to the presence of both farmer and observer (P< 0. 01) likely due to a negative human-animal interaction. The quality of stockmanship was the category in which the highest number of farms failed to reach the acceptable threshold. Animal welfare was mainly impaired by the practice of tail docking and reduced feed availability. Although none of the farms included in the survey reached the maximum overall score, less then 30 % were graded in the poor <b>welfare</b> <b>area,</b> penalized mainly by low management quality. The protocol was shown to be effective in detecting specific critical points for animal welfare, even if further development should be addressed to testing repeatability at different fattening stages...|$|E
40|$|E-Government in {{its various}} forms and extensions, notably T-Government, is often {{presented}} as the panacea for resolving such complex social problems as social exclusion, lack of governance transparency, poor value for money and other ailments of modern societies. Yet, E-Government has not been adopted up to predicted levels.

This is especially true for those initiatives that involve socio-economic and cultural contexts, which makes their evaluation and the prediction of their impact difficult. This paper reports on an on-going E-Government initiative in Ireland aimed at implementing E-payments for G 2 C, notably in the social <b>welfare</b> <b>area.</b> Three sets of personal surveys have been carried out to understand the perceived impact of governmental plans of moving from an almost fully cash-based payment system to a fully electronic based solution.

40|$|Interest in {{the subject}} of {{privatisation}} in Australia has increased markedly over recent years, although references to it {{have been made in}} the literature intermittently over a longer period. The original purpose of this bibliography was to record items dealing with the privatisation of welfare services. However, as work on collecting material for the entries proceeded, it became obvious that it is extremely difficult to separate privatisation of welfare services from the effects on welfare of the privatisation of enterprises not directly concerned with those services. Privatisation of enterprises such as the water supply and communication services, has direct or indirect effects on the well-being of the population. It introduces the question of 'community service obligations' (CSOs), or the non-commercial objectives of government business organisations, which are often lost when these organisations are privatised. This bibliography has therefore widened its scope to include works which refer to the effects on the well-being of the population of the privatisation of enterprises not directly in the <b>welfare</b> <b>area.</b> Another issue which has affected the choice of entries has been that of what constitutes privatisation. A number of works cited here are concerned with definition and with detailing the nature of the changes which are entailed in different forms of privatisation: deregulation, the introduction of user-pays practices, asset sales etc. Among these may be included an expanded role for the voluntary or non-profit sector in the provision of community and welfare services.

40|$|Organizational {{culture and}} climate {{have been studied}} {{within the context of}} {{understanding}} the effectiveness of business and for-profit organizations. But these organizational factors have not been seriously considered in the social welfare literature, particularly in the child <b>welfare</b> <b>area,</b> even though Glisson and his colleagues have studied organizational culture and climate. This paper addresses this void through a systematic examination of organizational culture and climate and their effects on employee turnover in child welfare. To do this, it uses mainly the workforce retention study survey data that the New York State Social Work Education Consortium (SWEC) conducted and collected in 2002 and 2003. Organizational culture is classified into achievement/innovation/competence (AIC), cooperation/supportiveness/responsiveness (CSR), and emphasis on rewards (ER), while organizational climate into role clarity (RC), personal accomplishment (PA), emotional exhaustion (EE), and workloads (WL). It employs a logistic regression model (LRM) in analyzing an individual child welfare worker's intention to leave the current job. Empirical findings indicate that organizational culture and climate are the significant factors to explaining an employee's intention to leave. In particular, ER in organizational culture is significant, implying that child welfare employees with clearer and more effective incentives and rewards for job performance have less intention to leave than those with less clear and effective incentives and rewards. EE in organizational climate is significant, implying that employees with higher levels of emotional energy have less intention to leave than those with lower levels of energy. These findings suggest that child welfare organizations can improve organizational culture and climate by supporting ER and reducing EE.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{employees}} who develop work-related problems due to stress and other mental tensions has increased in Europe during the last decades, especially among women. One explanation of the female dominance is that women more often than men work in the service and health care sector. Consequently, they are more involved in human relations at work, involving more “emotion work” or “interaction work”. Emotion researchers have described low well-being and mental disorders related to work stress in terms of inauthenticity, as suppressing one’s true emotions. In this article, a social constructivist and contextual perspective on the self is adopted. Based on case studies at Swedish work settings, the article explores the connection between authenticity and values attached to {{the self and the}} impact of the organizational setting for their realization in interaction work. Work-related stress is examined {{in the light of the}} implementation of new public management rationales and directives in welfare organizations, with particular focus on customer-orientated management. The main conclusion is that, regardless of gender, stress and mental problems could be seen as effects of feelings of inauthenticity, caused by experiences of being prevented from realizing interpersonal self-values in personal encounters at work. Women more often work in the welfare sector and are consequently more often subjected to these moral dilemmas, enhanced by customer orientation. These premises form the background for the article’s understanding of women’s more frequent development of mental stress symptoms. The article contributes to the understanding of women’s stress-related problems at work as a phenomenon in the intersection point between the individual and the organization and to the revealing of the interpersonal consequences of the increased customer orientation in the <b>welfare</b> <b>area.</b> Furthermore, by examining the contextual and situational dimensions of authenticity at work, the article adds to the knowledge about being authentic in today’s world...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores alienated students' {{perceptions}} of the organizational health of a Year 7 to 10 A. C. T. high school. The study emerged at the theoretical level from a concern that school effectiveness studies focussed too narrowly on student academic attainment {{as an indicator of}} an effective school. A broader view of effectiveness would hopefully show {{that in the case of}} comprehensive co-educational government high schools, student alienation could have a powerful effect in undermining the achievement of academic goals in such schools. Because these schools have little control over their student clientele and require compulsory student attendance until age 15, it seemed a degree of alienation was inevitable. The task for high school administrators, it was hypothesized, lay in minimizing these alienation levels in order to reduce the impact such student alienation might have on other school effectiveness indicators like teacher commitment, teacher morale and time on task in classes. My experience as a practitioner, in the Student <b>Welfare</b> <b>area</b> of a large ACT government high school, also indicated that the traditional "top down" strategy of much research in the field of Educational Administration that concentrated on the perspectives of principals and teachers only gave one view of the processes within a school. The other, complementary "bottom up" view came from students. In particular, it was hypothesized, the perspectives the most alienated students in a government high school held towards the organizational health of the school might represent an unusual test of school effectiveness. This was because the commitment of such students towards the school and its stated academic goals was most problematic. The promotion of a school "culture" or "ethos" that could integrate low level and high level alienation students, and thereby foster school effectiveness, appeared to be possible only to the extent that high level alienation students could be kept on side or neutralized by high school administrators. These speculations were largely confirmed in this study. Apart from the interaction of sex and year level with alienation, the other major finding was that teacher consideration, or the extent to which teachers show concern for students as individuals, was the only organizational health dimension that produced a significant difference between students on the basis of alienation level. In short, the study is not concerned with student alienation as such. Rather it is concerned with understanding how alienated students perceive a relatively effective school. This would hopefully enable that alienation to be minimized and managed...|$|E

The main indicators were total time spent by cows in the robot {{and information about}} the movement of cows after leaving the milking box. The {{next step was to}} evaluate a time needed to prepare a dairy cow from entrance into the robot to a successful use of teat handpiece. Of course it was necessary to evaluate effects of stress on selected blood parameters. We can {{give us an idea of}} welfare using this loosely housing based on these observation. Next reason is the posibility of free decision in which intervals during the day the cows will be milked. Measured and monitored values were collected by observing dairy cows and precise records of their activities from entrance into the robot. In thirty minutes after leaving the robot it was recorded the movement of animals in housing and then satisfying their physiological needs, rating, drinking and lying down. The measurment was realized in standard operating conditions for 24 hours. The measurment was realized by all milked cows in the herd. Time information of ongoing operations and daily milk production were taken from the milking robot Lely Astronaut. Results of these measurements were evaluated by Microsoft Excel, Statistica 9 and then compared with total performance. Information of stress in all ways of milking were getting from the experimental work of VFU Brno. The observations didn´t show any serious problems in <b>welfare</b> <b>area.</b> Animals were calm and satisfied all the time of evaluating. Milking was carried out without any problems and dairy cows entered discipline into the box of robot. Only five cows (6 % of milked cows) had to be chasing with the help of zootechnician.

The {{aim of the}} thesis is instead to present how the conception of the professional work is created through the language idiom. In order to attain the aim of the thesis, I have analysed texts that, in the period 1992 - 2012, primarily have been found in the periodical Norges Barnevern (Child Welfare in Norway). However, I have also analysed central policy documents, such as for example Reports to the Storting and Norwegian official reports. The thesis has a qualitative design. The research issues focus on the following aspects: Which participants' voices are heard? How do various participants make their voices heard? Which professional conceptions are behind what is said? The results show that there are various professions that claim to have a right to point out the direction as to how competence relative to child welfare may be understood. In other words, it is not reserved for professions with a professional background in social work. With the aid of legal claimsmaking, lawyers are constructed as guarantors of legal protection, and as useful to society. The competence that is referred to is the one that may be governed through rules of law. In addition, the findings show that psychologists make several attempts at creating a role as carriers of knowledge within child welfare. With an emphasis on evidence based knowledge and affiliated research, we see tendencies towards psychologicalization of the work related to child welfare. We also see tendencies to professional antagonism between child welfare officers and social workers, where both professions are made into spokesmen for their own professional territory. The competence which is claimed to strengthen the child welfare's professional legitimacy is mainly connected to evidence based explanatory models. The evidence discourse claims the requirement to reduce the use of professional discretion, and implicitly in these discussions, there are thoughts to the effect that the work related to child welfare is not as complex that it may not, to a certain extent, be standardized. The competence which is attributed value is also linked to requirements for cost efficiency. In this context, the findings indicate that lawyers and psychologists, {{to a greater extent than}} social workers and child welfare officers, fit in, or have adapted to the new administrative models, and to the requirement that complicated assessments within the professional practice, should be replaced by efficiency and evidence based package deals...|$|E
