5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In Ship Harbour {{citizens}} <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> for 5 {{days until}} a temporary road was made. Also in Spaniard's Bay, the flooding caused {{a bridge to}} depress about 1.5feet (50cm); a temporary bridge was built within two months, with a permanent replacement scheduled to be finished {{by the summer of}} 2008. Insured damage across the area totaled $25million (2007CAD, $24.3million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} nearly 200 {{years before the}} active principles, quinine and other alkaloids, of cinchona bark <b>were</b> <b>isolated.</b> Quinine, a toxic plant alkaloid, is, in {{addition}} to its anti-malarial properties, an effective muscle relaxant, as the modern use for nocturnal leg cramps suggests (corroborating its use for shivering by the Peruvian Indians).|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma hominis <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> {{from the}} upper urinary tract in 7 of 80 {{patients}} with acute pyelonephritis and from 0 of 60 patients with noninfectious diseases of the urinary tract, a significant difference. In four cases M. hominis <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> in pure culture, in one it <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> together with Ureaplasma urealyticum, and in two it <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> with bacteria. U. urealyticum <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> {{from the upper}} urinary tract of five patients, all with acute pyelonephritis; this was {{not significantly different from}} the control group...|$|R

5|$|Protease {{inhibitory}} {{activity in}} blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, {{but it was not}} until the 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin <b>were</b> <b>isolated.</b> Initial research focused on their role in human disease: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common genetic disorders, causing emphysema, and antithrombin deficiency results in thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Psychoda albipennis, Psychoda lobata and Tinearia alternata <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> {{from the}} fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus. The larvae of Psychoda lobata are known to develop {{from a wide range}} of fungus species from over 30 genera.|$|E
5|$|The major {{components}} of the Mk 38 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) were the Director, Plotting Room, and interconnecting data transmission equipment. Two systems, forward and aft, were each complete and independent. Their plotting rooms <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> to protect against battle damage propagating {{from one to the}} other.|$|E

5|$|Using the {{wilderness}} of the pampas to reinforce his social analysis, he characterizes those who <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> and opposed to political dialogue as ignorant and anarchicsymbolized by Argentina's desolate physical geography. Conversely, Latin America {{was connected to}} barbarism, which Sarmiento used mainly to illustrate {{the way in which}} Argentina was disconnected from the numerous resources surrounding it, limiting the growth of the country.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.|$|E
5|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some {{of the success of the}} evacuation measures. Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome as a symbol of the flooding occurring in New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|Emily's second {{landfall}} as {{a strong}} Category3 hurricane brought significant damage to the northeast coast of Mexico. In the fishing community of Laguna Madre, over 80% of the buildings were destroyed {{as a result of}} the storm surge. Several communities on the remote coast of Tamaulipas <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> after the storm, and major coastal flooding was reported along with heavy wind damage, with numerous homes destroyed. Inland flooding was also reported in Monterrey.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{that preceded}} the storm forced {{thousands}} of gamblers along the Las Vegas Strip to be evacuated and left two people missing. The remnants of the storm later moved into the region, bringing additional flooding. Many parking lots in the resort town of Laughlin were flooded. Furthermore, the villages of Searchlight and Blue Diamond <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> due to flooding. Several major streets in Paradise were closed because of flooding and sandbag barriers were erected alongside Caesars Palace to prevent further flood damage. In addition, record river levels were measured along the Amargosa River near Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> from tobacco which {{activated}} {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E

5|$|In northwestern Madagascar, Josie dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and caused widespread flooding. Several towns <b>were</b> <b>isolated,</b> forcing residents to travel by boat. The storm heavily damaged crops in the region, particularly to vanilla. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding up to 3.6m (12ft) deep. Nationwide, at least 36people were killed due to Josie, {{although there were}} initial reports of 500people missing. On Europa Island, Josie produced maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (81mph), with gusts to , before blowing the anemometer away.|$|E
5|$|In the {{municipality}} of Atlamajalcingo, a woman died after {{a collapse of}} a dwelling. In Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero, four people perished. Numerous trees were downed and power outages were reported. Additionally, the nearby Cerrito Rico dam nearly overflowed its banks. In the Tecpan municipality, four rivers overflowed their banks and six people died because of landslides. Many mountainous communities <b>were</b> <b>isolated,</b> thus making in difficult to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|Mysids have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution and {{are found in}} both marine and freshwater environments, the deep sea, estuaries, shallow coastal waters, lakes, rivers and underground waters. They are primarily marine and fewer than ten percent are found in freshwater. There are about 72 freshwater species in total, being predominantly found in the palearctic and neoptropical zones. These non-marine mysids occur in four distinct types of habitats; some are estuarine species; some <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> in the Ponto-Caspian Basin where Paramysis has since radiated enormously (23 species); some are glacial relicts and some are subterranean Tethyan relicts.|$|E
40|$|In this study, it <b>was</b> {{aimed to}} <b>isolate</b> some {{pathogens}} from raw milk of different milch animals. For this aim, 36 samples of sheep milk, 25 samples of goat milk and 4 samples of cow milk were analyzed. Among the 66 total raw milk samples, S. aureus <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from 12 samples while E. coli <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from 6 samples.

5|$|Only 13days after Eline {{struck the}} country, Cyclone Gloria also hit northeastern Madagascar, {{bringing}} additional damage and flooding. The two storms collectively {{killed at least}} 140people, although there was initial uncertainty in the toll due to disrupted communications. Floods from the two storm inundated 70% of homes and wrecked 70% of the crops in the districts of Andapa, Sambava, Antalaha, and Vohemar. About 12,000people in 114villages <b>were</b> <b>isolated.</b> Rice fields were flooded for over a week, and coffee and banana crops had severe losses. Collectively, 12,230people were left without access to clean water.|$|E
5|$|Spores of S.thiersii {{are white}} and roughly spherical. They measure {{approximately}} 7.8 – 9.8 by 7.3 – 9.0µm and are amyloid. In an analysis, both monokaryotic (one nucleus per cell) and dikaryotic (two nuclei per cell) strains <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> from fruit bodies. All the spores {{were found to}} be binucleate but the researchers believed that in the monokaryotic strain, the second nucleus had failed to pass through the germ tube.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a blow for the French {{defenders}} of Martinique, who <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> from France and suffering from shortages {{of military and}} food supplies. Although another supply frigate broke through the blockade and arrived in December 1808, the island was surrounded by British bases and was invaded and captured in January 1809. Other French colonies were seized {{over the next two}} years as the blockade cut off French communications with their overseas territories. Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active in this campaign, capturing a second French frigate, Niémen, at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E
