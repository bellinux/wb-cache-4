500|$|Marcus Söderlund {{directed}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Silvia". It premiered exclusively on NME website in December 2009. A writer for Complex commented, [...] "The vid {{is kind of}} dramatic and hard to make sense of, but <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> from a band like this?" [...] The video plays out in a post-apocalyptic world. It begins with the band's three members waking up from sleeping {{in the middle of}} a street, appearing to be homeless. The men then walk way in the woods while shots of homeless people are interspersed. Several people are seen carrying torches in the woods and are soon joined by the band. They then set fire to a large wooden version of a jackalope and the video ends as it bursts into flames.|$|E

She also performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the headliner of the Jingle Ball on December 8, 2003, at Staples Center.

After an introduction in which she briefly appeared on a large video screen, Spears took the stage standing on top of a hotel bus, wearing a tight black catsuit. She was surrounded by dancers dressed as employees and columns of LED lighting, suggesting the façade of a glitzy hotel on the Vegas Strip. MTV UK commented, [...] "OK, so she doesn't so much sing than mime along with Toxic, [...] But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> when she's simultaneously performing a vigorous dance routine, ascending moving staircases and descending fireman poles?".|$|E

6000|$|... "It is no use {{addressing}} your absent aunt--if {{you have}} got one. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> if <b>you</b> would insist on coming to a hell like this?" [...] I asked gloomily.|$|R

6000|$|Butler {{looked at}} the huge stacks of wheat, which filled the yard, over which the {{chickens}} were fluttering and crawling, catching grasshoppers, and out of which the crickets were singing innumerably.

6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} general relentlessly, [...] "that {{you have never}} {{attempted}} any defence. That has been to your credit with me.

"Mr. Bullfrog," [...] said she, not unkindly, {{yet with}} all the {{decision}} of her strong character, [...] "let me advise you to overcome this foolish weakness, and prove yourself, {{to the best of}} your ability, as good a husband as I will be a wife.
