40|$|Due {{to recent}} SARS related issues (Science 300 (5624) 1394; Nature 423 (2003) 240; Science 300 (5627) 1966), the {{development}} of reliable airborne virus monitoring procedures has become galvanized by an exceptional sense of urgency and is presently in a high demand (In: Cox, C. S., <b>Wathers,</b> C. M. (Eds.), Bioaerosols Handbook, Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, FL, 1995, pp. 247 - 267). Based on engineering control method (Aerosol Science and Technology 31 (1999) 249; 35 (2001) 852), which was previously applied to the removal of particles from gas carriers, a new personal bioaerosol sampler has been developed. Contaminated air is bubbled through porous medium submerged into liquid and subsequently split into multitude of very small bubbles. The particulates are scavenged by these bubbles, and, thus, effectively removed. The current study explores its feasibility for monitoring of viable airborne SARS virus. It {{was found that the}} natural decay of such virus in the collection fluid was around 0. 75 and 1. 76 lg during 2 and 4 h of continuous operation, respectively. Theoretical microbial recovery rates of higher than 55 and 19 % were calculated for 1 and 2 h of operation, respectively. Thus, the new sampling method of direct non-violent collection of viable airborne SARS virus into the appropriate liquid environment was found suitable for monitoring of such stress sensitive virus.

40|$|O enfoque {{principal}} desta pesquisa é a utilização de águas residuárias tratadas da ETE-Samambaia para criação de peixes. Objetivou-se avaliar se a qualidade do efluente da estação é apropriada para a criação da espécie tilápia do Nilo (Oreochromis niloticus) e, em caso negativo, que soluções podem ser dadas para a situação. O trabalho foi desenvolvido em três tanques piscicolas: o primeiro recebeu efluente da estação e alevinos, sem alimentação complementar (denominado TA); o segundo tanque recebeu apenas efluente, (chamado TB); e o terceiro tanque recebeu água natural e alevinos, que foram alimentados com ração artificial, (nomeado TC). As análises de água realizada foram: DQO; ST; SST; SDT; NTK; NH 4 -N; NO 3 -N; PO 4 -P; DBO; medidas de transparência com Disco de Secchi; pH; temperatura; OD e condutividade; Coliformes Totais e Termotolerantes e Clorofila-a. Pretendia-se avaliar a qualidade sanitária dos peixes, bem como presença de Salmonella sp, Coliformes Fecais, Mesófilas e Clostridium sulfito redutores. Devido a problemas observados no decorrer do experimento e não previstos no plano original, tornou-se necessário fazer algumas adaptações na metodologia original. A primeira delas foi a utilização de tanques-rede nos dois tanques que receberam alevinos, até que os peixes atingissem cerca de 25 g. A segunda providência foi a inserção da fase de aclimatação, que consistia em estocar alevinos em reservatórios de água para verificar a aceitabilidade do lote (fase 1) e depois adaptar os alevinos às condições adversas às quais eles seriam expostos (fase 2). Na fase 1, os alevinos foram considerados aptos para o cultivo. Na fase 2, não se percebeu a mortandade de peixes, apesar da condição a qual eles foram expostos ter sido considerada inadequada para a criação da espécie. Contudo, a qualidade da água na fase 2 era melhor que as condições do tanque TA. Observou-se, ao final do experimento, a mortandade total dos alevinos estocados. Um dos motivos que pode ter causado esse fato foram os altos teores de amônia e as baixas concentrações de oxigênio dissolvido. O valor médio de amônia no tanque TA, durante o experimento 2 foi de 22 mg. L- 1 e a concentração média de OD, 2, 4 mg. L- 1. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis principal {{focus of}} this research is the utilization of residuaries <b>wathers</b> treated on ETE Samambaia for fish cultivation. Its objective was to evaluate if the effluent quality from the station is appropriate for the creation of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and, if the results are negative, which solutions could be given to the situation. The work was developed in three cultivation tanks: the first one was received effluent form de station and young fish fed with the Plant effluent and received young fish without any complementary food (TA tank); the second one received only treated effluent (TB tank); and the third tank received natural water and young fish, which was given artificial ration (TC tank). The water’s analysis performed were COD, Total Solids, Suspended Solids, Dissolved Total Solids, TKN, Ammonia Nitrogen, Nitrate Nitrogen, Orthophosphate, BOD, Secchi Disk transparency, pH, temperature, DO, conductivity, total coliform, termotolerant coliform, and chlorophyll-a. The intention was also to evaluate the fish sanitary quality through the presence of Salmonella sp, faecal coliform, mesophile and Clostridiun sulfide reductors bactéria. Due to unpredictable problems observed during the planned experiment, it was necessary to make some adaptations to the original proposed methodology. The first one was the utilization of tanks-net inside the two thanks that recived young fish until the fish grew up 25 g. The second was inserted into the original methodology, procedure consisting of stocking young fish in separated water tanks to verify the fish suitability (phase 1) and than adapt the young fish to the adverse conditions they should be exposed (phase 2). During the phase 1, the young fish were considered able to be cultivated. During the phase 2, there was no mortality of the fishes despite the water quality for fish cultivation was considerated inapropriated. However, the water quality in the phase 2 was better than the TA tank. At the end of the experiment, it was observed the number of the stocked of dead fish. One of the reasons caused the mortality was provocate by the high ammonia contents and the low dissolved oxygen concentrations present in the cultivation tanks’ water. The average ammonia concentration in the TA tank during the experiment 2 was 22 mg. L- 1 and the average DO was 2, 4 mg. L- 1...|$|R
