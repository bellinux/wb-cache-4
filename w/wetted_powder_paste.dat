40|$|Superplasticiser (SP) is an {{indispensable}} {{ingredient in the}} production of contemporary concrete, which is designed to satisfy multi-concurrent performance criteria such as strength, flowability, passing ability, segregation and dimensional stability. Use of SP can decrease flocculation of fine powder and enhance the workability of concrete. However, {{at the same time it}} increases the shear thickening of concrete resulting in reduced pumping distance, less uniform mixing and more difficult on-site manual handling, e. g. shovelling or surface trowelling. Therefore, the SP dosage for concrete mix design should be limited, or more practically, fillers should be added to reduce the shear thickening. This paper proposes to decrease the shear thickening of cement <b>powder</b> <b>paste</b> by replacing part of the cement with an equal volume of filler. From the test results, it was evident that when fly ash, silica fume or limestone is added to replace cement, the shear thickening decreases significantly. Also, it was found that the shear thickening of cement <b>powder</b> <b>paste</b> can be correlated negatively to the wet packing density. As the wet packing density increases, the tendency of having clustering of particles or free polymer chains from the SP decreases and thus shear thickening...|$|R

The effect of partially <b>wetted</b> <b>powder</b> re-entering the spray zone is not currently known. To investigate, droplets were added to a powder bed at controlled separation distances and time intervals.

George and Harold get revenge on Mr. Krupp and the other teachers by re-routing the water system, planting <b>powdered</b> <b>paste</b> on the ceiling fan, and placing Styrofoam in the refrigerator. After the field trip ends, Mr. Krupp and the teachers enter the lounge.

Nobody seemed to notice, and Ms. Ribble (George & Harold's teacher) goes to the sink for a drink of water. The faucet malfunctions and sprays her and the other teachers. The ceiling fan spins faster, and the paste lands and sticks to the teachers. The teachers quickly assume that George and Harold were behind this prank. Ms. Ribble opens the refrigerator and the Styrofoam flies around the room thanks to the ceiling fan, making the situation even worse.

40|$|Granulation of poorly <b>wetting</b> <b>powders</b> is {{a common}} problem in the pharmaceutical, {{minerals}} and fertilizer industries. It is usually assumed that good wetting {{is a prerequisite for}} good nucleation. Although this is generally true, robust granulations with poor <b>wetting</b> <b>powders</b> are possible. Recent investigation confirmed that nucleation can occur by spreading of hydrophobic sub-micron particles around the droplet, termed &# 039;solid spreading nucleation&# 039;. Moreover, nuclei formed consist of a consolidated powder shell and an empty core, and have extremely high porosity with adequate strength. In this study, single drop solid-spreading nucleation experiments were performed, where single drops of water and glycerin were produced using a microlitre syringe and placed onto loosely packed powder beds. Several powders including salicylic acid, 2 -Ethoxybenzamide and three size grades of hydrophobic glass ballotini were used. Nucleus formation was observed via high speed video camera and a microscope. Preliminary experiments suggest that some bulk fluid motion is required for shell formation to occur, and that smaller particle size, lower fluid viscosity and higher kinetic energy during impact all favor the formation of a powder shell. Based on experimental results and observations, solid spreading nucleation mechanism and a model for surviving liquid marble was suggeste...|$|R
