2500|$|A {{factor is}} {{the manner in which}} the spouse died. [...] The {{survivor}} of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence. [...] The grief, in all events, however, can always be of the most profound sort to the widow and the widower. [...] Emotional unsteadiness, bouts of crying, helplessness and hopelessness are just a small sample of what a <b>widow</b> <b>or</b> <b>widower</b> can expect to face. [...] Depression and loneliness are very common. [...] Feeling bitter and resentful are normal feelings for the spouse who is [...] "left behind". [...] Oftentimes, the widow/widower may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{customary}} for Americans {{to hold a}} wake in {{a funeral}} home within a couple days {{of the death of}} a loved one. [...] The body of the deceased may be embalmed and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open-casket viewing. [...] Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming. [...] Friends, relatives and acquaintances gather, often from distant parts of the country, to [...] "pay their last respects" [...] to the deceased. [...] Flowers are brought to the coffin and sometimes eulogies, elegies, personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited. [...] Otherwise, the attendees sit, stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer. [...] Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans and others.

60|$|Suppose, now, we {{made the}} {{willingness}} of a parent {{to give up his}} or her children the measure of his beneficialness to them. There is no reason why we should restrict divorce only to the relation of husband and wife. Let us broaden the word and make it conceivable for a husband or wife to divorce not only the partner, but the children. Then {{it might be possible to}} meet the demands of the Shaw-esque extremist up to the point of permitting a married parent, who desired freedom, to petition for a divorce, not from his or her partner simply, but from his or her family, and even for a <b>widow</b> <b>or</b> <b>widower</b> to divorce a family. Then would come the task of the assessors. They would make arrangements for the dissolution of the relationship, erring from justice rather in the direction of liberality towards the divorced group, they would determine contributions, exact securities appoint trustees and guardians.... On the whole, I do not see why such a system should not work very well. It would break up many loveless homes, quarrelling and bickering homes, and give a safety-valve for that hate which is the sinister shadow of love. I do not think it would separate one child from one parent who was really worthy of its possession.|$|E

6000|$|White of Selborne, {{who gives}} {{the case of}} the owl, adds that he knew a man, who from believing that {{partridges}} when paired were disturbed by the males fighting, used to shoot them; and though he had widowed the same female several times she was always soon provided with a fresh partner. This same naturalist ordered the sparrows, which deprived the house-martins of their nests, to be shot: but the one which was left, “be it cock or hen, presently procured a mate, and so for several times following.” I could add analogous cases relating to the chaffinch, nightingale, and redstart. With respect to the latter bird (Phœnicura ruticilla), the writer remarks that it was by no means common in the neighbourhood, and he expresses much surprise how the sitting female could so soon give effectual notice that she was a widow. Mr. Jenner Weir has mentioned to me a nearly similar case: at Blackheath he never sees or hears the note of the wild bullfinch, yet when one of his caged males has died, a wild one {{in the course of a}} few days has generally come and perched near the widowed female, whose call-note is far from loud. I will give only one other fact, on the authority of this same observer; one of a pair of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) was shot in the morning; by noon a new mate was found; this was again shot, but before night the pair was complete; so that the disconsolate <b>widow</b> <b>or</b> <b>widower</b> was thrice consoled during the same day. Mr. Engleheart also informs me that he used during several years to shoot one of a pair of starlings which built in a hole in a house at Blackheath; but the loss was always immediately repaired. During one season he kept an account and found that he had shot thirty-five birds from the same nest; these consisted of both males and females, but in what proportion he could not say: nevertheless after all this destruction, a brood was reared.[153] ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{great number}} of people object to divorce under any {{circumstances}} whatever. This {{is the case with}} the orthodox Catholic and with the orthodox Positivist. And many religious and orthodox people carry their assertion of the indissolubility of marriage to the grave; they demand that the <b>widow</b> <b>or</b> <b>widower</b> shall remain unmarried, faithful to the vows made at the altar until death comes to the release of the lonely survivor also. Re-marriage is regarded by such people as a posthumous bigamy. There is certainly a very strong and logical case to be made out for a marriage bond that is indissoluble even by death. It banishes step-parents from the world. It confers a dignity of tragic inevitability upon the association of husband and wife, and makes a love approach the gravest, most momentous thing in life. It banishes for ever any dream of escape from the presence and service of either party, or of any separation from the children of the union. It affords no alternative to [...] "making the best of it" [...] for either husband or wife; they have taken a step as irrevocable as suicide. And some logical minds would even go further, and have no law as between the members of a family, no rights, no private property within that limit. The family would be the social unit and the father its public representative, and though the law might intervene if he murdered or ill-used wife or children, or they him, it would do so in just the same spirit that it might prevent him from self-mutilation or attempted suicide, {{for the good of the}} State simply, and not to defend any supposed independence of the injured member. There is much, I assert, to be said for such a complete shutting up of the family from the interference of the law, and not the least among these reasons is the entire harmony of such a view with the passionate instincts of the natural man and woman in these matters. All unsophisticated human beings appear disposed to a fierce proprietorship in their children and their sexual partners, and in no respect is the ordinary mortal so easily induced to vehemence and violence.|$|E
