[...] Stating that he [...] "was inspired by blues rock rather than metal," [...] Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a [...] "melodic player." [...] Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he claims is in contrast to Smith's [...] "rhythmic" [...] sound.|$|E

The first was a cover of Rainy Davis' [...] "Sweetheart" [...] (1987) performed as a duet with co-producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. Dupri had worked with Carey in the past, contributing to her album Daydream, and co-produced several hip-hop remixes of her songs. Carey said of the inspiration for its recording, [...] "I was thinking of the old songs I used to listen to when I was in school. It's a really cute record. Young girls'll like it the way I liked it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up." [...] Another new song featured on #1's was [...] "When You Believe", which Carey said was included because she felt it was [...] "a miracle" [...] that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song [...] "When You Believe" [...] for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt.

500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana...

I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards.

Charlotte Tudor, of the film's distributor, Buena Vista, said: [...] "Chicago has the same feel as north London, there is a vibrant music scene, a lot of the action is set in smoky bars and, of course, there is the climate.

2500|$|After Stokowski's death, Tom Burnam writes, the [...] "concatenization of canards" [...] {{that had}} arisen around him was revived {{that his name}} and accent were phony; that his musical {{education}} was deficient; that his musicians did not respect him; that he cared about nobody but himself. Burnam suggests {{that there was a}} dark, hidden reason for these rumours. Stokowski deplored the segregation of symphony orchestras in which women and minorities were excluded, and, so Burnam claims, his detractors got revenge by slandering Stokowski. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding the claims made by Tom Burnam, attitudes towards Stokowski have changed dramatically over the years since his death. In 1999, for Gramophone magazine, the noted music commentator David Mellor wrote: [...] "One of the great joys of recent years for me has been the reassessment of Leopold Stokowski. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up there was a tendency to disparage the old man as a charlatan. Today it is all very different. Stokowski is now recognised as the father of modern orchestral standards. He possessed a truly magical gift of extracting a burnished sound from both great and second-rank ensembles. He also loved the process of recording and his gramophone career was a constant quest for better recorded sound. But the greatest pleasure of all for me is his acceptance now as an outstanding conductor of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music, including a lot that was {{at the cutting edge of}} contemporary achievement." ...|$|E
