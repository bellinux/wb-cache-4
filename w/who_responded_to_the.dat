Doctors said that West knew the extent of her injuries and even visited with Kenny Rogers shortly before her last operation.

After her relatives had called 9-1-1, Riverside Police Department officers <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene observed {{a gun in the}} young woman's lap, and according to their accounts, she was shaking and foaming at the mouth, and in need of medical attention. When officers decided to break her window to reach her, as one officer reached for the weapon, she allegedly awoke and clutched her firearm, prompting several officers to open fire, hitting her 23 times and killing her. When the Riverside County district attorney stated that the officers involved had erred in judgement but committed no crime, declining to file criminal charges against them, Sharpton participated in protests which reached their zenith when protestors spilled onto the busy SR 91, completely stopping traffic. Sharpton was arrested for his participation and leadership in these protests.|$|E

500|$|After 1945, {{stories of}} the Lalaurie slaves became {{considerably}} more explicit. Jeanne deLavigne, writing in Ghost Stories of Old New Orleans (1946), alleged that Lalaurie had a [...] "sadistic appetite [...] seemed never appeased until she had inflicted on {{one or more of}} her black servitors some hideous form of torture" [...] and claimed that those <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1834 fire had found [...] "male slaves, stark naked, chained to the wall, their eyes gouged out, their fingernails pulled off by the roots; others had their joints skinned and festering, great holes in their buttocks where the flesh had been sliced away, their ears hanging by shreds, their lips sewn together... Intestines were pulled out and knotted around naked waists. There were holes in skulls, where a rough stick had been inserted to stir the brains."

500|$|As Thomas Asbridge wrote, [...] "Just {{as we can}} {{do nothing}} more than {{estimate}} the number of thousands <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent." [...] Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, {{hoping to find a}} better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, [...] "This image is ... profoundly misleading." [...] He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land. It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.|$|E
