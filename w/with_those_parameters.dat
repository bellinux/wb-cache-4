50|$|Alternatively, {{black holes}} {{play a role}} in cosmological natural {{selection}} by reshuffling only some matter affecting the distribution of elementary quark universes. The resulting population of universes can be represented as a distribution of a landscape of parameters where the height of the landscape is proportional to the numbers of black holes that a universe <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>parameters</b> will have. Applying reasoning borrowed from the study of fitness landscapes in population biology, one can conclude that the population is dominated by universes whose parameters drive the production of black holes to a local peak in the landscape.

50|$|Given a {{model and}} data, one can obtain a {{statistical}} model estimate. This model estimate can then be used to compute interesting quantities such as the conditional probability of the occurrence of a dragon king event in a future time interval, and the most probable occurrence time. When doing statistical modeling of extremes, and using complex or nonlinear dynamic models, there {{is bound to be}} substantial uncertainty. Thus, one should be diligent in uncertainty quantification: not only considering the randomness present in the fitted stochastic model, but also the uncertainty of its estimated parameters (e.g., with Bayesian techniques or by first simulating parameters and then simulating from the model <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>parameters),</b> and the uncertainty in model selection (e.g., by considering an ensemble of different models).|$|E
5000|$|A memoized {{function}} [...] "remembers" [...] {{the results}} corresponding to some set of specific inputs.

A function can only be memoized if it is referentially transparent; that is, only if calling the function has exactly the same effect as replacing that function call with its return value. (Special case exceptions to this restriction exist, however.) While related to lookup tables, since memoization often uses such tables in its implementation, memoization populates its cache of results transparently on the fly, as needed, rather than in advance.|$|E

After his previous film, Purple Violets, did not perform as hoped, Burns {{took the opportunity to}} re-educate himself on screenwriting. He recalled, [...] "I recognized after my film Purple Violets that I had gotten away from respecting traditional storytelling structure. I thought I knew it, but I stopped outlining and stopped thinking about audiences’ expectations. After that film I thought that I needed to go back and re-educate myself. So I went back and read a ton of books on Hollywood screenwriting and story structure. A lot of it I found very helpful {{and a lot of it}} I didn’t, but I know going back and having respect for structure helped me enormously as a screenwriter." [...] Knowing that Nice Guy Johnny would be a microbudget film (as were his following films, Newlyweds and The Fitzgerald Family Christmas), while writing the script Burns concentrated on how he could keep the cost of the film down. [...] " [...] With all three of those movies I would write down the list of locations that I knew I could get for free.

40|$|Reliable {{methods for}} the {{analysis}} of tolerance-affected analog circuits are of great importance in nowadays micro-electronics. It is impossible to produce circuits <b>with</b> exactly <b>those</b> <b>parameter</b> specifications proposed in the design process. Interval arithmetic can be used to obtain a worst-case analysis of the influence of component tolerances. This paper focuses on a new approach for interval-valued frequency-response analysis of linear analog circuits, which consist of current and voltage sources as well as resistors, capacitances, inductances, and all variants of controlled sources. Part and parcel of this strategy is the handling of fill-in patterns for <b>those</b> <b>parameters</b> related to uncertain components. Such systems can efficiently be solved by successive application of the Sherman-Morrison formula. The approach is also extended to complex-valued systems from frequency-domain analysis of linear circuits. Crude bounds can be obtained by treating real and imaginary part as different variables. The latter is improved by considering the correlations in order to obtain tighter enclosures of the solution...|$|R
