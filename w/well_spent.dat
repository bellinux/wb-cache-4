25|$|This view {{holds that}} the vast {{majority}} of problems had been fixed correctly, and the money was <b>well</b> <b>spent.</b> The situation was essentially one of preemptive alarm. Those who hold this view claim that the lack of problems at the date change reflects the completeness of the project, and that many computer applications would not have continued to function into the 21st century without correction or remediation.|$|E

25|$|The provinces were keen {{to insure}} that their money was <b>well</b> <b>spent.</b> From Habsburg times they {{therefore}} had claimed a role in combating the fraud that was endemic in the mercenary-army system. Every province therefore {{had the right to}} muster the troops that it paid for (and if these were garrisoned together with the troops that were paid for by other provinces, those other troops also, because otherwise the fraudulent interchange of troops would be too difficult to prevent).|$|E
25|$|Tom Brady {{stormed out}} the gates with a 19-yard {{completion}} to Kevin Faulk {{with his first}} pass attempt.

McNair struck back with a 15-yard completion to Derrick Mason and a 24-yard pass to running back Eddie George, moving {{the ball to the}} Patriots 22-yard line.

25|$|The {{stimulus}} package {{passed in the}} House of Representatives on January 28 without a single Republican vote.

The pay restrictions included prohibition of bonuses in excess of one-third of total salary for any company receiving any money from the plan and was retroactive to companies that received funds under Troubled Assets Relief Program. The limit was a significant alteration of the administration's plan and caught Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Chairman Lawrence Summers by surprise.|$|E

He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game. Eight players were later fined, including the Mets' Tim Teufel, who said, [...] "It was money <b>well</b> <b>spent.</b> Sometimes you just have to defend yourself and your teammates." ...|$|E
