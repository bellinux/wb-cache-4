5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who <b>were</b> <b>screaming</b> for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E

25|$|It was {{impossible}} to estimate the number involved {{with any degree of}} accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all tangled together, and everything was covered with a thick layer of black dust. Many of the victims were writhing in agony and <b>were</b> <b>screaming</b> for individual attention. It was obvious from an early stage that the main problem was the disentanglement of a heap of people, many of whom appeared to be in imminent danger of suffocation.|$|E

Another nightmare showed the stars falling down from heaven and kidnapping humans, then putting these beneath two large mountains. King Khufu then received a warning from his prophets about a devastating deluge, that would come and destroy Egypt. To protect his treasures and books of wisdom, Khufu built the three pyramids of Giza.|$|E

Inside the bridge underpasses (each 80 feet long, 22 feet wide and 40 feet high), they came under heavy machine gun and rifle fire from 7th Cavalry troops {{from both sides of}} the bridge. [...] "Children <b>were</b> <b>screaming</b> in fear and adults were praying for their lives, and the whole time they never stopped shooting," [...] said survivor Park Sun-yong, whose 4-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter were killed, while she was badly wounded.|$|E

In a Rolling Stone article, PewDiePie admitted to being shocked by his fame; PewDiePie recalled a gaming event near his hometown, stating [...] "I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up — it was out of control. It was shocking to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person." [...] At the 2013 Social Star Awards, PewDiePie greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so.

500|$|Martin Olson, {{the father}} of voice actress Olivia Olson, reprises his role as Hunson Abadeer in this episode, as well as [...] "Daddy's Little Monster"; Olson had {{previously}} appeared in the second season premiere [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere" [...] and the third season episode [...] "Memory of a Memory". The episode {{was also the first}} to give a name to Marceline's father: Hunson Abadeer. According to Moynihan, the name was inspired by the name that his brother had given their family's car when they were growing up. The two later used it for a band that only recorded one song. To create the demonic effect of Marceline talking while possessed with the amulet, Olivia Olson and her father were required to say their lines in tandem. She later explained: [...] "We were going back-and-forth, line to line … We <b>were</b> <b>screaming</b> back and forth at each other, and trying to match pitches and stuff. Then, hearing the after product of both of our voices blended together was pretty fun." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the long range shoot at Vieques, Iowas new {{executive}} officer, Commander John Morse, directed a main battery drill, {{over the objections of}} his gun crews, in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15° off the starboard side of the ship's bow. At this angle, one of Turret Two's guns was firing over Turret One. During the shoot, according to Turret Two's left gun captain, Jack Thompson, one of the powder bags in the left gun began to smolder before the breechlock was closed. Thompson said that he was barely able to close and latch the breechlock before the gun discharged on its own. The concussion from Turret Two's guns shredded Turret One's gun bloomers (the canvas covers {{at the base of the}} main gun barrels) and damaged Turret One's electrical system. Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was [...] "the most frightening experience I have ever had in my life. The shock wave blew out the turret officer's switchboard and the leads. We had no power, no lights for a time. Men <b>were</b> <b>screaming.</b> There was panic." ...|$|E

500|$|Trailing the Minnesota Vikings 20–19 with 72 {{seconds left}} in the fourth quarter at the Metrodome in week 11, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate 22-yard pass on fourth and 17 to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory 22–20. In the Giants' three previous games, Simms had completed only six passes to wide receivers. In the Giants' victory he completed eight to wide receivers, four to tight end Mark Bavaro and 13 to his running backs—four to Ottis Anderson in the final two drives, three to Maurice Carthon, three to Joe Morris and three to Tony Galbreath. Simms commented years later, [...] "t's my favorite game in my career, because it's everything I always wanted to be as a player. I wanted to be tough, making big throws, immune to pressure, not worried about outcomes. It was truly like standing on the tee box in golf and there's trees on each side and water and you just go 'Man, I'm gonna rip it down the middle.' And no other thought crosses your mind." [...] The game has frequently been credited as a signature game of their season, and the Giants players celebrated the victory in the tunnel leading to their locker room and in the locker room itself in a raucous manner that was highly atypical for the team. [...] "They high-fived themselves silly", recalled Peter King. [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>screaming</b> and hooting and raising hell—happier than they had been all year." ...|$|E
500|$|The Yankees {{faced the}} Cubs, McCarthy's former team, in the 1932 World Series. There was bad blood {{between the two}} teams as the Yankees resented the Cubs only {{awarding}} half a World Series share to Mark Koenig, a former Yankee. The games at Yankee Stadium had not been sellouts; both were won by the home team, with Ruth collecting two singles, but scoring four runs as he was walked four times by the Cubs pitchers. In Chicago, Ruth was resentful at the hostile crowds that met the Yankees' train and jeered them at the hotel. The crowd for Game Three included New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate for president, who sat with Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. Many in the crowd threw lemons at Ruth, a sign of derision, and others (as well as the Cubs themselves) shouted abuse at Ruth and other Yankees. They were briefly silenced when Ruth hit a three-run home run off Charlie Root in the first inning, but soon revived, and the Cubs tied the score at 4–4 in the fourth inning. When Ruth came to the plate {{in the top of}} the fifth, the Chicago crowd and players, led by pitcher Guy Bush, <b>were</b> <b>screaming</b> insults at Ruth. With the count at two balls and one strike, Ruth gestured, possibly in the direction of center field, and after the next pitch (a strike), may have pointed there with one hand. Ruth hit the fifth pitch over the center field fence; estimates were that it traveled nearly [...] Whether or not Ruth intended to indicate where he planned to (and did) hit the ball, the incident has gone down in legend as Babe Ruth's called shot. The Yankees won Game Three, and the following day clinched the Series with another victory. During that game, Bush hit Ruth on the arm with a pitch, causing words to be exchanged and provoking a game-winning Yankee rally.|$|E

The workers worked for [...] "well below minimum wage" [...] and endured foul smells, according to family of the victims and The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines. Pay was dependent {{on the number of}} shoes produced, creating wages as little as 300 pesos (US$6.70) in a 12-hour day (minimum wage is 481 pesos). Other survivors said that the company was not making required social security and health insurance payments. A survivor who escaped from the first floor remarked, [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>screaming</b> for help, holding on to the bars.
