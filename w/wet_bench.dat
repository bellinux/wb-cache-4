The goal of the treatment loop is to make these waters, presently being discharged to the fab's acid waste neutralization (AWN) station, suitable for recycling as feed water back into the fab's ultrapure water (UPW) plant. The MDL typically operates 2 shifts per day, 5 days per week. Without any treatment, {{the properties of the}} spent rinse waters now being collected {{have been shown to be}} compatible with recycling about 30 % (50 / 168) of the time (weekends primarily, when the fab is idling) which corresponds to about 12 % of the present water discharged from the fab to the AWN. The primary goal of adding a treatment loop is to increase the percentage of recyclable water from these 10 <b>wet</b> <b>benches</b> to near 100 %, increasing the percentage of total recyclable water to near 40 % of the total present fab discharge to the AWN. A second goal is to demonstrate compatibility with recycling this treated spent rinse water to the present R/O product water tank, reducing both the present volume of R/O reject water and the present load on the R/O. The approach taken to demonstrate achieving these goals is to compare all the common metrics of water quality for the treated spent rinse waters with those of the present R/O product water. Showing that the treated rinse water is equal or superior in quality to the water presently stored in the R/O tank by every metric all the time is assumed to be sufficient argument for proceeding with plans to incorporate recycling of these spent rinse waters back into MDL's R/O tank...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Various insect {{species have}} been added to genomic {{databases}} over the years. Thus, researchers can easily obtain online genomic information on invertebrates and insects. However, many incorrectly annotated genes are included in these databases, which can prevent the correct interpretation of subsequent functional analyses. To address this problem, we used a combination of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>bench</b> processes to select functional genes from public databases. Results Enolase is an important glycolytic enzyme in all organisms. We used a combination of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>bench</b> processes to identify functional enolases in the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmEno). First, we detected five annotated enolases from public databases using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search, and then through cDNA cloning, Northern blotting, and RNA-seq analysis, we revealed three functional enolases in B. mori : BmEno 1, BmEno 2, and BmEnoC. BmEno 1 contained a conserved key amino acid residue for metal binding and substrate binding in other species. However, BmEno 2 and BmEnoC showed a change in this key amino acid. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BmEno 2 and BmEnoC were distinct from BmEno 1 and other enolases, and were distributed only in lepidopteran clusters. BmEno 1 was expressed in all of the tissues used in our study. In contrast, BmEno 2 was mainly expressed in the testis with some expression in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion. BmEnoC was weakly expressed in the testis. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression of BmEno 2 and BmEnoC correlated with testis development; thus, BmEno 2 and BmEnoC may be related to lepidopteran-specific spermiogenesis. Conclusions We identified and characterized three functional enolases from public databases with a combination of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>bench</b> processes in the silkworm B. mori. In addition, we determined that BmEno 2 and BmEnoC had species-specific functions.

40|$|As device {{features}} {{scale down}} to 90 nm and Cu/low-k films are employed for back end interconnects, post etch and ash residue cleaning becomes increasingly challenging {{due to the}} higher aspect ratio of the features, tighter CD control requirements, sensitivity of the low-k films, and the requirement for high wet etch selectivity between CuxO and Cu. Traditional solvent based cleaning in <b>wet</b> <b>benches</b> has additional issues such as wafer cross-contamination and high disposal cost [1, 2]. We have developed a novel aqueous solution (AQ) based single wafer cleaning process to address these challenges. The results of physical characterization, process integration electrical data, and process integration reliability data such as electromigration (EM) and stress migration data are presented. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) The single wafer cleaning process developed on the Oasis ™ system can clean post etch residues and simultaneously clean the wafer front side and backside metallic contaminants; (2) In terms CuxO and Cu wet etch selectivity, CD loss control, the Oasis ™ aqueous single wafer clean process is superior to the bench solvent cleaning process; (3) The Oasis aqueous cleaning process shows no undercut below etchstop due to the very low Cu etch amount in one cleaning pass, therefore the electromigration and stress migration performance of the aqueous Oasis processed wafers is clearly better {{than that of the}} solvent bench processed wafers...|$|R
40|$|Recycling of {{the spent}} rinse water {{discharged}} from the <b>wet</b> <b>benches</b> commonly used in semiconductor processing is one tactic for responding to the targets for water usage published in the 1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS). Not only does the NTRS list a target that dramatically reduces total water usage/unit area of silicon manufactured by the industry in the future but for the years 2003 and beyond, the NTRS actually touts goals which would have semiconductor manufacturers drawing less water from a regional water supply per unit area of silicon manufactured than the quantity of ultrapure water (UPW) used {{in the production of}} that same silicon. Achieving this latter NTRS target strongly implies more widespread recycling of spent rinse waters at semiconductor manufacturing sites. In spite of the fact that, by most metrics, spent rinse waters are of much higher purity than incoming municipal waters, recycling of these spent rinse waters back into the UPW production plant is not a simple, straightforward task. The rub is that certain of the chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing, and thus potentially present in trace concentrations (or more) in spent rinse waters, are not found in municipal water supplies and are not necessarily removed by the conventional UPW production sequence used by semiconductor manufacturers. Some of these contaminants, unique to spent rinse waters, may actually foul the resins and membranes of the UPW system, posing a threat to UPW production and potentially even causing a shutdown...|$|R

Because the average rainfall in this metropolitan area of 500, 000 is approximately 8 inches per year, conservation of this precious resource {{is critical to}} the economic health of the city and state, and the continued operations at SNL/NM. To address this need, SNL/NM is taking a systematic, comprehensive approach to water conservation. The approach is to estimate the water consumption for all of SNL/NM by type of consumption.

A typical computer-based discovery scenario for many life scientists includes the creation of local caches of pertinent information from multiple online resources such as Swissprot [BA 00], PIR [BGH + 00], PDB [PDB 03], to enable efficient data analysis. This local caching of data, however, exposes their research and eventual results to the problems of data staleness, that is, cached data may quickly be obsolete or incorrect, dependent on the updates that are made to the source data. This represents a significant challenge to the scientific community, forcing scientists to be continuously aware of the frequent changes made to public data sources, and more importantly aware of the potential effects on their own derived data sets during the course of their research. To address this significant challenge, in this paper we present an approach for handling update propagation between heterogeneous databases, guaranteeing data freshness for scientists irrespective of their choice of data source and its underlyin...|$|R

Assays of mRNA expression have proven conclusively that PAX 3 and PAX 7 transcripts {{are present in}} embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, and melanoma cell lines; the tumor-specific expression patterns correspond to expression patterns in corresponding embryonic cell lineages. The intronic regions of the PAX 7 gene were analyzed using computational DNA pattern recognition methods. Several potential cis-regulatory motifs were identified in this investigation and one in particular that was common to both PAX 7 and PAX 3 and also to NF 1, could have implications {{for the role of}} PAX 7 in Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma and may be the cornerstone to more exciting, unique scientific investigations. Methods: In Silico biology methods are currently used in the pharmaceutical industry as an antecedent to <b>wet</b> chemistry and <b>bench</b> work. Here we employed several public online and offline programs/databases as tools to investigate the nucleotide sequences of the PAX 7 gene. Results: Several potential cis-acting elements within the intronic regions of PAX 7 were discovered through in silico biological methods. Transcription factors that could bind to these elements have also been identified and their association with cancer ascertained. Interestingly one cis element is found within a 155 bp sequence in intron 8 of PAX 7 that surprisingly, is also found within intron 10 of PAX 3 and is also found conserved within intron 23 of the NF- 1 gene. Discussion: The use of In Silico Biology methods represent new, faster, cost-efficient techniques to identify novel regulatory elements that provide areas for more in depth in vitro investigations to confirm their functional effects.

Examples are derived from familial hypercholesterolemia,familial HDL deficiency/Tangier disease and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. RECENT FINDINGS: About 5 - 10 % of genomic variants found in familial hypercholesterolemia,FHD/Tangier disease and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia {{are located in the}} introns of the candidate genes and are classified as splicing mutations. Although variants affecting highly conserved GT/AG dinucleotides at the splice sites are likely to be pathogenic,it is difficult to predict the effects of variants located deep in the introns.

Studies have shown that these complications can be linked to the activities of aldose reductase (AR), an enzyme of the polyol pathway. Flavonoids have been identified as good AR inhibitors (ARIs) and are also strong antioxidants with radical scavenging (RS) activity. As such, flavonoids show potential to become a better class of ARIs because they are able to concurrently address the oxidative stress issue. In this article, we carried out quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of flavones and flavonols (members of flavonoid family) using artificial neural networks. Three computer experiments were conducted to study the influence of hydrogen (H), hydroxyl (-OH), and methoxyl (-CH(3)) functional groups on eight substitution sites of the lead flavone molecule and to predict potential ARIs. Of 6561 possible flavones and flavonols, in experiment 1, we predicted 69 potent ARIs, and in experiment 2, we predicted 346 compounds with strong RS activity.

A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab- 2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe {{the results from the}} WetLab- 2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47 /SPX- 8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles.

40|$|In this article, in {{the first}} part, we propose an {{artificial}} neural network-based intelligent technique to determine the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) among known aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) for diabetes mellitus using two molecular descriptors, i. e., the electronegativity and molar volume of functional groups present in the main ARI lead structure. We {{have shown that the}} multilayer perceptron-based model is capable of determining the QSAR quite satisfactorily, with high R-value. Usually, the design of potent ARIs requires the use of complex computer docking and quantum mechanical (QM) steps involving excessive time and human judgement. In the second part of this article, to reduce the design cycle of potent ARIs, we propose a novel ANN technique to eliminate the computer docking and QM steps, to predict the total score. The MLP-based QSAR models obtained {{in the first}} part are used to predict the potent ARIs, using the experimental data reported by Hu et al. (J Mol Graph Mod 2006, 24, 244). The proposed ANN-based model can predict the total score with an R-value of 0. 88, which indicates that there exists a close match between the predicted and experimental total scores. Using the ANN model, we obtained 71 potent ARIs out of 6. 25 million new ARI compounds created by substituting different functional groups at substituting sites of main lead structure of known ARI. Finally, using high bioactivity relationship and total score values, we determined four potential ARIs out of these 71 compounds. Interestingly, these four ARIs include the two potent ARIs reported by Hu et al. (J Mol Graph Mod 2006, 24, 244) who obtained these through the complex computer docking and QM steps. This fact indicates the effectiveness of our proposed ANN-based technique.

40|$|Improvements {{during the}} tool {{development}} process {{are getting more}} and more important in high-tech industries. In general the equipment development process consists of two basic development phases: hardware and software development. These development phases also include the tests necessary to guarantee the correct equipment operation. This operation is measured against the requirements specification. The idealized equipment development (see Figure 1) would have the two phases overlapping to minimize the development time. Unfortunately this is not typically like this. More often there is a time gap between the end of the software development {{and the beginning of the}} software tests. This can happen when the hardware development takes more time than estimated. In effect this gap causes a financial risk as the planned overall development time might not be kept. Additionally there exists a risk that the software does not fulfill requirements which had to be changed during the hardware test phase. Then additional loops in the software development are required which extend the financial risk for the company and the tool development time. As the overall tool development times decrease statically the importance of simulation increases more and more important. It can be used in different project phases to reduce project risks, e. g. the risk of not fulfilling the requirements. Simulation is a tool which can support the company before, during and after the development of a new tool. Before the realization of a new tool the idea can be modeled within a simulation as a realization study to gather KPIs before spending a high amount of money for the development. These KPI often are throughput, cycle times, waiting times, utilization of equipment modules etc. A bottleneck analysis can be performed in very detail before realizing the equipment. In addition to this sometimes design errors appear during the realization of the simulation which can be corrected before realizing the incorrect ones in hard- and/or software. The disadvantage is that financial effort has to be spent while modeling with simulation. During the development phase the simulation can act as test tool simulating the behaviour of the real equipment for the software. This helps to test the interfaces of the equipment to the outer world which are often a very critical parts of the equipment development. Besides equipment crashes are avoided which might happen when starting software test on the equipment. Correcting these errors will cost money and time as equipment modules might be affected by these crashes and might need physical exchange. The simulation realizes reproducible behaviour which helps validating the equipment as errors and problems can more easily be figured out and their solution can be improved. Simulation often offers a visualization of the simulated equipment so that customers and developers can see what happens and compare it with their expectations. Furthermore the simulation can be used by the marketing department of the company to assist the marketing and sales stuff. Changing configuration parameters on-site with potential customers can convince them as they will directly get their KPIs calculated. The experiences in simulation at the department for cleanroom manufacturing have been built up in different research and development projects carried out in governmental funded and industry driven projects. Figure 2 shows different simulations on various levels: equipment level and factory level in particular. The model in the upper left corner shows the graphic of a photolithographic tool whose simulation has been extended in several projects so that it can now serve as test tool for scheduling software but also as stand alone simulation for presentation. The large figure in the center shows the visualization of a case study of a specific factory layout variation.

40|$|In this thesis, {{thin films}} are {{deposited}} by plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD) under pressure 1 torr and at temperature 350 ℃ with RF power 20 W. We investigate the characteristics of thin films with various H 2 diluted ratio of silane from 0 to 100 under different radio frequency, and discuss the electrical characteristics of solar cells. As results from Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), there are three turn-around points on hydrogen content (CH) curve and one turn around point on SiH 2 /(SiH+SiH 2) (RSi-H 2) curve with increase in H 2 diluted ratio of silane. The main domination is increasing concentration of hydrogen in the chamber and leads to form Si-H bonds, break Si-H bonds, and form Si-H 2 bonds. Under 40. 68 MHz RF power, the turn-around point occurs on larger R than 13. 56 MHz. For Raman spectrum measurement, we observe that the Raman crystalline factor increases with H 2 diluted ratio of silane increasing. The transformation from a-Si:H to c-Si under 40. 68 MHz RF power is in shorter range H 2 diluted ratio of silane than under 13. 56 MHz RF power. With the same H 2 diluted ratio of silane, each Raman crystalline factor in the c-Si thin film under 40. 68 MHz RF power is larger than that of 13. 56 MHz. The band gap of Si thin film decreases with decreasing in hydrogen content and increasing in crystalline size which is the main domination. With lower H 2 diluted ratio of silane, thin films are belong to a-Si:H and band gap decreases with hydrogen content decreasing. When the H 2 diluted ratio of silane is higher, band gap rises again like the first value, and decreases slowly with increasing in crystalline size and increasing in hydrogen content. Last, it decreases clearly with increasing in crystalline size and decreasing in hydrogen content. In the measurement of the electrical characteristic of the solar cell, short-circuit current decreases with increasing in RSi-H 2 until transformation from a-Si:H to c-Si in the thin films. The domination of open-circuit voltage interacts with hydrogen content and Raman crystalline factor which is the main domination. Thus, open-circuit voltage decreases with increasing in R. In this study, the highest deposition rate is 9. 09 Å/s with R= 0 under 13. 56 MHz RF power. hydrogen content in the a-Si:H and c-Si thin films is found less than 10 %. The turn around point of RSi-H 2 occurs with R= 10. Band gap is equal to 1. 710 eV under 13. 56 MHz RF power and equal to 1. 727 eV under 40. 68 MHz RF power at the transformation from a-Si:H to c-Si. The best transformed efficiency is 3. 106 % under 13. 56 MHz and 3. 057 % under 40. 68 RF power with R= 10. 在本論文中，是以電漿輔助化學氣相沉積方式在製程溫度 350 ℃、壓力設在 1 torr、射頻功率為 20 W的條件下製作氫化非晶矽薄膜，沉積設備的腔體長寬高分別為 44 cm、 44 cm與 15. 8 cm，內部的上電極直徑為 23. 5 cm，而上電極與基板之間的距離為 5 cm。接著以不同射頻頻率以及氫氣與四氫化矽的比值(R) 分別為 0 、 5 、 10 、 20 、 30 、 40 、 60 、 80 、 100 來探討各種薄膜的特性，進而觀察氫化非晶矽薄膜太陽能電池元件效率變化。 從傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜儀量測結果顯示，氫含量隨著R值上升而有三個轉折點，而在RSi-H 2 的部分，隨著氫氣與四氫化矽的比值上升而有一個轉折點，主要由腔體內混合氣體的氫濃度所導致，造成Si-H鍵的形成、Si-H鍵的破壞、Si-H 2 鍵的形成之間互相消長，並且在較高射頻頻率下，氫含量轉折點出現位置會較晚發生以及有比較大的RSi-H 2 。 從拉曼量測結果顯示，隨著R值上升，結晶率也會逐漸上升，在較大的射頻頻率下，從非晶矽轉變為結晶矽的過度期相對的比較小的射頻頻率來的短暫，且在相同的R值下有較大的結晶率。 在能隙量測方面，隨著R值上升，線條分成兩段式的下降，前一段來自於氫含量的減少使得能隙下降，後一段由於結晶矽的形成，使得能隙回升到一個高點然而隨著結晶顆粒變大而再次下降。 在電性上的量測，短路電流在非晶矽薄膜的部分隨著RSi-H 2 上升而下降直到變成結晶矽之後才回升，而影響開路電壓的原因則來自於結晶率(主因) 與氫含量(次因) 的交互作用，大致上可以發現隨著R值上升，開路電壓會逐漸下降。而在轉換效率部分，由於控制變因繁雜，並無法完全的找出規律性，但可找出最佳值。 在本論文中，鍍率最高為 9. 09 Å/s，發生在R= 0 ，射頻頻率 13. 56 MHz之下。氫含量大致上都是低於 10 %，RSi-H 2 的轉折點都發生在R= 10 的位置，在非晶矽轉變為結晶矽之後的能隙方面，在射頻頻率為 13. 56 MHz之下能隙為 1. 710 eV，而射頻頻率為 40. 68 MHz之下能隙為 1. 727 eV。轉換效率部分在射頻頻率為 13. 56 MHz之下，最高為 3. 106 %，發生在R= 10 ，而在射頻頻率為 40. 68 MHz之下，最高為 3. 057 %，發生在R= 10 。Acknowledgment…………………………………………………………………i Abstract (Chinese) …………………………………………… [...] . ………………. ii Abstract (English) ………………………………………………………………iii Contents…………………………………………………………………………… [...] iv Table List……………………………………………………………………… [...] . …vi Figure Captions…………………………………………………………………vii Chapter 1 Introduction	 1 1. 1 Background	 1 1. 2 Motivation	 2 1. 3 Thesis Organization	 3 Chapter 2 Basic Concept of Solar Cells	 4 2. 1 Operating Principle of Solar Cell	 4 2. 2 Types of Solar Cell's Structure	 5 2. 2. 1 PN Solar Cell	 5 2. 2. 2 PIN Solar Cell	 5 2. 2. 3 Tandem Solar Cell	 6 2. 3 The Characteristics of Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon Film	 7 2. 4 Extraction of Device Electrical Parameters	 8 2. 4. 1 Determination of Short-Circuit Current (Isc) 	 8 2. 4. 2 Determination of the Open-Circuit Voltage (Voc) 	 8 2. 4. 3 Determination of the Maximum Output Power (Pm) 	 8 2. 4. 4 Determination of the Power Conversion Efficiency (η) and Fill Factor (FF) 	 9 2. 5 Review of the Study on H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane	 10 Chapter 3 Experiment Procedure and Measuring Equipment	 12 3. 1 Fabrication and Measuring Equipments	 12 3. 1. 1 Steps of Cleaning Substrate by <b>Wet</b> <b>Bench</b>	 12 3. 1. 2 Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition System	 13 3. 1. 3 Thermal Evaporation Coater	 15 3. 1. 4 Configuration of the Measuring Equipments	 15 3. 2 Devices Fabrication	 18 3. 2. 1 Fabrication Procedures of a-Si:H Thin Films	 18 3. 2. 2 Fabrication Procedures of a-Si:H Solar Cells	 19 3. 3 Measuring Methods and Sequences	 20 3. 3. 1 Fourier transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR) 	 20 3. 3. 2 Raman Scattering Spectrometer	 23 3. 3. 3 Keithley I-V Measuring System	 24 Chapter 4 Results and Discussion	 25 4. 1 The Deposition Rates of a-Si:H Thin Films with Various H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane under Different Radio Frequency	 25 4. 2 Hydrogen Content (CH) and SiH 2 /(SiH+SiH 2) (RSi-H 2) under Various H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane and Different Radio Frequency	 27 4. 2. 1 Hydrogen Content (CH) with Various H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane under Different Radio Frequency	 27 4. 2. 2 The Ratio of SiH 2 /(SiH+SiH 2) (RSi-H 2) with Various H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane under Different Radio Frequency	 52 4. 3 Crystalline Volume Fraction (Xc) and Band Gap (Eg) with Various H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane under Different Radio Frequency. 	 77 4. 3. 1 Crystalline Volume Fraction (Xc) with Various H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane under Different Radio Frequency. 	 77 4. 3. 2 Band Gap (Eg) with Various H 2 Diluted Ratio of Silane under Different Radio Frequency. 	 101 Chapter 5 Conclusions	 113 Reference	 11...|$|E
