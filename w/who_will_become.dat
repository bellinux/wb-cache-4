500|$|The school {{uses the}} fictional sœur system where any second- or third-year student, the grande sœur ("big sister"), might pick a younger girl <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>become</b> her [...] "sœur" [...] (sister in French). The grande sœur {{gives her the}} petite sœur ("little sister") a rosary and {{promises}} to look after her and guide her. The basic etiquette demands the petite sœur to call her grande sœur [...] "onee-sama" [...] (older sister in Japanese). Aside from being used in prayer, the rosary is the instrument that certifies the sœur union and relationship between two students. There is an implicit code of behavior between sœurs, especially in the Yamayuri Council—the student council of the school: quietness, measure and respect towards each other; values deeply attached to traditional Japanese education.|$|E

The president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) begins to talk about the project, which encompasses creating a store to rival Apple's chain of stores, and Dwight and Packer start to compete to see <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>become</b> her vice president. However, Dwight begins having stomach pains, which Ryan suspects to be appendicitis. Dwight collapses during a presentation, the paramedics confirm appendicitis, and Dwight is rushed into surgery. However, three hours later, after getting his appendix removed, he returns in order to impress his new boss. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is [...] "desire." [...] Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day.|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} sources of bias in microcredit impact assessments. This paper uses a panel data set from a Peruvian MFI to test for impact of credit on microenterprise profits, while controlling for these biases. We find that those <b>who</b> <b>will</b> eventually <b>become</b> borrowers have significantly higher incomes than those <b>who</b> <b>will</b> not <b>become</b> borrowers, implying that selection into the lending programme is a substantial problem. After controlling for this selection, we find that an average microentrepreneur who borrows earns significantly higher enterprise profits than one who does not borrow, and that naive models, which do not control for selection, overestimate this impact. Fixed effects estimates give roughly the same results as the quasi-experimental cross-section analysis. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues (or Bucolics) in 42 BC and {{it is thought that}} the collection was published around 39–8 BC (although this assertion is not without its detractors). The Eclogues (from the Greek word for [...] "selections") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ("pastoral poetry") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. The fourth of these Eclogues can be dated to around 40 BC, during a time when the Roman Civil war seemed to be coming to an end. ‘’Eclogue’’ 4 largely concerns {{the birth of a child}} (puer) <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>become</b> divine and eventually rule over the world. Classicist H. J. Rose notes that the poem “is in a sense Messianic, since it contains a prophecy (whether meant seriously or not) of the birth of a wonder-child of more than mortal virtue and power, who shall restore the Golden Age.” ...|$|E
500|$|Anole {{is one of}} only 27 {{students}} at the Institute who does not lose his mutant powers in the aftermath of House of M, also known as Decimation or [...] "M-Day." [...] The squad system is dissolved and the remaining students are merged into one group. Shortly afterward, Emma Frost sets up an all-out brawl amongst the remaining students to determine <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>become</b> the new team of X-Men trainees (dubbed the [...] "New X-Men"); Victor is not selected for the squad, but remains at the school. When a resurrected and brainwashed Northstar returns with his sister Aurora and attacks the Institute, Anole finds him and is able to temporarily snap him out of the mind control set in place by the Children of the Vault. Anole's joy at seeing his former mentor is short-lived, as Northstar returns to his mind-controlled status and knocks him out. [...] The school is later attacked by Reverend William Stryker and his army of mutant-exterminating Purifiers. [...] This results in a bus full of Anole's classmates being killed and the murder of other friends at the school.|$|E
500|$|Tom Cross of Gamasutra {{commented that}} the {{characters}} in the Uncharted series were some of the few in video games to portray human sexuality realistically. However, he complained that the roles were predictable when compared to other fictional movie and television roles. He criticized, [...] "while Among Thieves creates interesting, fun characters, it still pigeon holes them into stock character story arcs: the good girl, the guy <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>become</b> good, and the bad girl, who is allowed to be sexually suggestive because the plot will ultimately remove her as a viable partner for the ultimately good guy." [...] Peadar Grogan of Edge commended the series for including strong female characters. Chris Roper of IGN stated that the characters of Uncharted are all unpredictable, and have a high level of character development. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer found this exploration of character emotion integral to the series story development. The character acting in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves received two nominations at the 13th Interactive Achievement Awards, for the acting of North as Drake and Black as Frazer. They were later nominated in 2011 in the VGA for voice acting. The nominees were North as Drake, Rose as Elena and Black as Chloe.|$|E
