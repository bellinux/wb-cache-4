5|$|Jagielski {{signed up}} to the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) in 1944, or in 1946 (sources vary). When the Polish Worker's Party {{transformed}} into the Polish United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (PZPR) in 1948, he {{became a member of}} the new party. From 1946 to 1949, Jagielski served on the Central Board of the Związek Samopomocy Chłopskiej (Association of Peasant Self-Help), a communist organization designed to take control of the countryside. From 1950 to 1952 he was on the Central Board of the State Agricultural Farms and from December 1952 to December 1953 he was a deputy director of that institution. In December 1953, he became the Director of the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee of the Polish United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> a position he would hold until December 1956.|$|E
5|$|Nine of the {{registered}} parties {{did not have}} representation in the parliament before or {{as a result of}} the elections: the Communist Party, Senior Citizens' Party, Communist Workers' Party – For Peace and Socialism, <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> Independence Party, For the Poor, Pirate Party, Change 2011, and Freedom Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Bormann {{joined the}} National Socialist German <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (Nazi Party; NSDAP). His {{membership}} number was 60,508. He joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) on 1 January 1937 with number 278,267. By special order of Heinrich Himmler in 1938, Bormann was granted SS number 555 to reflect his Alter Kämpfer (Old Fighter) status.|$|E
50|$|In the 2011 General Elections, Yaw {{from the}} <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> won the seat for Hougang SMC against PAP's Desmond Choo, taking 64.81% of the valid votes. However, on 15 February 2012, Yaw was {{expelled}} from the <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> due to allegations of extramarital affairs. A by-election was then called for 26 May 2012. Png Eng Huat of the <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> and Desmond Choo of the People's Action Party ran for Hougang SMC. The <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> retained Hougang SMC with a winning vote percentage of 62.09% and the People's Action Party garnered 37.91% of the votes, with Png elected as the Member of Parliament for Hougang SMC.|$|R

5|$|In March 1954, {{he became}} a deputy {{to a member of}} the Central Committee of the Polish United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> and would retain this {{position}} until March 1959. As a result of the January 1957 Polish legislative elections, Jagielski was appointed as a deputy to the Sejm, the Polish legislative body. In January of that year, he also became the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture in October 1959, a position he would hold until June 1970. In March 1959, he was appointed a full member of the Central Committee of the Polish United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (he was previously a deputy to a full member). In June 1964, {{he became a}} deputy to a member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party and would hold that position until December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat {{members who}} had {{supported}} Shachtman were expelled by the emergency conference, {{with the support of}} Trotsky himself. While leader of the SWP James P. Cannon later said that he did not believe the split to be definitive and final, the two groups did not reunite. A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the Socialist <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trotsky {{opened a}} public debate with Shachtman and Burnham and {{developed}} his positions {{in a series}} of polemics written in 1939–1940 and later collected in In Defense of Marxism. Shachtman and Burnham's tendency resigned from the International in early 1940, alongside almost 40% of the SWP's members, many of whom became founder members of the <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party was essentially a rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Saint Lucia gained full {{independence}} in 1979. Immediately beforehand, Odlum organised large protests {{in front of}} international news cameras, further cementing {{his role in the}} region's communist and socialist movement. Three weeks after independence, the nearby country of Grenada saw the overthrow of its government by communists revolutionaries led by Maurice Bishop. When the United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> called a general election in Saint Lucia three weeks later, Compton's government fell – Odlum was returned to Parliament and the Labour Party, led by Allan Louisy, came to power.|$|E
50|$|At the 5th Congress of the <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> in 1970 he {{was elected}} to the Central Committee. In 1973 he was {{promoted}} to general and made chairman of the Politburo of the Korean People's Army. He was subsequently elected to the Politburo of the <b>Worker's</b> <b>Party</b> of Korea in 1974.|$|R

5|$|The most {{important}} groups that lacked {{representation in the}} Underground State included the communist (Polish <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> (PPR) and its military arm, the Gwardia Ludowa), and the far right (Group Szaniec and its military arm, the Military Organization Lizard Union). Both the extreme left (the communists) and the extreme right (the nationalists) saw themselves {{in opposition to the}} Underground State. Only the PPR, however, opposed to Polish independence and supporting full inclusion of Poland in the Soviet Union, was seen as completely outside the framework of the State; the other groups were seen as a legitimate opposition. In 1944 PPR would become part of the PKWN Soviet puppet government.|$|E
5|$|Louisy {{had become}} Prime Minister {{thanks to a}} secret {{agreement}} with Odlum that he would resign, allowing Odlum to take over, within 6 months. When the time came Louisy refused, backed by the Americans, who wanted to keep Odlum out of office at all costs. This saw Odlum turn against his own government and even vote against the budget. A second proposal that Louisy resign was rejected on 30 December 1980, with the power struggle continuing despite his agreement to hand over some of his portfolios. The dispute continued into 1981, with Odlum attracting controversy by announcing on 3 March {{that he had not}} ignored the possibility of his grouping within the Labour Party splitting and joining the United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party,</b> the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} the 1981 {{dismissal}} of Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister and the resignation of Louisy. Louisy was succeeded not by Odlum, but by Winston Cenac, who himself resigned eight months later on 16 January 1982. Cenac was succeeded by Michael Pilgrim in an attempt by moderates in the Labour Party to avoid the possibility of Odlum leading the country. By this point Odlum had left the party, forming the Progressive Labour Party (PLP). Pilgrim's government also collapsed, necessitating an early general election in 1982 in which the Labour Party was left with only 3 of the 17 seats, returning the United <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> to government and seeing Odlum dismissed from Parliament. His Progressive Labour Party won only a single seat.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> {{has fallen}} {{heir to the}} present radical {{political}} situation in the United States. Is it built to represent the American worker? So far the radical movement has represented the European worker in the United States. The opportunities for a radical political party are as great as, or greater than, ever before; the important problem before the <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> is to get radical ideas before the workers. Its second and more serious problem is to establish proper relations with Moscow. Moscow is strong; the <b>Workers</b> <b>Party</b> is weak; Moscow can dominate without any trouble.|$|E
