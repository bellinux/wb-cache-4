25|$|When {{band members}} are marching in one {{direction}} but <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces {{in the direction of}} play. This is known as lateral marching, but is more commonly known as either shifting, traversing, or sliding. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a crab step when moving sideways. During a crab step, the musician crosses one leg over the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.|$|E

However, he also noted it as his greatest weakness, since worrying about his friends tends {{to put him in}} danger. When asked in an interview if he had any plans to focus on the love triangle between Ichigo, Orihime, and Rukia, Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it as he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on romance. Kubo attributes Ichigo's popularity among readers {{to the fact that he}} [...] "looks cool". He also mentioned that as people read more about him they will discover that he is a warm and kind-hearted person.|$|E

500|$|The writers altered Jason's character. Mears {{describes}} him as {{a combination}} of John Rambo, Tarzan, and the Abominable Snowman from Looney Tunes. To Mears, Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back; {{he is supposed to}} be more sympathetic in this film. However, Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with [...] not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. They decided against an origin story because they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on Jason's tormented childhood because the producers felt that would [...] "demystify" [...] the character in an unhelpful manner. Fuller said, [...] "We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} Intimacy were {{inspired}} by a relationship break-up Okereke went through {{at the end of}} 2007. The lyricist told Rolling Stone, [...] "I wouldn't want anyone to think it's the clichéd break-up record but I haven't written about true, personal experiences all that much in the past." [...] The move to more intimate subject matter was [...] "semi-conscious" [...] because the band members did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works. Three tracks allude to Greek mythology: [...] "Ares" [...] draws its name from the god of war, [...] "Trojan Horse" [...] is named after the Trojan War military ruse, and [...] "Zephyrus" [...] draws its name from the god of the west wind. The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that [...] "it's about moments of shared vulnerability". [...] "Better Than Heaven" [...] references the Garden of Eden and , because the lyricist wanted to explore the themes of sex and death, especially in a biblical context.|$|E
500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E

During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet cafe with friends; on this topic, PewDiePie has commented, [...] "Sweden has a great culture around gaming." [...] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011. On his decision, PewDiePie has stated, [...] "Thinking about it now, it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A's, but somehow I was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos." [...] While his reason for leaving Chalmers has often been reported as a <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on his YouTube career, in 2017, PewDiePie clarified, [...] "Why does everyone get this story wrong? [...] I dropped out of university because I didn't like it. To drop out of university to pursue YouTube, that'd just be fucking stupid." [...] He added that [...] "industrial management and economics [...] boring as hell [...] I couldn't relate to fucking anyone." ...|$|E

Once, when studying trumpet, Elliot had asked him to [...] "buzz into the wrong end of the mouthpiece and sing into it as well".

2500|$|Clough's {{decision}} led to extensive {{accusations of}} censorship and {{claims that the}} Smithsonian was caving in to pressure from {{a small group of}} vocal activists.

[...] "We don't want to shy away from anything that is controversial, but we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the museum's and this show's strengths." [...] Kurin expressed the Smithsonian's desire to be responsive to public opinion, but also emphasized the remaining exhibit's importance. [...] "We are sensitive to what the public thinks about our shows and programs," [...] he said. [...] "We stand behind the show. It has strong scholarship with great pieces by artists who are recognized by a whole panoply of experts. It represents a segment of America." [...] On December 13, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, one of the principal sponsors of the exhibit, said it would ask for its $100,000 donation back if the film was not restored. Clough replied, [...] "...the Smithsonian's decision to remove the video was a difficult one and we stand by it." [...] The donation was returned, and the Warhol Foundation ceased to support National Portrait Gallery exhibits. The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, which donated $10,000 to support the exhibit, also ended all funding for future Smithsonian exhibitions. Both decisions drew criticism from some gay rights supporters, who felt the funding cuts were too draconian {{in view of the fact}} that the remainder of the pieces continued to be exhibited.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{production}} of series one, Davies took Clarke and Coduri out for dinner to discuss their contracts for the second series. Davies reveals that Clarke was excited about Mickey's development in the second series, particularly having the chance to carry a large gun and be an action hero. Clarke noted that he was [...] "amazed" [...] by the scripts for the second series, as he felt Mickey had at times been written as a [...] "buffoon". He felt that the character had gotten [...] "progressively braver" [...] throughout the series and that as an actor he found it fulfilling that people had gone from disliking the character to saying [...] "how they love this guy now". Mickey's character arc sees him join the Doctor and Rose as a companion, becoming in turn the shows first ethnic minority companion. Billie Piper explained that this upsets Rose initially because she [...] "likes to keep her life separate" [...] and [...] "wants The Doctor to herself because she's selfish like that". Tennant stated that through his actions, Mickey [...] "earns his spot on board the TARDIS". Clarke stated that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on his status as the show's first ethnic minority companion, stating [...] "the fact that I {{happen to be a}} black actor is beside the point, I'm an actor first". However, he felt that it provided a positive effect in that young fans of ethnic origin would no longer have to be a monster or alien when role-playing characters from the series.|$|E
