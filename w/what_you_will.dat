25|$|By 1601, he {{was well}} known in London {{literary}} circles, particularly {{in his role as}} enemy to the equally pugnacious Ben Jonson. Jonson, who reported to Drummond that Marston had accused him of sexual profligacy, satirized Marston in Clove in Every Man Out of His Humour, as Crispinus in Poetaster, and as Hedon in Cynthia's Revels. Jonson criticised Marston for being a false poet, a vain, careless writer who plagiarised the works of others and whose own works were marked by bizarre diction and ugly neologisms. For his part, Marston may have satirized Jonson as the complacent, arrogant critic Brabant Senior in Jack Drum's Entertainment and as the envious, misanthropic playwright and satirist Lampatho Doria in <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Will.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|Minogue's {{efforts to}} be taken seriously as a {{recording}} artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not [...] "paid her dues" [...] and {{was no more than a}} manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, [...] "If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product.

[...] She found it strange that the Bree, Andrew, and Danielle characters showed little emotion {{in regards to}} Rex's death. Additionally, she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan, a character [...] "so often saddled with the comic relief of the show, had a sad and serious premiere." [...] Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, stating the episode delivered [...] "lots of juicy resolution, several power suits, and (you guessed it) lots of tears and shouting." [...] The Futon Critic selected [...] "Next" [...] as the 42nd best television episode of 2005, writing, [...] "Say <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> about the show's rocky sophomore season but one can't deny how strongly it started," [...] and citing the tie-changing scene as the episode's most memorable moment.|$|E

Global News wrote of their long-standing relationship, [...] "Victor is the consummate womanizer {{and has been a}} part of many relationships over the years. Nonetheless, his heart belongs to one woman alone, the stunning Nikki Reed. Despite true love and good intention, the relationship between Victor and Nikki has always been troubled by poor timing and miscommunication." [...] In 1990, The Washington Times wrote that, [...] "Victor Newman's sudden marriage to Ashley Abbott fooled us all." [...] In 1995, Sports Illustrated wrote of Victor's marriage to Hope, saying a [...] "man with that much power could have married anyone, but he fell in love with a blind woman. Not for what she is, but who she's about." [...] In 2002, Entertainment Weekly wrote that the soap opera was [...] "keeping it real" [...] with Victor and Nikki's third wedding. Upon their fourth wedding in 2013, the magazine stated: [...] "Say <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> about Victor (and we’ve all said a lot), but the ol’ boy definitely knows who is best for him — Nikki." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1893, the {{distance}} between the pitcher and home plate was extended by nine feet, resulting in a dramatic increase in batting averages. The rule change helped Zimmer statistically, as he compiled a [...]308 batting average, the first of four [...]300 seasons. However, Zimmer bemoaned the rule change's effect on pitchers: [...] "They are making the pitcher a mere automaton. By and by they will make him stand on a cake of ice and pitch. Say <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>will,</b> the pitcher is the central figure in the game. People pay their money to see base ball, and the more scientific it is the better.

Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government.
