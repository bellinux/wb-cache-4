5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
25|$|Art is not {{a matter}} of taste, but {{involves}} the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As we take the derivative, and each time we do so <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> down the tangent vector , when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would need at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E

25|$|One major {{difference}} between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the Slippery Slope Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act {{on the grounds that it}} may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.|$|E

500|$|In late November 1910, a large naval revolt, later {{named the}} Revolt of the Lash, {{broke out in}} Rio de Janeiro. The tension was kindled by the racial makeup of the navy's regular crewmembers, who were heavily black or mulatto, whereas their {{officers}} were mostly white. The Baron of Rio Branco commented: [...] "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless lumpen, without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos." ...|$|E

500|$|Later in 2002, Linkin Park {{released}} an album entitled Reanimation. It included {{the songs of}} Hybrid Theory remixed and reinterpreted by nu metal and underground hip hop artists. Contributors to the album included Black Thought, Pharoahe Monch, Jonathan Davis, Stephen Carpenter, and Aaron Lewis. The sound of later Linkin Park albums would involve experimentation with classical instruments such as strings and piano, both of which, along with the same elements of electronica from Hybrid Theory, are prominently included in the band's second studio album Meteora. As Shinoda explains {{the difference in the}} sound between Hybrid Theory and Meteora: [...] "That electronic element has always been there in the band – it's just that sometimes <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> it closer to the front." ...|$|E
500|$|In his speeches, Morales {{presented}} the coca leaf {{as a symbol}} of Andean culture that was under threat from the imperialist oppression of the U.S. In his view, the U.S. should deal with their domestic cocaine abuse problems without interfering in Bolivia, arguing that they had no right trying to eliminate coca, a legitimate product with many uses which played a rich role in Andean culture. In a speech on this issue, Morales told reporters [...] "I am not a drug trafficker. I am a coca grower. I cultivate coca leaf, which is a natural product. I do not refine (it into) cocaine, and neither cocaine nor drugs have ever been part of the Andean culture." [...] On another, he asserted that [...] "We produce our coca, <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> it to the main markets, we sell it and that's where our responsibility ends." ...|$|E

Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it [...] "builds on this idea of the reflection that you know is fake but can't look away from and internalizes it". With the plot twist, Stuart said, [...] "we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything". He also affirmed it questions [...] "our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story".|$|E

500|$|This {{technological}} modernization in the Brazilian Navy was not {{matched by}} social change, and {{tensions between the}} Brazilian Navy's officer core versus the regular crewmembers kindled much unrest. A quote from the Baron of Rio Branco, the esteemed politician and professional diplomat, shows one {{of the sources of}} tension: [...] "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless lumpen, without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos." [...] Racial differences in the Brazilian Navy would have been immediately apparent to an observer at the time: the officers in charge of the ship were nearly all white, while the crews were heavily black or, to a lesser extent, mulatto. The visual differences belied deeper distinctions: darker-skinned crewmen, who {{by the time of the}} revolt would have been older slaves freed under the Lei Áurea (or sons born free under the 1871 Law of the Free Womb), were almost universally less educated than their white overseers.|$|E
500|$|An analogy has {{frequently}} been drawn between the European Crusades of the Middle Ages {{and the modern}} day Zionist movement. This view, which has been espoused by Arab media and political leaders, has also been discussed in Israeli academia. Prawer was often asked to comment on this analogy, and claimed that a major difference was that the Jews settled the land and worked it, whereas the Crusaders lorded over a conquered land worked by the natives. [...] Ronnie Ellenblum, a lecturer at Hebrew University, identifies a subliminal objective in Prawer's work to draw {{a distinction between the}} two: [...] "He's always writing about the Crusaders' manpower shortage and about their not settling the land...He claims that their presence here was principally urban, consisting of nobility and merchants. This is why they lost in the end. The implications are obvious: If <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> enough immigrants, and if we settle the land, we are bound to succeed." [...] (Ellenblum himself has shown that Crusader settlement in the Holy Land was much more widespread than previously thought and has found evidence of hundreds of Crusader farms.) But he also notes that [...] "if Joshua Prawer were alive today he would no doubt deny any linkage between his Zionist political beliefs and the model of segregation that he developed." ...|$|E

500|$|A reunion {{episode was}} speculated after the fifth series ended; in the 2003 {{documentary}} Cold Feet: The Final Call, executive producer Andy Harries stated, [...] "By killing a character, you are truly saying 'this series is over' … until, of course, in 10 years time when money {{is running a}} bit short for all of us, <b>we</b> <b>bring</b> it back. What we do with Rachel, I don't know yet—but I have got a few theories." [...] In an interview published in October 2003, Harries told The Daily Telegraph that ITV would [...] "probably" [...] bring back Cold Feet ten years after it ended, and said, [...] "There's a tacit understanding with the actors that we will re-visit it again at the appropriate time." [...] In 2007, a tabloid newspaper quoted an ITV [...] "insider" [...] as saying that a reunion episode would be broadcast to mark ten years since the pilot aired. The report {{turned out to be}} a fabrication. At the 2010 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Harries stated that discussions about the series' return were [...] "ongoing", but highlighted a number of factors that would prevent a reunion in the near future. The following day, Harries told Kate Silverton that he had held discussions with Mike Bullen about the series returning, but that it would not be back on television screens in 2011 or 2012.|$|E

[...] Leah Collins of Canadian magazine Dose wrote, [...] "It's all very sultry and intimate to a point—that point being the moment she unveils a line-up of back-up dancers." [...] Similarly, a writer of the website Idolator commented, [...] "'Dance for You' doesn't compare to the spectacle of say, the 'Run the World (Girls)' clip, but it is effective. [...] It's a mostly private dance—until all those other ladies show up." [...] The writer also called Beyoncé a femme fatale in the video. Likewise, Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post wrote that Beyoncé [...] "goes full on femme fatale" [...] and concluded that the concept of the video [...] "is about as straightforward as can be". Marc Hogan of Spin magazine noted, [...] "The video follows pretty literally from the song's theme, with Mrs. Jay-Z grinding sensuously." [...] A writer of Vibe magazine noted that Beyoncé was [...] "keeping things sexy" [...] with the video for the song.|$|E
