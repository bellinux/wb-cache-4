500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics.

500|$|Going {{into the}} event, Phelps' compatriot Ian Crocker {{was seen as}} the swimmer with the best chance of beating Phelps. Crocker beat Phelps' 100 metre {{butterfly}} world record in 2003, and had since lowered it twice: once at the 2004 United States Olympic trials, and then at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal. Before the Olympics, Crocker and Phelps held the seventeen fastest times ever in the event. In 2004, Crocker was the favorite in the men's 100 metre butterfly, but lost to Phelps by four hundredths of a second. This victory gave Phelps the right to swim in the final of the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, however he gave up the spot to Crocker, and took his turn in the semifinals. Although holding the world record, Crocker had lost the last four times that he was up against Phelps in the 100 metre butterfly, including the 2008 United States Olympic Trials. Some thought that Crocker was not in the same shape that he was when <b>we</b> <b>broke</b> the world record, including Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) analyst Byron MacDonald who said that [...] "If he's (Crocker) going to beat Phelps in Beijing, Crocker has to get close to his world record time of 50.40.

500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>broke</b> Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E

500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, <b>we</b> <b>broke</b> those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters.

After Live Aid and Arcadia, drummer Roger Taylor retired to the English countryside, suffering from exhaustion.

An official press release was issued in April 1986 confirming his departure. In a 2004 interview with Live Daily, Roger Taylor confirmed his reasons for leaving: [...] "I was burned out. I think I was just exhausted. It was a very intense five years. We didn't stop.

He had killed a buffalo and was skinning it when the advance guard of the Sioux shot and wounded him.

2500|$|In August 1942, Gavin {{became the}} {{commanding}} officer of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (505th PIR) at Fort Benning which had been activated shortly before on July 6. He was, aged just 35, promoted to colonel shortly thereafter. Gavin built this regiment from the ground up. He led his troops on long marches and realistic training sessions, creating the training missions himself and leading the marches personally. He also placed great value on having his officers [...] "the first out of the airplane door and the last in the chow line". This practice has continued to and with present-day U.S. airborne units. After months of training, Gavin had the regiment tested one last time:As we neared our time to leave, {{on the way to}} war, I had an exercise that required them to leave our barracks area at 7:00 P.M. and march all night to an area near the town of Cottonwood, Alabama, a march about 23 miles. There we maneuvered all day and in effect we seized and held an airhead. <b>We</b> <b>broke</b> up the exercise about 8:00 P.M. and started the troopers back by another route through dense pine forest, by way of backwoods roads. About 11:00 P.M., we went into bivouac. After about one hour's sleep, the troopers were awakened to resume the march. [...] In 36 hours the regiment had marched well over 50 miles, maneuvered and seized an airhead and defended it from counterattack while carrying full combat loads and living off reserve rations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} debate is a long-running {{controversy}} {{about the risks}} and benefits of using nuclear reactors to generate electricity for civilian purposes. [...] The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, as more and more reactors were built and came online, and [...] "reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies" [...] in some countries. [...] Thereafter, the nuclear industry created jobs, focused on safety and public concerns [...] mostly waned. In the last decade, however, with growing public awareness about climate change and the critical role that carbon dioxide and methane emissions plays in causing the heating of the earth's atmosphere, there's been a resurgence in the intensity nuclear power debate once again. [...] Nuclear power advocates and those who are most concerned about climate change point to nuclear power's reliable, emission-free, high-density energy and a generation of young physicists and engineers working to bring a new generation of nuclear technology into existence to replace fossil fuels. On the other hand, skeptics can point to two frightening nuclear accidents, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and subsequently the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, combined with escalating acts of global terrorism, to argue against continuing use of the technology. The debate continues today between those who fear the power of nuclear and those who fear {{what will happen to the}} earth if we don't use nuclear power. At the 1963 ground-breaking for what would become the world's largest nuclear power plant, President John F. Kennedy declared that nuclear power was a [...] "step on the long road to peace," [...] and that by using [...] "science and technology to achieve significant breakthroughs" [...] that we could [...] "conserve the resources" [...] to leave the world in better shape. Yet he also acknowledged that the Atomic Age was a [...] "dreadful age" [...] and [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>broke</b> the atom apart, we changed the history of the world." ...|$|E
