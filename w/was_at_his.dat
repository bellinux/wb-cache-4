5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891 he was {{considered}} by many to be the top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La Fleche. By the time he retired at the end of the 1893 season, he had earned £32,528 throughout his racing career. This was the third highest of any horse in history, behind only Donovan and Ayrshire. When Orme <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best, John Porter rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom Porter also trained. Porter also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four than he had been at two and three.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, Kosar's {{physical}} decline {{had long}} been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice. Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top. While he recognized {{it would be an}} unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in Vinny Testaverde from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick named Kosar the starter before the 1993 season, but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after he threw his third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13–0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde the starter. On the verge of tears after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed with the decision and felt he had done what he could with what <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> disposal.|$|E

5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was {{composed}} of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, {{and a number of}} other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit. Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating probation; this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life. Bruce began his professional wrestling career after getting out of jail, and it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> first show that he met Rob Van Dam and Sabu, two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends. During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.|$|E
5|$|From 1933, Allen {{worked in}} the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was {{appointed}} England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played irregularly for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> most effective during his two tours of Australia when {{he was able to}} build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.|$|E
5|$|He {{died from}} natural causes at age 95 {{at his home}} in Studio City, Los Angeles on December 18, 2006 at 11:44p.m., ending a 70-year career in animation. His wife Sheila <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> side. He was also survived by two grand{{children}} and five great-grandchildren. He was also survived by three children from his first marriage, Jayne (who worked for Hanna–Barbera), Lynn, and Neal. He is buried in a private section of the Great Mausoleum in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park.|$|E

5|$|He faced {{a similar}} {{challenge}} with the impoverished bishopric of Argyll in the 1240s. He {{was given the}} job of restoring {{the viability of the}} diocese and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King Alexander II of Scotland. Clement was with the king during his campaign in Argyll in 1249 and <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. By 1250 he had established {{a reputation as one of}} the most active Dominican reformers in Britain. Clement helped to elevate Edmund of Abingdon and Queen Margaret to sainthood. After his death, he received veneration as a saint himself, although he was never formally canonised.|$|E
5|$|John Doukas {{was born}} circa 1064, the second {{son of the}} domestikos ton scholon Andronikos Doukas, son of the Caesar John Doukas, and his wife, Maria of Bulgaria, the granddaughter of Tsar Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria (r. 1015–1018). John was thus the {{brother-in-law}} of Alexios I Komnenos, who had married his sister Irene Doukaina. In 1074, during the rebellion of the Norman mercenary Roussel de Bailleul, John, along with his elder brother Michael, <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> grandfather the Caesars estates in Bithynia. Roussel demanded that the Caesar give up the two as hostages in return for releasing their wounded father, whom he held captive. The elder John Doukas agreed, and the two were imprisoned by Roussel; Michael managed to escape, but the younger John remained with Roussel until the latter's defeat and capture by the Turks of Artuk later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{began his}} celebrated opening {{partnership}} with Miller during the 1946–47 season which {{saw the first}} Ashes series against England. Lindwall brought up his maiden Test century in the Second Test and was the leading wicket-taker as Australia established its ascendancy in the post-war era. He topped the bowling the following season against India and then led the Australian attack during its celebrated Invincibles tour of England. He took 86 wickets for the tour, including 27 in the Tests, the most by any bowler. He <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best in the Fifth Test at The Oval, when England were skittled for only 52, taking 6/20 as the hosts were unable to cope with his high-pace swing. Lindwall's efforts saw him named {{as one of the}} five Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where {{important}} {{scientists were}} captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gertner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> laboratory in Tailfingen, while Werner Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg's laboratory in Hechingen, and the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg's team had built in Berlin {{had been moved}} to Haigerloch.

5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk dress shirt beneath his unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> throat. He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch their Staffelführer.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{joined the}} King in the advance on London, playing {{a key role}} in the {{resulting}} Battle of Edgehill in October. Once again, Rupert <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best with swift battlefield movements; the night before, he had undertaken a forced march and seized the summit of Edgehill, giving the Royalists a superior position. When he quarrelled with his fellow infantry commander, Lindsey, however, some of the weaknesses of Rupert's character began to display themselves. Rupert vigorously interjected—probably correctly, but certainly tactlessly—that Lindsey should deploy his men in the modern Swedish fashion that Rupert was used to in Europe, which would have maximised their available firepower. The result was an argument in front of the troops and Lindsey's resignation and replacement by Sir Jacob Astley. In the subsequent battle Rupert's men made a dramatic cavalry charge, but despite his best efforts a subsequent scattering and loss of discipline turned a potential victory into a stalemate.|$|E

5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players thought that was {{sometimes}} unnecessarily defensive in his approach to batting and that he <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian team mate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Erwin Gutawa, {{who had previously}} collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, {{he said that he}} felt guilty as he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time they had worked together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye were singing about having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, felt she owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> 2003 Dekade concert.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rested Lindwall for {{the second}} tour match against Leicestershire, which ended in an innings victory for the Australians. Lindwall {{returned}} for the next fixture against Yorkshire at Bradford, but bowled only nine overs {{for a total of}} 1/16. He made a duck in the first innings on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling, as Australia scraped home by four wickets. Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings. The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to bat, but Neil Harvey and Don Tallon saw Australia to the target without further loss. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. They batted first and Lindwall managed only four, clean bowled by Alec Bedser, as Australia amassed 632. He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2/15 in the first innings. Bradman used Lindwall sparingly, taking a match total of 3/45 from 25 overs as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Fingleton felt that Lindwall <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> fastest for the season during the Surrey match. One of Lindwall's bouncers flew over three feet above the batsman's head.|$|E
