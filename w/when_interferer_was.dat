30|$|To {{treat the}} {{capacity}} of a decentralized ad hoc wireless network, the transport capacity, defined {{as the product of}} the end-to-end sum throughput and distance, has been introduced due to the difficulty in determining the capacity region of a large ad hoc network [8].

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} interference suppression in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems over fading channels. An adaptive array receiver is presented which integrates multiuser detection, beamforming, and RAKE reception to mitigate cochannel interference and fading. The adaptive multiuser detector is formulated using a blind constrained energy minimization criterion and adaptation is carried out using a novel algorithm based on set-membership parameter estimation theory. The proposed detector overcomes the shortcomings of conventional LMS- and RLS-type algorithms, namely, that of slow convergence and large computational load, respectively. This is especially the case <b>when</b> strong <b>interferers</b> <b>are</b> present or <b>when</b> the number of adaptive weights is relatively large. DS-CDMA systems can have a relatively large number of spatially distributed <b>interferers.</b> Thus beamforming <b>is</b> based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates provided by an approximate maximum-likelihood estimator (DOA-MLE). Unlike previous approaches, the DOA-MLE exploits {{the structure of the}} DS-CDMA signaling scheme resulting in robust performance and simple implementation in the presence of angle spreading. The overall method is suitable for real-time implementation and can substantially improve the interference suppression capabilities of a CDMA system.

Additionally, we consider the AME. Note that AME quantifies the loss of performance <b>when</b> the <b>interferer</b> users <b>are</b> present and the background noise vanishes [2 – 4].

A fundamental issue for emulation is the replication of communication links of specified quality. In particular, we need to replicate on the testbed, for every link in the real world, a communication link whose received signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) matches the corresponding link signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). In this paper, we focus on the downlink SNR mapping associated with a network with a single access point (AP). Four indoor wireless propagation models (commercial buildings with/without line-of-sight path and residential buildings with/without line-of-sight path) and two types of spatial distributions (uniform distribution inside a circular cell and uniform distribution along a line) have been investigated.

Optical wireless (OW) communication offers vast unused spectrum and high area spectral efficiency. In this work, optical cells are envisioned as supplementary access points within heterogeneous RF/OW networks. These networks opportunistically offload traffic to optical cells while utilizing the RF cell for highly mobile devices and devices that lack a reliable OW connection. Visible light communication (VLC) is considered as a potential OW technology due to the increasing adoption of solid state lighting for indoor illumination. Results of this work focus on a full system view of RF/OW HetNets with three primary areas of analysis. First, the need for network densication beyond current RF small cell implementations is evaluated. A media independent model is developed and results are presented that provide motivation for the adoption of hyper dense small cells as complementary components within multi-tier networks. Next, the relationships between RF and OW constraints and link characterization parameters are evaluated in order to define methods for fair comparison when user-centric channel selection criteria are used. RF and OW noise and interference characterization techniques are compared and common OW characterization models are demonstrated to show errors in excess of 100 x <b>when</b> dominant <b>interferers</b> <b>are</b> present. Finally, dynamic characteristics of hyper dense OW networks are investigated in order to optimize traffic distribution from a network-centric perspective. A Kalman Filter model is presented to predict device motion for improved channel selection and a novel OW range expansion technique is presented that dynamically alters coverage regions of OW cells by 50 %. In addition to analytical results, the dissertation describes two tools that have been created for evaluation of RF/OW HetNets. A communication and lighting simulation toolkit has been developed for modeling and evaluation of environments with VLC-enabled luminaires. The toolkit enhances an iterative site based impulse response simulator model to utilize GPU acceleration and achieves 10 x speedup over the previous model. A software defined testbed for OW has also been proposed and applied. The testbed implements a VLC link and a heterogeneous RF/VLC connection that demonstrates the RF/OW HetNet concept as proof of concept...|$|R

40|$|SATCOM is a {{critical}} capability that is increasingly in demand among civilian and military users. The past several years have seen {{a dramatic increase in}} electronic warfare capabilities available to potential adversaries that will pose a significant threat to SATCOM systems. Additionally, the circuit oriented architecture of current SATCOM systems is ill-suited to support future traffic demands and a random multiple-access mode that can dynamically adapt to user traffic, as well as the number of users, will be required for future systems. Given that military operations often take place in contested environments, future systems must also be able to operate in the presence of complex and powerful interference platforms. This thesis proposes a combined system using the slotted ALOHA protocol as its random multiple access scheme along with direct sequence spread spectrum coding to provide channel robustness and low probability of detection. We estimate the transmission power achievable by a transportable interferer using commercially available technologies and develop limits on the maximum channel capacity achievable for different numbers of channels operating in the same frequency band. We show that the combined system can support a large number of channels operating at low data rates <b>when</b> the <b>interferer</b> <b>is</b> present, and higher data rates under benign circumstances. We also investigate the stability of the slotted ALOHA control algorithm under dynamically varying traffic loads and show that the system remains uncongested as long as the average traffic load is kept below the maximum throughput of the channel. The system is shown to be able to return to an uncongested state after periods of time where the traffic load exceeds the maximum throughput of the channel. Two methods for implementing dual-class service are developed and their effects on throughput and latency are discussed. Finally, we anticipate attack strategies an interferer may use to target the physical and media access control layers of the system and develop techniques for mitigating these attacks. A technique known as code switching is developed and shown to significantly improve the system's robustness to attacks targeting both the physical and media access control layers. by John T. Metzger.
