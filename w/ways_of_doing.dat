5|$|NHL 17, an {{ice hockey}} {{simulation}} video game, uses the Ignite engine, created by Electronic Arts. During a game, players maneuver around the ice with normal skating and deking {{and are able}} to seamlessly pass to teammates to create scoring chances. If a player scores a goal, they are able to celebrate the way they want to; many new celebrations were added to the game. One newly added celebration was a mimicked version of baseball player José Bautista's iconic bat flip that occurred during the 2015 American League Division Series. Defensively, the player can skate their way to the puck carrier and have a chance to break up the play. The player has multiple <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so; pushing the carrier off of the puck, delivering a body check, or pushing them towards the boards of the ice. If they wish, the player can enable the On-Ice Trainer, a system made to assist the player as they play. NHL 17 features game presentation {{in the style of the}} NHL on NBC, with commentary being provided by Mike Emrick (play-by-play), Eddie Olczyk (color) and Ray Ferraro (ice-side reporter), with the network's score bug appearing on-screen as well.|$|E

25|$|Business Process Reengineering (BPR) {{began as}} a private sector {{technique}} to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> work.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter {{introduced}} the economic theory of creative destruction, {{to describe the}} way in which old <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.|$|E
25|$|The fur trade benefited Indigenous {{people as}} well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier.

25|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} is a contemporary movement {{to establish the}} most effective algorithms of practice (<b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> things) {{through the use of}} systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The movement is facilitated by modern global information science, which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The Cochrane Collaboration leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.|$|E
25|$|In 1692, the Spanish, led by Don Diego de Vargas, reconquered New Mexico. This time colonizers {{were able}} to coexist with the Pueblo Indians. The Spanish {{established}} many communities in which Catholicism and the Spanish language combined with the culture and myths of the Pueblo Indians. New Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 and eventually achieved independent statehood in the United States of America in 1912. The mixed cultural influences and {{a long history of}} intermarriage among the Hispanos and the indigenous peoples (i.e.,the mestizaje) remained largely intact throughout rural New Mexico well into the 20th century. The colonization of New Mexico by Spanish colonists resulted, therefore, in a combination of indigenous myths with Catholicism. As the Hispano community's beliefs and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> things interacted with those of the Native Americans a cultural pattern where indigenous myth maintained importance alongside Catholic doctrine evolved.|$|E
25|$|Planned content {{begins with}} the creative/marketing team {{generating}} their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they send them off for approval. There is two general <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ {{depending on the size}} and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) to sign off or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public. Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department.|$|E

25|$|A serious {{difficulty}} arises if the variables are not {{measured in the}} same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the curve – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then {{it is clear that}} we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|E

As a further {{deterrent}} to Black's queenside expansion, White often moves the knight on f3 to c4 via d2. With the knight on c4, Black's ...b7-b5 break may be met by axb5 followed by Na5, when {{the arrival of a}} white knight on c6 could severely disrupt Black's position. The knight on c4 also attacks Black's backward pawn on d6, and White can often increase the pressure on this pawn by playing Bf4 or Nb5. The strength of White's knight on c4 often induces Black to exchange it off: typical <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so are ...Nb6, ...Ne5, or ...b7-b6 followed by ...Ba6.|$|E

500|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{wrote an}} opinion concurring in the judgment, {{in which he}} argued that {{content-based}} discrimination {{should be considered a}} [...] "rule of thumb, rather than as an automatic 'strict scrutiny' trigger, leading to almost certain legal condemnation".

[...] However, he also argued that [...] "virtually all government activities involve speech", and many involve content-based regulations on speech. Therefore, he concluded that a rule triggering strict scrutiny for all cases involving content-based restrictions would be a [...] "recipe for judicial management of ordinary government regulatory activity". Justice Breyer argued that instead of the automatic trigger, courts should determine the constitutionality of content-based regulations by [...] "examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the countervailing objectives, {{the extent to which the}} law will achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so". Although he did not believe strict scrutiny should be applied to the town's sign ordinance, he agreed that the town's ordinance was unconstitutional because the town did not provide a rational justification for treating some signs differently than other.|$|E
