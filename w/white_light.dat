5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into <b>white</b> <b>light</b> by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of <b>white</b> <b>light</b> owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} had two lights; {{the lower}} a fixed <b>white</b> <b>light</b> {{and the upper}} a quick flashing <b>white</b> <b>light,</b> showing every 60 seconds. However, this quick revolution gave the impression it was a fixed light with no flashes detectable. This {{may have contributed to}} the grounding, at Cefn Sidan, of the La Jeune Emma, bound from Martinique to Cherbourg in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Joséphine de Beauharnais.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white</b> <b>lighter</b> myth or <b>white</b> <b>lighter</b> curse is {{an urban}} legend {{based on the}} 27 Club of which several musicians and artists died while in {{possession}} of a <b>white</b> <b>lighter,</b> causing <b>white</b> lighters to be blamed for bad fortune. The myth is primarily based on the deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain. The myth has been integrated with cannabis culture.|$|R

5|$|The Essex Reef Light {{was first}} lit on July 1, 1889, it {{featured}} a fixed red light until December 15, 1892, {{when it was}} changed to a fixed <b>white</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when {{illuminated by}} blue or ultraviolet light, it re-emits it as green, and appears differently than under <b>white</b> <b>light</b> illumination. Biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable <b>white</b> <b>light.</b> Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium {{was found to be}} toxic.|$|E

5|$|Krypton's {{multiple}} emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear whitish, {{which in}} turn makes krypton-based bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant <b>white</b> <b>light</b> source. Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography. Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish-yellow light.|$|E

5|$|One {{advantage}} of this design was that the diodes created light around the same frequency as the laser glass' output, {{as compared to the}} <b>white</b> <b>light</b> flashtubes where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency of the laser glass. This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.|$|E
5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh <b>white</b> <b>light,</b> {{was achieved by}} constructing a long narrow set covered in aluminium foil, which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors. This shot was drained of color entirely, and was combined {{with a series of}} blurring and framing effects in post-production to further enhance the intended image—to create the impression of waking from a dream.|$|E
5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region.

When Martin spread his hands, the two-story-high LED lights erupt in a colour of rainbow hues. The LED background changes colours as the band continues. The video concludes its ending with the band lined up, one-by-one, and the LED set displaying a <b>white</b> <b>light</b> background.|$|E

5|$|HD 2039 is {{a stable}} G-type star, meaning it shines with <b>white</b> <b>light</b> {{that can be}} seen in the Sun. In terms of mass, the star {{exhibits}} almost identical properties. HD 2039 exhibits a radius approximately 40 percent larger than the Sun's. The star is slightly hotter than the Sun; while HD 2039 has a temperature of 5935 K, the Sun's surface temperature lies nearly 200 kelvins lower at 5778 K. HD 2039 is unusually metal-rich, which has attracted the attention of astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If <b>white</b> <b>light</b> is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.|$|E
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a <b>white</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the light}} had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens was {{installed}} in May 1902, just three months into its operation. The light characteristic was a fixed <b>white</b> <b>light</b> with a red flash every 15 seconds. In 1972, the light was automated and the Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern optic. The light continues {{to serve as an}} active aid to navigation. In 1987, a FA-251 was installed before the current lens, a VRB-25 was installed. The current light characteristic is an alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds. The white and red flashes can be seen for 18 nautical miles and 15 nautical miles, respectably.|$|E
50|$|Neverending <b>White</b> <b>Lights</b> is a Canadian music {{collaboration}} project fronted by Daniel Victor from Windsor, Ontario, and featuring several artists {{mainly from}} Canada and the United States. Daniel Victor performs all musical instruments, {{with most of}} his songs featuring guest singers. The idea behind Neverending <b>White</b> <b>Lights</b> is to present a sampling of different voices, styles, and artists, while retaining the 'focused' sound characteristic of a band.|$|R
5000|$|Low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps are {{extremely}} efficient. They produce a deep yellow-orange light {{and have an}} effective CRI of nearly zero; items viewed under their light appear monochromatic. This makes them particularly effective as photographic safelights. High-pressure sodium lamps tend to produce a much <b>whiter</b> <b>light,</b> but still with a characteristic orange-pink cast. New color-corrected versions producing a <b>whiter</b> <b>light</b> are now available, but some efficiency is sacrificed for the improved color.|$|R
