40|$|M. Com. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{consider}} the financial advice an estate agent should give the purchaser and seller of a house in order to allow the parties to have a clear understanding of the financial implications of the sale. Entering into an agreement of sale in respect of personal property, with specific reference to housing, has to be one of the biggest single investments of a person's life. Should a person make such a decision without having sufficient advice concerning the financial implications, making a mistake could have far-reaching results. That is why it is in the best interests of the country that both parties should receive comprehensive financial advice. Not all estate agents are able to provide professional financial advice to purchasers and sellers of houses. The main reason for this is insufficient agent training. In addition to this, agents are allowed to close deals between purchasers and sellers for <b>a</b> year before <b>writing</b> <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> according <b>to</b> law. Purchasers are generally uninformed about sale transactions and what is more, usually respond to advertisements encouraging them to purchase a home of their own at low monthly instalments. The hidden cost items are not always revealed to the parties to a sale agreement. An estate agent is not an "agent" in the true juridical sense of the word,because he cannot close a deal on behalf of his principal (who instructs him) ...|$|R
