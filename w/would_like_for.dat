He has a cruel manager named Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion) who is constantly taunting and demeaning Locke. At one point Locke tells Randy off and feels great about it.

25|$|Although Mass Effect: Andromeda was not {{designed}} with specific plans for future installments, BioWare's original intention was to continue adding to the series. However, following the game's disappointing commercial and critical reception, reports arose that BioWare Edmonton would be {{taking a break from}} the franchise to focus on their new IP, Anthem, and that BioWare Montreal would focus on other games under the Electronic Arts umbrella, such as Star Wars Battlefront II. In August 2017, BioWare Montreal was merged with EA's Motive Studios, casting further doubt {{on the future of the}} Mass Effect franchise. However, former series creative director Casey Hudson, who departed from BioWare in 2014 but returned following Mass Effect: Andromedas release, has stated that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> the series to continue.|$|E
