5|$|In January 2010, {{the band}} {{announced}} that they <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> short break after being {{on the road for}} the better part of six years. The break lasted for about a year-and-a-half, during which band members devoted themselves on solo projects, while the band made sporadic other contributions.|$|E

5|$|Initially, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center {{predicted}} that Matthew <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> more eastern track {{and hit the}} Florida Panhandle. Because the track shifted westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a Tropical Storm Warning from the Florida/Alabama border to Intracoastal City, Louisiana {{on the day before}} landfall.|$|E

5|$|On 8 March 2010, Wilders {{announced}} that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> seat on the Hague city council, after it became clear he won 13,000 preference votes. Earlier he had {{said he would not}} take up a seat if he won.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 2017, Meshuggah {{announced}} that Thordendal <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> leave from touring with the band; {{he will be}} temporarily replaced by Per Nillson from Scar Symmetry.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} she <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> nap {{for two hours}} in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette {{and go to bed}} at 10pm.|$|E

50|$|Writing {{the number}} <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> extreme amount of time: {{if a person}} can write two digits per second, then writing <b>a</b> googolplex <b>would</b> <b>take</b> about 1.51 years, which is about 1.1 times the {{accepted}} age of the universe.|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two cups of tea, and go to bed at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of issue 6 in August 2012, Vaughan announced that the series <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> two-month hiatus, after which the first six-issue story arc was published in trade paperback form in October for $9.99 before the series' return in November, a practice that Vaughan and Staples would continue after each successive story arc and trade paperback publication. That same month, Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con, their first appearance together since the series' debut. Some retailers refused to display the trade paperback because its cover (a reuse of the first issue's cover) depicts Alana breastfeeding Hazel.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic problem}} with this is that natural {{selection}} calls for the slow accumulation of changes, where <b>a</b> new phyla <b>would</b> <b>take</b> longer than <b>a</b> new class which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> longer than <b>a</b> new order, which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> longer than <b>a</b> new family, which <b>would</b> <b>take</b> longer than <b>a</b> new genus <b>would</b> <b>take</b> longer than {{emergence of a new}} species [...] but the apparent occurrence of high-level taxa without precedents is perhaps implying unusual evolutionary mechanisms.|$|R

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving {{and when he was}} out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} September 13, {{residents}} were made {{aware that a}} storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed the storm <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> more southerly course towards France. This forecast was later withdrawn as the storm failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland {{on the morning of}} September 16, hours before the brunt of the storm arrived. Fearing building collapses, officials in County Galway closed markets {{for the duration of the}} storm.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2011, RAG FAIR {{announced}} that they <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> indefinite dormancy period starting March 2011, concluding their performance career with a live tour named [...] "THAT'S RAG FAIR".|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2011 season, the Spartans posted an {{impressive}} 35-win season with only 26 losses, however, they <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> early exit from the Western Athletic Conference Tournament.|$|R
5|$|Favre {{was drafted}} by the Atlanta Falcons {{in the second round}} with the 33rd overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft. On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, US$1.4million {{contract}} with a reported signing bonus of $350,000. Atlanta head coach Jerry Glanville did not approve of the drafting of Favre, saying it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> plane crash for him to put Favre into the game. Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown in a game against the Washington Redskins. He only attempted four passes in his career at Atlanta, was intercepted twice, and completed none of them. Favre took one other snap, which resulted in a sack for an eleven-yard loss.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that HM Government <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> stake of up to 58% in the Royal Bank of Scotland in a move aimed at recapitalising the Group. HM Treasury subscribed for £5billion in preference shares and underwrote the issuance of £15bn of new ordinary shares offered to RBS shareholders and new institutional shareholders at the fixed price of 65.5p. As a consequence of the mismanagement which necessitated this rescue, the chief executive, Fred Goodwin (who secured the takeover of NatWest), offered his resignation, which was duly accepted. Chairman Sir Tom McKillop also confirmed he would stand down from that role when his contract expired in 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously chief executive of British Land.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Fox {{announced}} that, due {{to financial}} difficulties, {{they were unable}} to continue to produce The Simpsons under its current contract and that unless there were pay cuts, the show could end. For the negotiations, the studio requested that the cast members accept a 45% cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the last. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> pay cut of 30%, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut.|$|E
5000|$|On March 29, 2017, it was {{announced}} that Dave Rogers, the crew chief of the No. 19 team, <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> indefinite personal leave of absence, with Scott Graves replacing him.|$|R

5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to unseat Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a campaign issue. Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He said that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> new look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In {{the days after the}} vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a new look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen {{people were killed in}} Busan.|$|E
5|$|Later on in 2012, Feeder took on {{one last}} tour for the year. The tour lasted for five dates {{starting}} at the O2 Academy Glasgow, before ending at the Brixton Academy in November. At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for a while, before deciding what to do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website Mancunian Matters in which {{he told them that}} the band <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.|$|E
