5000|$|Baader Meinhof is a 1996 album by Luke Haines, {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} Baader Meinhof.

5000|$|Migrants are {{essential}} to the functioning of , but, at the same time, they are reviled for being [...] "dirty" [...] and a drain on government support systems - in other words, for being impoverished. [...] "The migrants are needed," [...] Steinbeck states, [...] "and they are hated." [...] A small child living in the [...] "squatter's camp" [...] agrees: [...] "When they need us they call us migrants, and when we've picked their crop, we're bums and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out." [...] The migrants, however, are desperate to get out of poverty. They want nothing more, Steinbeck asserts, than to become economically self-sufficient again: [...] "as they move wearily from harvest to harvest, there is one urge and one overwhelming need, to acquire a little land again, and to settle on it and stop their wandering." [...] They are wanderers not by choice, but because they have no other way to survive. Steinbeck continuously emphasizes the virtues and inherent dignity of these farmers, which serves to make their current destitution all the worse.|$|E
5000|$|On March 10, 2016 it was {{announced}} that Spence would fight former light welterweight titlist Chris Algieri (21-2, 8 KOs) at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on April 16, his biggest fight to date. The fight was scheduled for 10 rounds. In front of a pro Algieri 7,628 crowd, Spence became the first boxer to stop Algieri inside the distance. Spence did what Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan could not do before him. This was also a seventh straight knockout. After the bout Spence claimed he was the mandatory for Kell Brook's IBF World title saying [...] "Kell Brook knows what time it is. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in the ring and fight.". IBF later stated that Spence must have a final eliminator before he is declared mandatory challenger. The end came when Spence delivered a left hook to Algieri’s face. The hard shot sent Algieri straight to the canvas and referee Benjy Esteves didn’t hesitate to stop the fight. For the fight, Spence earned $225,000 whilst Algieri earned $325,000. CompuBox punch statistics showed that Spence landed 96 of 311 punches (31%), whereas Algieri landed 36 of 114 thrown (32%). The fight averaged 1.482 million viewers on NBC.|$|E

Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task.

60|$|<b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> {{the great}} purpose of manhood, a passionate unison in {{actively}} making a world. This {{is a real}} commingling of many. And in such a commingling we forfeit the individual. In the commingling of sex we are alone with one partner. It is an individual affair, there is no superior or inferior. But in the commingling of a passionate purpose, each individual sacredly abandons his individual. In the living faith of his soul, he surrenders his individuality to the great urge which is upon him. He may have to surrender his name, his fame, his fortune, his life, everything. But once a man, in the integrity of his own individual soul, believes, he surrenders his own individuality to his belief, and becomes one of a united body. He knows what he does. He makes the surrender honorably, in agreement with his own soul's deepest desire. But he surrenders, and remains responsible for the purity of his surrender.|$|R

Searching for {{information}} on the Internet became much easier when Google started delivering their service. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> the most important (probably) results {{on the top of the}} list. But more and more people realize the limitations of this solution: long list of results- so we never know if the ordering is really the most effective; polluting results ordering with advertisements, and last but not least, almost complete unawareness of meta-data, and what is more, semantics. The future Web, the one we build as we speak, is the web of highly interconnected meta-data (semantics) and information heavily contributed by the communities of users. Therefore we need more robust, and also more user friendly, solutions to information discovery and sharing. In this article we present notitio. us, a service that allows to aggregate metadata-rich information from various types of social semantic information sources, and provides interesting solutions to further information discovery, browsing, and sharing. ...|$|R
