Bunches should contain one type of flower. Large flowers are dried individually. The leaves stripped as soon as possible after picking. They retain moisture and slow down the drying process. <b>Wall</b> <b>hooks,</b> poles or wires are placed at least six inches from the ceiling.

In the feces are the gravid proglottids that house the T. pisiformis eggs that will eventually be released form the proglottid onto nearby vegetation. The eggs are then ingested by a rabbit or from {{any member of the}} Leporidae family. Once inside the rabbit's gut the larva or oncosphere phase will then penetrate into the intestinal wall until they reach the blood stream. When the worm reaches the liver the larva transforms into a cysticercus form. This cysticercus will stay in the liver for about two to four weeks, then move to the peritoneal cavity where it will wait for the definitive host to eat the rabbit. The definitive hosts are ether dogs or other members of the Canidae family. Once ingested the cysticercus finds its way into the intestine and attaches to the intestinal <b>wall</b> with <b>hooks</b> and suckers. After the worm has time to develop and grow in size, the gravid proglottids is released from the distal end of the parasite and passed in the feces to start a new cycle.|$|R

Result showed that 273 collection numbers of plant living species were collected from Mt. Galunggung, which consisted of 213 species, 143 genus and 72 families. Plant families which most collected were Moraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Arecaceae and Lauraceae respectively. In crater area was collected a lot of pioneer plant, such as dawola (Trema cannabina Lour.), paku tiang (Cyathea spp.), nangsi (Villebrunea rubescens (Blume) Blume), muncang cina (Ostodes paniculata Blume), mara (Macaranga tanarius (L.)

40|$|Aim: The {{roots of}} Potentilla fulgens <b>Wall.</b> ex <b>Hook.</b> (Rosaceae) {{have been used}} in the {{indigenous}} system of medicine in Northeast India to treat diarrhoea. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the safety and protective effects of P. fulgens root extract in experimentally induced diarrhoea in mice. Methods: The protective effects of P. fulgens root extract was investigated against experimentally induced diarrhoea in mice, using four experimental models, i. e. measurement of faecal output, castor oil model, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) enteropooling assay and gastrointestinal transit test. The safety assessment of root extract was done in mice on the basis of general signs and symptoms of toxicity, food water intake and mortality of animals following their treatment with various doses of extract (100 and ndash; 3200 mg/kg). In addition, the serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), cholesterol and total protein of experimental mice were also monitored to assess the toxicity of root extract. Results: In the safety assessment studies, P. fulgens root extract did not showed any visible signs of toxicity, but mortality was observed in a single animal at 3200 mg/kg dose of extract. The extract also did not showed any adverse effects on the studied serum parameters of experimental animals. In the antidiarrhoeal tests, administration of 800 mg/kg dose of extract to mice showed 50 % protection from diarrhoea evoked by castor oil. In addition, the extract also showed 29. 27 % reduction in PGE 2 -induced intestinal secretion as compared to 30. 31 % recorded for loperamide, a standard anti-diarrhoeal drug. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that P. fulgens root extract possesses significant anti-diarrhoeal properties. Therefore, the roots of this plant can be an effective traditional medicine for the protection from diarrhoea. [J Intercult Ethnopharmacol 2014; 3 (3. 000) : 103 - 108...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Seawalls are {{sheltering}} structures {{used for}} protecting the coastal regions against wave induced forces. Because of random nature of the wave behavior, application of physical models {{for the study of}} wave-structure interaction can be quite efficient. In the present research, physical models of thin flexible walls were constructed and tested in a wave flume subject to generated random waves. The water surface variations and the strains {{at the base of the}} wall were recorded using sensors; and the relationship between the strain and the wave height was obtained using the zero up-crossing method. The results indicate that the strain-wave height relationship is linear. Since the behavior of the wall is within the elastic region, the relationship between the strain and the flexural moment at the base of the <b>wall</b> follows the <b>Hook’s</b> Law; and accordingly the relationship between the wave height and flexural moment at the base of the wall was obtained.

Designing takes into account the design of the sealing and fastening hooks and adapt the design principles.
