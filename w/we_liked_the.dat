500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{one episode}} [...] "Death" [...] heavily {{influenced}} the film's screenplay. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around {{the parents of}} South Park protesting about Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, [...] "After about {{the first year of}} South Park, Paramount already wanted to make a South Park movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing." [...] During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as [...] "disastrous". As such, they figured the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical.|$|E
500|$|Evan Gutierrez from AllMusic {{considered}} the record's instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette to be [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "unassuming". Arjona experimented with prominent Latin sounds for Adentro, such as Mexican and Tejano music on [...] "Mojado", {{a duet with}} Mexican band Intocable about immigration. Ricky Muñoz, the vocalist of the group, said that the group met Arjona in Monterrey, {{and that they were}} in contact with Arjona through Carlos Cabral, one of Adentro producers, who had also worked with them formerly. Muñoz additionally reflected: [...] "We admire Arjona. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> song and then we recorded it [...] It is very cool that he invited us [...]" [...] "Adiós Melancolía" [...] is mainly composed as a bachata song with Colombian influences. [...] "No Te Cambio Por Nada" [...] is intermittently rock-dabbled. The lyrics of [...] "De Vez En Mes" [...] pertain to a woman's menstruation.|$|E

500|$|... "Death" [...] {{warns against}} such {{misplaced}} values and condemns {{the practice of}} censorship, as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like South Park or Terrance and Phillip. The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere. The plot of [...] "Death" [...] heavily influenced the screenplay Parker and Stone wrote for their 1999 film, [...] The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around the parents of South Park protesting Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, [...] "After about {{the first year of}} South Park, Paramount already wanted to make a South Park movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone {{through a lot of}} personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is just the best that it can be from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} two suicide falls, the {{miniature}} New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along {{the heights of}} the buildings. McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds, but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty. Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots {{would be more effective}} with a wide-angle lens. [...] "The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens, but as we tried a 14 mm lens, and then a 10 mm, <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> shots more and more." [...] However, the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the model city, leaving empty spaces with no buildings. In the end, extra buildings were created from putting the one-sided buildings together and placing them at the edges. Charles Durning's fall was shot conventionally, but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera, his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Gus {{installing}} a surveillance camera into the meth lab {{stemmed from the}} idea of Walter and Gus employing what Gilligan called [...] "brinkmanship and gamesmanship" [...] against each other after their falling {{out at the end of}} the third season. Gilligan commented: [...] "What's one way Gus can amp up the story there? How can he mess with Walt's head a little bit?" [...] The footage shown from the first-person perspective of the camera is actual footage from the real camera, including the numbers shown at the top and bottom of the screen. This is why that shot is shown in pillarbox and in lower quality than the rest of the episode, which was shot in 35 mm film. The episode features a subplot with Marie engaging in acts of kleptomania, which had been a major part of her character during the first season. Catlin said it was conceived early on that Marie would act this way while brainstorming the ideas for Marie coping with Hank's difficult recovery. Gilligan described Marie's acts of stealing as a respite for her: [...] "She's looking for another life, but she's not actively ready to leave her husband or anything like that. ... <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> quirkiness of it." [...] Betsy Brandt said [...] "Open House" [...] was her favorite episode of the season to shoot.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

500|$|Despite the film's {{failure to}} enjoy {{immediate}} success, Wiseau paid {{to keep the}} billboard up for over five years, {{at the cost of}} [...] a month. Its bizarre imagery and longevity led to it becoming a minor tourist attraction. When asked how he managed to afford to keep the billboard up for so long in such a prominent location, Wiseau responded: [...] "Well, <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> location, and <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> billboard. So <b>we</b> feel that people should see The Room. [...] we are selling DVDs, which are selling okay." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rude indeed as was {{my young}} {{presumption}} Mrs. Church had still her cultivated patience, even her pity, for it. “We’re very crude,” she blandly remarked, “and we’re proportionately indigestible.” And lest her own refined strictures should seem to savour {{of the vice}} she deprecated {{she went on to}} explain. “There are two classes of minds, you know—those that hold back and those that push forward. My daughter and I are not pushers; we move with the slow considerate steps to which a little dignity may still cling. <b>We</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old trodden paths; <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old old world.” ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{episode was}} met with high {{positive}} reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 8/10 and remarked that [...] "Overall, it was a fun episode, hurt only by the uninteresting filler of Lisa dealing with blonde stereotypes. But even that delivered its share of memorable quotes. If the past few episodes are any indication, this season may {{go out on a}} very high note." [...] TVFanatic.com gave the episode 4/5 and stated [...] "The Homer's backyard sequences felt reminiscent of the prior prohibition episode, but were still plenty of funny moments. While the actual plot was nothing too unique, <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> ending with Flanders realizing he was playing God and the whole camera-setup being set up as a reality show in England." ...|$|E
2500|$|In camp, {{soldiers}} of the regiment occupied themselves in various ways: [...] "we carried wood, water, cooked, washed our clothes, cleaned our guns, conversed, wrote letters to our people at home, tussled, ran foot races, jumped, boxed or jollied each other in friendly ways; some recruits loafed or layed around and grieved of home until sent off to the hospital or died in camp. Other jolly souls sang songs, especially at night; others played various games of chance: cards, dice, kino or other games. [...] We... fished in creeks or rivers or went in bathing, and some frequently attended religious services... Green bandsmen near us making discordant noise on their tin horns caused {{some of the boys}} to swear, though <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> music after they had learned to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Scott Rudin {{bought the}} film rights to McCarthy's novel and {{suggested}} an {{adaptation to the}} Coen brothers, {{who at the time}} were attempting to adapt the novel To the White Sea by James Dickey. By August 2005, the Coens agreed to write and direct the film, having identified with how it provided a sense of place and also how it played with genre conventions. Joel Coen said that the book's unconventional approach [...] "was familiar, congenial to us; we're naturally attracted to subverting genre. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> fact that the bad guys never really meet the good guys, that McCarthy did not follow through on formula expectations." [...] Ethan Coen explained that the [...] "pitiless quality" [...] was a [...] "hallmark of the book, which has an unforgiving landscape and characters but is also about finding some kind of beauty without being sentimental." [...] The adaptation was the second of McCarthy's work, following All the Pretty Horses in 2000.|$|E
6000|$|Brutal indeed my {{proposition}} was, and Mrs. Church was {{not prepared}} to assent to it in this rough shape. She dropped her eyes on her book, with an air of acute meditation. Then, raising them, [...] "We are very crude," [...] she softly observed--"we are very crude." [...] Lest even this delicately-uttered statement should seem to savour of the vice that she deprecated, she went on to explain. [...] "There are two classes of minds, you know--those that hold back, and those that push forward.

2500|$|The hits just {{inspired}} {{confidence in}} us. We became totally involved in getting dressed up {{and going out}} to gigs, the gigs and rehearsals were everything. Nothing worried us, we were so busy consuming what was happening around us. We were super aware, on top of every trend in music and clothes and language. We tried {{to be honest and}} sincere with our music, only playing and recording what <b>we</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>The</b> guys in the good record bars dug what we were doing and they got in all the latest English R records for us. We were listening to Zoot Money, John Mayall, Manfred Mann, The Animals, all that sort of stuff and trying to create that sound. We were different from groups like The Underdogs who just played 12-bar blues all night; we tried {{to be a lot more}} imaginative about what we did ... We had no idea what we were earning on tour, we just spent what we wanted and ploughed the rest back into the band. We had our way with girls, bought more clothes and equipment and just enjoyed being stars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{finished}} product was a 20-by-20inch oil {{painting of a}} man {{sitting in a chair}} in an all-white room with his back facing the audience. The cover chosen was the ninth one he painted for the project. Smith discussed the inspiration for the cover after he visited the band at their Maui recording studio. [...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our culture. Issues such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page. [...] "Is the whiteness purity and peace that he seeks, or the stark cold white of a mental ward? [...] "It's just a guy who has had enough, everything has gotten too heavy and he needs a break from it all. He hasn't given up or surrendered, just created an enlightened microcosm. The minimal white area surrounding the figure is more important than the figure itself, being that it can represent health or paranoia." [...] The image is repeated on the disc itself.|$|E
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it.
