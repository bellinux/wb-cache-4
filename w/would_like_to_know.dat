On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

25|$|Poirot is {{diverted}} {{to stay in}} an English village inn when his chauffeur-driven car breaks down. Although he doesn't appreciate the badly cooked meal he is served, he does enjoy relaxing {{in front of the}} fire in his room after his walk through the snow to reach the establishment. He is interrupted by the mechanic who is trying to repair the car. The young man – Ted Williamson – is impossibly handsome and well-built, like a Greek god, and Poirot is reminded of a shepherd in Arcady. Williamson knows of Poirot's reputation and asks him to trace a young girl who has disappeared. The previous June, Williamson was called out to a large house nearby called 'Grasslawn' to repair a broken radio. The house owners and their guests were out boating and he was shown in by the maid to a Russian ballet dancer who was staying there. The golden-haired maid was called Nita and Williamson fell for her. He went out for a walk with her and she said she would be back with her mistress in two weeks time and would see him again but when the time had come for their second meeting, the maid was different. The new maid, Marie Hellin, gave him an address in North London to write to contact Nita – but his letter came back unanswered. Poirot visits this address and was told the girl, an Italian, had returned to her home country. She is described by the landlady as dark-haired and bad-tempered, whereas the girl Williamson described was golden-haired. Poirot tries to trace Nita through her former employer, Katrina Samoushenka, but is told that the dancer has gone to Switzerland. He also speaks with the owner of 'Grasslawn', Sir George Sanderfield, who remembers Marie – with some unease – but doesn't recall a maid on the first occasion of Madame Samoushenka's visit to his house, and thinks Poirot is mistaken. Marie is the subject of Poirot's next visit. She was employed in the last week of June when the previous maid had left, possibly due to illness. She hints that she knows something of Sir George that Poirot <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> but the detective doesn't take up the offer, much to her annoyance.|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you, but feel I have no need to do so.

500|$|Nathaniel Cary, {{the second}} pathologist, {{objected to the}} CPS's decision. Cary told The Guardian that the push had caused a {{haemorrhage}} to Tomlinson's abdomen, and the haemorrhage caused him to collapse. Cary said Tomlinson was vulnerable to this because he had liver disease. The CPS had erred in dismissing a charge of actual bodily harm (ABH), in his view. In a letter to Tomlinson's family, the CPS described Tomlinson's injuries as [...] "relatively minor" [...] and therefore insufficient to support such a charge. But Cary told The Guardian: [...] "The injuries were not relatively minor. He sustained quite a large area of bruising. Such injuries are consistent with a baton strike, which could amount to ABH. It's extraordinary. If that's not ABH I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what is." ...|$|E
500|$|... "William Burroughs: Open Letter to Mr. Garden Mustain" [...] was {{originally}} published in the East Village Other on 7 July 1970. The East Village Other introduction to Burroughs' piece notes that the open letter [...] "is Mr. Burroughs' final answer to his critics and to Mister Gorden Mustain who attacked him for his position on Scientology {{in the pages of}} the L.A. FREE PRESS. In it he asks the inevitable question to be faced by us all, whether we be in a professional status or not: 'We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where Scientology and Mr. Hubbard stand on the Vietnam war, on sexual freedom, militant students, Black Power, pot, Red China, the politics of the American Narcotics department and the CIA. If it comes to a revolution: which side would you fight on?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} leaves it mysterious, early script drafts {{made clear that}} HAL's {{breakdown}} is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about {{the purpose of the}} mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel 2010). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is [...] "...something about this mission that we weren't told. Something {{the rest of the crew}} knows and that you know. We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether this is true", to which HAL responds: [...] "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know." [...] HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.|$|E

500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, she said to me that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E
500|$|The Palace Flophouse, where Mac, Hazel, {{and other}} locals reside, is a storage shed behind the Chinese store {{now owned by}} Joe the Mexican, and the Flophouse {{residents}} muse on their awkward path through life ("A Lopsided Bus"). Fauna comes by briefly to tell Hazel that she has run his [...] "horror scope" [...] {{and that he will}} one day be President. The Flophouse boys have a problem: Joe the Mexican acts unaware that he owns the shed; he has not appeared to either demand rent or to kick them out. They <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether Joe is aware of his ownership, without tipping him off. The boys come {{up with the idea of}} raffling off their shed, with the raffle rigged so that Doc, who would not kick them out, will be the winner. The prize money will allow Doc to buy the microscope he needs for his scientific work. They sound out Joe about the scheme; he offers to sell tickets in his store and displays no awareness that he owns the shed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, the trio {{returned}} to Norway where Asja subsequently left to live with an aunt in Nice and never returned. Although Quisling promised to provide for her well-being, his payments were irregular, and over the coming years he would miss a number of opportunities to visit. Back in Norway, and to his later embarrassment, Quisling found himself drawn into the communist Norwegian labour movement. Among other policies, he fruitlessly advocated a people's militia to protect the country against reactionary attacks, and asked members of the movement whether they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what information the General Staff had on them, but he got no response. Although this brief attachment to the extreme left seems unlikely given Quisling's later political direction, Dahl suggests that, following a conservative childhood, he was by this time [...] "unemployed and dispirited... deeply resentful of the General Staff... {{in the process of}} becoming politically more radical." [...] Dahl adds that Quisling's political views at this time could be summarised as [...] "a fusion of socialism and nationalism," [...] with definite sympathies for the Soviet regime in Russia.|$|E

2500|$|One {{thing that}} makes Petri nets {{interesting}} is that they provide a balance between modeling power and analyzability: many things one <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about concurrent systems can be automatically determined for Petri nets, although {{some of those things}} are very expensive to determine in the general case. [...] Several subclasses of Petri nets have been studied that can still model interesting classes of concurrent systems, while these problems become easier.|$|E
2500|$|Closing {{arguments}} {{were made on}} November 4, 2005. Upon completion of the closing arguments, Gillen asked Jones, [...] "By my reckoning, this is the 40th day since the trial began and tonight will be the 40th night, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if you did that on purpose." [...] (40 days and nights was {{the length of the}} Biblical Great Flood.) Jones responded, [...] "Mr. Gillen, that is an interesting coincidence, but it was not by design." [...] This humorous exchange provided the title for Matthew Chapman's book about the trial, 40 Days and 40 Nights.|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{continued}} plotting his [...] "Canary scheme", and on 11 May he told Fox [...] "My {{other friends}} most sincerely wish me there I plague them so with talking about tropical scenery [...] ". His father gave him [...] "a 200£ note" [...] {{to pay his}} college debts. In addition, [...] "Some goodnatured Cambridge man has made me a most magnificent anonymous present of a Microscope: did ever hear of such a delightful piece of luck? one <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who it was, just to feel obliged to him." [...] Darwin later found that the gift was from his friend John Herbert.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a debate}} with Farrell Till, Hovind said that Donald Johanson had {{uncovered}} the leg bones of Lucy {{at a different}} site over a mile away from the reported site, in a deeper stratum, quipping, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how fast the train was going that hit that chimpanzee." [...] This was clearly contrary to the published statements by Johanson. After Hovind had been informed in 1993 that his statement was false, he agreed to stop using the claim. When he repeated the claim in 1995, he once more agreed he was in error.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{results of}} the operation were disastrous for {{the image of the}} Air Corps. Speaker of the House Henry T. Rainey, echoing comments made by Gen. Billy Mitchell, criticized: [...] "If we are unfortunate enough to be drawn into another war, the Air Corps wouldn’t amount to much. If it is not equal to carrying the mail, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what it would do in carrying bombs." [...] Despite the public humiliation, the Air Mail Fiasco resulted in a number of improvements for the Air Corps, bringing about changes that its previous publicity campaigns were unable to obtain.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Robert A. Oden, {{formerly}} of Dartmouth College, taught that the Jahwist's creation story in [...] reflects {{that human beings}} are dissatisfied by our status as mortals, knowing less than we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> In the Jahwist's Genesis, this dissatisfaction repeatedly gets people into trouble, but the author still, in Oden's reading, finds this human trait admirable, the source of cultural advances. Oden taught that Judaism never read the story as Original Sin or the Fall of Man, but as just one more instance of human beings getting into trouble, and God rescuing them and giving them another chance.|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted however that even where we can fully model an instrument, because of benefit take-up issues, we <b>would</b> still <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the value and {{presence}} of the benefit so that take-up can be modelled; although many models assume 100 % take-up.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spatial {{statistics}} {{is concerned}} with statistical methods that explicitly analyses spatial arrangement of the data. When analyzing these kinds of data, we might be interested investigating the temporal data process that generated the data. Typically spatial point patterns are data that {{made up of the}} location of point events. We are interested in whether or not their relative locations represent a significant pattern. For example, seismologists have been showing the distribution of earthquakes in a region. They <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>known</b> if there is any pattern that might help them make predictions about future earthquakes. In this work, an investigation of earthquakes spatial data is analyzed, using specific statistical modeling techniques...|$|R
