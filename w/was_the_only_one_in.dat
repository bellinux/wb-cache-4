5|$|In 1928, {{an officer}} {{working at the}} station was sacked after it was {{revealed}} he had been gathering bribes from local nightclubs and brothels, acquiring over £17,000 (now £) in the process. The officer subsequently committed suicide and the station {{is believed to be}} haunted by his ghost. Related incidents include reports of papers being inexplicably moved, and an officer hearing footsteps despite knowing he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the station.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's death <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> presidential history {{not to be}} officially {{recognized}} in Washington, because of his allegiance to the Confederacy. He had requested a simple burial, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis devised a grand, politically pointed funeral, painting Tyler as a hero to the new nation. Accordingly, at his funeral, the coffin of the tenth president of the United States was draped with a Confederate flag; he remains the only U.S. president ever laid to rest under a foreign flag.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{crossed over the}} Florida panhandle and southeastern Georgia, the winds {{weakened}} to , although it still produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds in Savannah, Georgia. No severe damage {{was reported in the}} city. The tropical storm continued northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic and paralleling the coastlines of the Carolinas just offshore. Several ships reported strong winds and rough seas. On October6, the storm restrengthened to its peak intensity before becoming an extratropical cyclone about 200mi (320km) southeast of Cape Cod; however, one meteorologist assessed it as acquiring extratropical characteristics after it exited Georgia into the western Atlantic. As an extratropical storm, it reached winds of 80mph (130km/h), based on a ship report south of Atlantic Canada. Late on October7, the storm was last observed to the south of Newfoundland. The storm <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Hobson was {{inducted}} into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965, and Gale followed him into the Hall 12 years later. The entire 1938–39 Oregon team was enshrined in the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, and Anet, Dick, Gale, Hobson, Johansen, and Wintermute were inducted as individuals. The University of Oregon Athletic Hall of Fame selected the team and Hobson as part of its inaugural class of inductees in 1992. Dick and Gale (1993), Wintermute (1994), and Anet and Johansen (1996) were also inducted in later years. All five of the team's starters have had their numbers retired by the university.

5|$|Marshall {{insisted that}} Anvil {{required}} an experienced commander, and with Patton gone, Clark <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the theater. Then Devers received a cable that IV Corps headquarters {{was on its}} way to the theater. It was commanded by Major General Alexander Patch, who had a distinguished combat record leading the soldiers and marines of XIV Corps in the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific. With Marshall's concurrence, Devers appointed Patch to replace Patton as commander of the Seventh Army and Force 163 on 2 March. While Patch and his staff planned the operation, Devers ensured that the supplies accumulated for it were not dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Usain Bolt also {{competed in}} the men's 200meters race.

During the August 17 qualification round, Bolt {{competed in the}} fifth heat. He ran the race in 20.64seconds, placing second out of the nine athletes in his heat. Rondel Sorrillo of Trinidad and Tobago placed ahead of him (20.58seconds), while Belgium's Kristof Beyens placed behind him (20.69seconds). Out of 62 finishing athletes, Bolt tied Poland's Marcin Jedrusinski for 17th place. He advanced to the next round.|$|E

5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet {{in the solar system}} that could possibly support life, mainly because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
5|$|Edwin Thumboo, born in Singapore on 22 November 1933, was {{the eldest}} of eight {{children}} of a Tamil schoolteacher and a Teochew Chinese-Peranakan housewife from a Singaporean merchant family. He and his siblings grew up speaking English and Teochew. The family was financially comfortable; their home in Mandai <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the neighbourhood with electricity. Because of his mixed parentage, as a child he was sometimes called names and marginalized. This {{was said to have}} fostered determination and self-respect in him. He completed his primary education at Pasir Panjang Primary School in 1940. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore (1942–1945), he helped his family by selling cakes, tending goats, and working as a salesboy. Following the war, he studied at Monk's Hill Secondary School (finishing there in 1946) and Victoria School (1948). It was at the latter place that he began writing poetry at the age of 17 years, encouraged by the senior English master Shamus Frazer. Thumboo considers Frazer his spiritual father, and later dedicated Rib of Earth (1956), his first collection of poetry published while an undergraduate, to him. At this time, Thumboo was {{also a member of the}} Youth Poetry Circle, which counted among its members other early literary pioneers of Singapore such as Goh Sin Tub and Lim Thean Soo.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to allow a}} wrought iron {{suspension}} bridge to be built instead of stone, and tolls levied to recoup the cost. A company was formed and funds raised {{during the first few}} months of 1830, but the money raised was not sufficient for the construction. Despite this, the act received Royal Assent in May 1830. Brunel produced a new proposal costing £10,000 less than Telford's design and gained support for it in the local press. James Meadows Rendel, William Armstrong and William Hill also submitted new, cheaper proposals, complaining that the committee had not set a budget. In 1831 a second competition was held, with new judges including Davies Gilbert and John Seaward examining the engineering qualities of the proposals. Thirteen designs were submitted; Telford's <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which the chains achieved the weight per square inch required by the judges but it was rejected as being too expensive. The winner was declared to be a design by Smith and Hawkes of the Eagle Foundry in Birmingham. Brunel had a personal meeting with Gilbert and persuaded him to change the decision. The committee then declared Brunel the winner and he was awarded a contract as project engineer. The winning design was for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers. In 2010, newly discovered letters and documents revealed that, in producing his design, Brunel had taken advice from his father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The elder Brunel had recommended including a central support for the bridge, as he did not believe a single-span bridge of such length could be constructed. His son chose to ignore his advice.|$|E
