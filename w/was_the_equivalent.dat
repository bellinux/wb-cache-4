5|$|In February 1217, Louis {{set sail}} for France to gather reinforcements. In his absence, {{arguments}} broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's {{war against the}} rebels <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a religious crusade. This declaration resulted {{in a series of}} defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour. Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the Battle of Lincoln in May.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the Book of the Dead was known {{as early as the}} Middle Ages, well before its contents could be understood. Since it was found in tombs, it was evidently a document of a religious nature, and this led to the widespread misapprehension that the Book of the Dead <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a Bible or Qur'an.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meteorologist}} David Roth {{assessed the}} storm as making landfall on August19 at Isle Dernière {{to the west}} of New Orleans, a research paper from the American Meteorological Society estimated that the hurricane moved ashore about 40mi (60km) southeast of New Orleans. Modern research suggests the storm <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a major hurricane (a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale), or with winds of at least , when it made landfall. It passed just southwest of the city, becoming the closest major hurricane to New Orleans. The wind diameter was average to slightly below-average, and the forward speed was normal. Due to its movement, the hurricane likely maintained much of its strength after making landfall and by the time it affected New Orleans. The hurricane gradually weakened over land, passing near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi on August20. Heavy rainfall was reported in eastern Ohio beginning on August21, potentially from the remnants of the storm merging with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|Han society {{below the}} level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain {{privileges}} such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a marquess and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate (houguo 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, they were considered commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC so that all the kings' sons were made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a county Prefect.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century Ranulf Higden, a monk in Chester, {{described}} {{some of the}} Roman remains, {{including the}} sewers and tombstones. Antiquarians began to take interest in the remains in the 17th century and interest continued {{to grow in the}} 18th century, fed by accounts of Roman Chester and discoveries such as an altar to Jupiter Tanarus. Jupiter Tanarus– also Taranis– was the Romanised version of the god Taranis who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of Jupiter the god of thunder. In 1725, William Stukeley recorded the Roman arches of the east gate; they were demolished in 1768. Over the next century, accidental discoveries continued, such as parts of the Roman bath complex outside the fortress which were destroyed by a late-18th-century housing development.|$|E
5|$|The single cavalry {{division}} {{assigned to}} the BEF in 1914 consisted of 15 cavalry regiments in five brigades. They were armed with rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only armed with the shorter range carbine. The cavalry division also had a high allocation of artillery compared to foreign cavalry divisions, with 24 13-pounder guns organised into two brigades and two machine guns for each regiment. When dismounted, the cavalry division <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of two weakened infantry brigades with less artillery than the infantry division. By 1916, there were five cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, serving in France, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd divisions in the Cavalry Corps and the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions in the Indian Cavalry Corps, each brigade in the Indian cavalry corps contained a British cavalry regiment.|$|E
5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|E

5|$|The soldier's sole {{substantial}} {{disposable income}} {{came from the}} donativa, or cash bonuses handed out periodically by the emperors, as these were paid in gold solidi (which were never debased), or in pure silver. There was a regular donative of 5 solidi every five years of an Augustus reign (i.e. one solidus p.a.) Also, on the accession of a new Augustus, 5 solidi plus a pound of silver (worth 4 solidi, totaling 9 solidi) were paid. The 12 Augusti that ruled the West between 284 and 395 averaged about nine years per reign. Thus the accession donatives would have averaged about 1 solidus p.a. The late soldier's disposable income would thus have averaged at least 2 solidi per annum. It is also possible, but undocumented, that the accession bonus was paid for each Augustus and/or a bonus for each Caesar. The documented income of 2 solidi was {{only a quarter of}} the disposable income of a 2nd-century legionary (which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of c. 8 solidi). The late soldier's discharge package (which included a small plot of land) was also minuscule compared with a 2nd-century legionary's, worth just a tenth of the latter's.|$|E
