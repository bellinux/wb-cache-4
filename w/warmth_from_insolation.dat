40|$|Reconstructions {{of climate}} from marine sediment(1) and ice(2) cores {{show that the}} {{amplitude}} of glacial-interglacial climate cycles increased substantially after the Mid-Brunhes Event(3), about 430, 000 years ago. Interglacial periods before the event seem to be characterized by larger continental ice sheets, lower sea level(4, 5), cooler temperatures in Antarctica 2 and lower atmospheric CO 2 concentrations(6), relative to the more recent interglacials. Here we use an Earth system model of intermediate complexity to assess the contributions of insolation and greenhouse-gas concentrations to the climate associated with the peaks of all the interglacials over the past 800, 000 years. Our simulations recreate the expected warmer interglacials after the Mid-Brunhes Event and suggest that later interglacials are warmer primarily because of increased global mean temperatures during Northern Hemisphere winters. This <b>warmth</b> arises <b>from</b> increased <b>insolation</b> during this season, relative to the interglacials that preceded the Mid-Brunhes Event, in conjunction with increased atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations. The effect of boreal winters and of the Southern Hemisphere, which is also warmer during austral winters, on the carbon cyle should be assessed when investigating {{the underlying causes of}} the higher CO 2 concentrations during the later interglacials...|$|R

50|$|Insolation {{figures are}} used as an input to worksheets to size solar power systems. Because solar {{collectors}} panels are almost always mounted at an angle towards the sun, insolation must be adjusted to prevent estimates that are inaccurately low for winter and inaccurately high for summer. This also means {{that the amount of}} sun falling on a solar panel at high latitude is not as low compared to one at the equator as would appear <b>from</b> just considering <b>insolation</b> on a horizontal surface. In many countries the figures can be obtained <b>from</b> an <b>insolation</b> map or <b>from</b> <b>insolation</b> tables that reflect data over the prior 30-50 years. Photovoltaic panels are rated under standard conditions to determine the Wp rating (watts peak), which can then be used with insolation to determine the expected output, adjusted by factors such as tilt, tracking and shading (which can be included to create the installed Wp rating). <b>Insolation</b> values range <b>from</b> 800 to 950 kWh/(kWp·y) in Norway to up to 2,900 in Australia.|$|R
