5|$|Even after {{becoming}} a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal <b>writs,</b> witnessing six of Rufus' <b>writs</b> while bishop, {{to add to}} his 11 witnessed <b>writs</b> during his chancellorship. Bloet {{was one of the}} bishops in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to consult with the papacy. When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go, the king ordered him to leave the kingdom, with the support of most of the bishops and nobility.|$|E

The section receives approximately 10,000 <b>writs</b> for non-payment each month.|$|E
5|$|A crisis erupted {{over the}} <b>writs</b> of {{assistance}} on December 27, 1760, {{when the news}} of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All <b>writs</b> automatically expired {{six months after the}} death of the King, and would have had to be re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain valid.|$|E
25|$|The <b>writ</b> of coram nobis is {{an ancient}} <b>writ</b> that {{developed}} in sixteenth century England. The <b>writ</b> addresses errors discovered when the petitioner {{is no longer in}} custody and therefore cannot avail himself of the <b>writ</b> of habeas corpus. Granting such an extraordinary <b>writ</b> is reserved for the rarest of cases.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to purge Latin from the {{language}} of the law, California law has for many years used the term <b>writ</b> of mandate in place of <b>writ</b> of mandamus, and <b>writ</b> of review in place of <b>writ</b> of certiorari.|$|R
2500|$|In filing the {{petition}} {{in the trial}} court {{is a step in}} the criminal process; however, the <b>writ</b> of coram nobis should be treated as a civil <b>writ</b> for appeal purposes. [...] The <b>writ</b> is a discretionary <b>writ</b> and so a lower court's ruling on a petition for the <b>writ</b> is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard in the appellate court.|$|R
5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via <b>writs</b> of error from state courts, original <b>writs</b> of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{remedies}} of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and {{habeas corpus}} were originally only {{available to the}} British Crown and thus termed prerogative <b>writs,</b> that is, <b>writs</b> that could be issued at the prerogative of the sovereign. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, they could theoretically be sought by any aggrieved citizen. In 1938, the <b>writs</b> were abolished in the United Kingdom and replaced by prerogative orders with essentially the same names and functions. As a former British colony, Singapore inherited English administrative law at independence and the Singapore courts continue to pay close attention to English cases. In Singapore, the prerogative orders were known by their traditional names until 2006, when the names were modernized.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, <b>writs</b> of mandamus, <b>writs</b> quo warranto, <b>writs</b> of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
50|$|The ancient <b>writ</b> of coram nobis {{originated}} in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after {{the conclusion of a}} case, the <b>writ</b> could be issued by the court to correct the error. The <b>writ</b> of coram nobis was identical to the <b>writ</b> of habeas corpus; except, the <b>writ</b> of habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the <b>writ</b> of coram nobis was available to everyone else.|$|R
50|$|In his Commentaries, Blackstone {{noted that}} this common law <b>writ</b> would lie {{originally}} to prevent waste that took place between judgment in a real action and delivery of possession by the sheriff. Following the Statute of Gloucester, a <b>writ</b> of estrepement pendente placito would lie to prevent estrepement pending {{the outcome of a}} case. Either <b>writ</b> empowered the sheriff to prevent such waste, allowing him to imprison the waster, and even to raise a posse comitatus to assist him. According to Finlason, the basic <b>writ</b> of estrepement was an original <b>writ</b> that had to be sued out of chancery, whereas the <b>writ</b> pendente placito was a <b>writ</b> issued from the bench.|$|R
2500|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1800’s, the <b>writ</b> of coram nobis was {{recognized}} and utilized under the common law in Tennessee. [...] The <b>writ</b> was used primarily in civil cases — similar {{to the use of}} the <b>writ</b> in other states. The <b>writ</b> was also available in criminal actions in Tennessee, although rarely sought.|$|R

5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these <b>writs</b> would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the <b>writs</b> summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the <b>writs</b> were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E

50|$|A <b>writ</b> of {{prohibition}} is a <b>writ</b> directing a subordinate {{to stop doing}} something the law prohibits. In practice, the court directs the clerk to issue the <b>writ,</b> and directs the sheriff to serve it on the subordinate, and the clerk prepares the <b>writ</b> and gives it to the sheriff, who serves it. This <b>writ</b> is often issued by a superior court to the lower court asking it not to proceed with a case which does not fall under its jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|The title Baron Percy {{has been}} created {{several times in the}} Peerage of England. The first, soon after 1066, a feudal barony rather than a barony by <b>writ,</b> which {{continued}} in parallel with the later baronies by <b>writ,</b> until the abolition of feudal tenure by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. The second, created by <b>writ</b> in 1299, became extinct in 1517. The third, created by <b>writ</b> in 1557, became extinct in 1670. The present creation was in 1722, by <b>writ</b> of summons.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the pledge}} of silence, rumours of the {{incident}} began to circulate and were brought to Gordon-Cumming's attention. In an attempt to scotch the rumours, he demanded a retraction from five of the house party; when that was not forthcoming, with no withdrawal forthcoming, on 6 February 1891, Gordon-Cumming issued <b>writs</b> for slander against the five, claiming £5,000 against each of them.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 1988, the appellants unsuccessfully {{applied to}} the High Court for leave to apply for <b>writs</b> of habeas corpus. The appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal.

5|$|In the United States, Coke's {{decision}} {{met with}} a better reaction.

5|$|Prof. Freedman {{has argued}} that Bollman erred in {{applying}} § 14's proviso to both courts and individual judges (as opposed to only individual judges) and thus that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did confer federal courts the power to grant <b>writs</b> of habeas corpus to state prisoners. The Reconstruction-era Congress granted federal courts this power in 1867.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} <b>writs</b> {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit <b>writs</b> of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E
50|$|If {{it comes}} to light that a vacancy has not {{properly}} been declared, a <b>writ</b> for a by-election can be cancelled by a further <b>writ</b> of supersedeas.

5000|$|If a party {{wanted to}} contest the {{granting}} of a <b>writ</b> of prohibition, they could do so in two ways.

5000|$|By the 1970s, the {{majority}} of states had, {{in some form or}} another, replaced or eliminated the need for the <b>writ</b> of coram nobis when the state legislatures enacted statutes providing similar relief previously provided by the <b>writ.</b> [...] Today, this five-hundred year-old <b>writ</b> survives in only fourteen states courts, the District of Columbia courts, and US federal courts. The state courts authorized to issue the <b>writ</b> are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Virginia is the only state authorized to issue the “writ of coram vobis”, a <b>writ</b> identical in the United States to the <b>writ</b> of coram nobis, but different in its English origin.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect, Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed, {{in a report}} to the House of Representatives, a {{criminal}} appeal similar to that in England: a writ of error as of right in non-capital cases, and no <b>writs</b> of error in capital cases. Randolph's report was referred to the Committee of the Whole, which took no action.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court had other, limited {{sources of}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The Court could hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and mandamus, as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the Court had jurisdiction to hear <b>writs</b> of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative <b>writs</b> as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of criminal {{appeals to the}} Supreme Court by means of <b>writs</b> of error from the circuit courts was perhaps an open question prior to More. In England, the writ of error was available as of right in misdemeanor cases, but, in felony cases, required the express consent of the prosecutor.|$|E
