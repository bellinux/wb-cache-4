40|$|Process Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop an efficient <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> to remove cutting oil from machining part surface. The proposed <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> consists of two processes: the dipping process and the modified automatic ultrasonic washing process. The automatic ultrasonic washing process is redesigned and developed to reduce operating cost and increase productivity from the previously developed machine. For this proposed system, experiments have been performed to determine the washing conditions that yield satisfactory proportion of defectives due to oil contamination. Under the suggested operating conditions, the proportion of defectives due to oil contamination is reduced from 12. 8 % to 1. 78 %, which leads to $ 16, 800 defective cost reduction. The proposed <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> yields 42. 9 % increase in washing productivity. Furthermore, it as has more standard procedure than the current washing process...|$|R

50|$|Continuous motion pot <b>washing</b> <b>systems</b> are, in {{the most}} basic form, three {{compartment}} sinks with an agitating wash compartment. Most commonly used in the food service industry, the term continuous motion pot <b>washing</b> describes <b>washing</b> <b>systems</b> {{that do not have}} a set wash cycle (aka: cycle-less) or require an attendant. Unlike old three compartment sink systems where an employee was tied to a machine for hours scrubbing dirty ware, continuous motion pot <b>washing</b> <b>systems</b> allow employees to drop any number or type of pots and pans in the system and walk away. Later any employee can come by and move ware items to other compartments of the system. These systems are called “continuous motion” because they never stop working. When the machine is turned on, they are always running and always washing. The motion created is a very turbulent agitation created by a flow of continuous fluid movement powered by a motorized system.|$|R

The main sub-systems of mobile decontamination system are: pre-wash, chemical wash and post <b>wash</b> <b>systems</b> respectively. The pre-wash system consists of a 3000-litre stainless steel water tank and a fast suction pump. A high-pressure jet with a capacity of 3400 l/hour and a low-pressure jet with a capacity of 900 l/hour and 1600 l/hour are included. The chemical <b>wash</b> <b>system</b> is capable of mixing two powders and two liquids with variable feed rates and has a five-litre per minute slurry emulsion flow rate. The post <b>wash</b> <b>system</b> consists of a high-pressure hot water jet, a hot water shower for personnel and provision of steam for decontamination of clothing. The decontamination systems have been introduced into the services. The system is under production for the Army at DRDO's partnering firms, with the DRDO itself manufacturing the pilot batch.|$|R

Baylis developed a fixed grid system which consisted of pipes with nozzles that injected jets of water into the filter material during expansion. Rotating arms use jets of water to break up the clogged filter surface and to rotate a movable arm through the filter material. A surface wash step in a backwash cycle usually takes place at the beginning of the filter bed cleaning process.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Online {{compressor}} washing is {{an advanced}} method to recover power losses caused by compressor blade fouling without incurring the availability penalty of having {{to shut down the}} gas turbine engine. Liquid is sprayed into the compressor at full or near full load to wash off particulates accumulated on the compressor surfaces. In particular, the cleaning of the first stage is vital to reinstate the mass flow of the engine, and a uniform fluid distribution is desirable in order to cover the full annulus. To achieve this, <b>washing</b> <b>systems</b> are generally developed empirically. Owing to the variety of intake duct geometries and gas turbine engines, the design of <b>washing</b> <b>systems</b> is generally related to individual power plants. To illustrate the trends of the main influencing parameters, a numerical investigation has been undertaken, based on an application case of a <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> installed in a heavy-duty gas turbine. The parameters studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were airflow reduction, injection location and direction, droplet mass, and injection velocity. The effectiveness of the <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> was evaluated from the fluid distribution at the compressor inlet plane. It has been shown that, depending on the spray nozzle location, different optimum droplet sizes and injec-tion velocities are required. Consequently, the application of different nozzle types is advisable. The operating condition of the engine has a significant effect on the fluid distribution at the compressor inlet and therefore changes in engine mass flow have to be considered when deciding on a washing scheme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this analysis, the {{economics}} of MBI International’s three-phase surfactant <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> {{for the removal of}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from sediment was optimized. The system, which consists of a screw washer, an oil/water separator, and a vacuum filter, transfers PCBs to a sacrificial oil layer through two individual two-phase partitioning steps. At the completion of the washing process, the sacrificial oil layer is incinerated. Cleaned soil is disposed of in a municipal solid waste facility, and the spent surfactant layer is recycled. The <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> was modeled using the MATLAB mathematical program and an economical analysis was conducted using the results from the program. When connecting-equipment between operating units, product maintenance, and capital depreciation are considered, the economic results were reported with a 35 % confidence level. According to the cost analysis, the manufacturing cost to treat 20 tons of sediment per hour was determined to be approximately 15 million dollars. This cost includes the usage of 6 % (by volume) surfactant in the aqueous phase and 375 kilograms of sacrificial oil. The net profit was calculated to be approximately 56 thousand dollars. The three-phase surfactant <b>washing</b> <b>system</b> is technically feasible and sound. It is recommended that a pilot plant investigation be initiated for the patentpending process...|$|R
