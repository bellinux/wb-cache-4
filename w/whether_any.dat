5|$|In other jurisdictions, {{courts have}} applied {{standards}} {{of judicial review}} more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional. It {{remains to be seen}} <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> of these approaches will be adopted locally.|$|E
5|$|After the Constitution of May 3, 1791, sejms {{were to be}} {{held every}} two years and last 70 days, with a {{provision}} for an extension to 100 days. Provisions for extraordinary sejms were made, {{as well as for}} a special constitutional sejm, which was to meet and discuss <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> revisions to the constitution were needed (that one was to deliberate every 25 years).|$|E

5|$|In May 1944, {{production}} wound down. 78 Ju 87s {{were built}} in May and 69 rebuilt from damaged machines. In the next six months, 438 Ju 87 Ds and Gs {{were added to the}} Ju 87 force as new or repaired aircraft. It is unknown <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> Ju 87s were built from parts unofficially after December 1944 and the end of production.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, it was {{reported}} that the U.S. Justice Department has launched a formal investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Hsu and his associates. One focal point for the investigation concerns <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> of the donations by the Paws were reimbursed by Hsu, which would constitute a felony. Through his attorney, Hsu has denied any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Many of the regnal {{dates of}} the East Anglian kings are {{considered}} unreliable, often being based upon computations. Some dates have presented particular problems for scholars: for instance, during the three-year-long period of apostasy {{that followed the}} murder of Eorpwald, {{when it is not}} known <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> king ruled the East Angles. The main source of information about the early history of the kingdom's rulers is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People.|$|E

5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{show that}} there is a 0.41 probability that the moon Halimede collided with Nereid at some time in the past. Although it is not known <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> collision has taken place, both moons appear to have similar ("grey") colors, implying that Halimede could be a fragment of Nereid.|$|E
5|$|The board did not {{investigate}} <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> USAF institutional factors, {{such as a}} lack of crew {{resource management}} training for the involved aircrews, might have been a factor. Also, the board did not attempt to determine if Wickson and May had violated any of the existing OPC rules of engagement as defined by the ATO or other written instructions.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the underlying cause and <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%. Admission to {{the intensive care unit}} is associated with a mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{domestic}} violence case between Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} American entertainer Chris Brown, media speculated as to <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> song featured on her fourth upcoming album would be about him. In an interview with MTV News, Ne-Yo clarified {{that he would not}} write a song for Rihanna about Brown, because he considered the idea unnecessary. Harmony said that no matter what song Rihanna released as a lead single from the album, it would be looked at as a song about Brown.|$|E
5|$|Gambling {{and related}} paraphernalia, broadly defined by ABC to include claw and crane machines, casino-themed video games, {{football}} pools, and door prizes, irrespective of <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> profit {{is being made}} by the business, are prohibited at licensed establishments. The only exceptions are for those bars licensed {{by the state to}} sell lottery tickets or have off-track betting on horse racing. Charity bingo games or raffles are also allowed. Card games, darts, billiards and other games are permitted as long as no money is exchanged, and no prizes are given.|$|E

5|$|On 19 May 1995, Pellerin {{pleaded guilty}} at a USAF court-martial {{proceeding}} to {{two counts of}} dereliction of duty for his actions, or lack thereof, {{that contributed to the}} crash. He was sentenced to forfeit $1,500 of salary a month for five months and received a written reprimand. The USAF did not reveal <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> other officer involved in the chain of events leading to the crash received any type of administrative or disciplinary action. Critics of USAF's safety record stated that this crash was an example of a pattern of problems related to enforcement of safety procedures within USAF.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2012, American {{officials}} {{claimed that}} they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253. American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, {{and would have been}} deployed near the anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commentators}} questioned {{what time}} the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad {{arrived at the}} hospital; why {{there seemed to be}} little blood on the ground where they were shot; and <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists a few {{units of}} presumably light {{infantry}} with names denoting specialist function: superventores and praeventores ("interceptors") exculcatores ("trackers"), exploratores ("scouts"). At the same time, Ammianus describes light-armed troops with various terms: velites, leves armaturae, exculcatores, expediti. It is unclear from the context <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> {{of these were}} independent units, specialist sub-units, or indeed just detachments of ordinary troops specially armed for a particular operation. The Notitia evidence implies that, {{at least in some}} cases, Ammianus could be referring to independent units.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of curium, {{as well as}} americium, in 1944 was {{closely related to the}} Manhattan Project, so the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the Quiz Kids, five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on November 11, 1945, when one of the listeners asked <b>whether</b> <b>any</b> new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. The {{discovery of}} curium (242Cm and 240Cm), their production and compounds were later patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.|$|E
