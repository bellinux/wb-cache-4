500|$|Far Side Virtual mainly designates a {{space in}} society, or a mode of behaving. All of these things {{operating}} in synchronicity: like ringtones, flat-screens, theater, cuisine, fashion, sushi. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "virtual reality," [...] so I call it Far Side Virtual. If {{you really want to}} understand Far Side, first off, listen to [...] Debussy, and secondly, go into a frozen yogurt shop. Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just fool around, hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If you do all these things you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E
500|$|Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson {{spent the}} summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to {{complete}} the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he {{could do a lot}} of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult." ...|$|E

500|$|According to a 2009 {{article in}} The New York Times, Tolle is [...] "not {{identified}} with any religion, but uses teachings from Zen Buddhism, Sufism, Hinduism and the Bible". He has said: [...] "I feel actually {{that the work}} I do is a coming together of the teaching 'stream', if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that, of [...] Krishnamurti and Ramana Maharshi." [...] Tolle has mentioned texts such as the Tao Te Ching, the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures, the Buddhist scriptures, the Old Testament, the New Testament, and A Course in Miracles; he has mentioned various individuals such as Zoroaster, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Jesus, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Rumi, Meister Eckhart, Hafiz, Rinzai Gigen, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Gustav Jung; and he has emphasized the mystical schools within religions such as Gnosticism in Christianity, Sufism in Islam, Hasidism and Kabbala in Judaism, Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, and Zen and Dzogchen in Buddhism.|$|E
500|$|Costa's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} was in 1956, with his trio featuring bassist Vinnie Burke and drummer Nick Stabulas. This was released under slightly differing titles by Josie Records and Jubilee Records, and was well received: critic John S. Wilson, for instance, {{commented on the}} [...] "roaring, spitting piano solos by Eddie Costa". Around this time, Costa was nicknamed [...] "The Bear" [...] by Burke for his powerful playing. Also in 1956, Costa and Burke joined guitarist Tal Farlow, forming a resident trio {{to play at the}} Composer, a club on West 58th Street in New York. Farlow's comment on the absence of a drummer from the trio was that [...] "Eddie's feeding, comping or whatever you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> was so fierce that there was no doubt at all where the time was, so I didn't miss the drums at all". The trio stayed together, recording several albums under Farlow's name, until, in 1958, the Composer closed. Costa was often in recording studios as a sideman around this time: he appeared on approximately 20 albums in both 1956 and 1957. These included small group settings with Herbie Mann, Oscar Pettiford, and Phil Woods, and accompanying vocalists such as Tony Bennett and Chris Connor.|$|E
500|$|A deluxe edition {{included}} a DVD with a making-of {{feature of the}} recording process, {{as well as a}} track-by-track commentary by the band. The iTunes edition included [...] "Long Time Comin'" [...] and the music video for [...] "Sink into Me" [...] as bonus tracks. In promoting the album, Warner Bros. Senior Vice-President of Marketing Rob Gordon said the promotional campaign would accomplish two objectives: [...] "No. 1 is energizing the fan base. No. 2 is taking this band from the world of ... whatever you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> to an arena-rock band," [...] such as the Foo Fighters. To help with the first point, the label worked with Myspace to hold listening sessions aboard the band's tour bus in various cities. The album's release was followed by a European tour in July. [...] "New Again" [...] was released as a single on July 24 with an acoustic version of [...] "Sink into Me" [...] as the B-side. In late July and early August, the band toured the UK with support from Twin Atlantic. In August and September, the band supported Blink-182 on their North American tour and performed at Virgin Mobile FreeFest. [...] "Where My Mouth Is" [...] was released to radio on September 1. In late October, the band went on a brief tour of the US.|$|E
5000|$|On August 1, 1911, {{the first}} Rodeo {{was held at}} the {{racetrack}} grounds. It was advertised as a Wild West Show.

500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E
500|$|Teri VanHorn of MTV {{said that}} with [...] "Her body newly toned and her smile beaming, she looked every bit like {{a woman who had}} emerged from her quarter-life crisis {{stronger}} than yesterday." [...] She also said Spears performed with [...] "a naughty, free-spirited attitude", as though she [...] "had invited 900 friends to her dirty little dance party, and too bad for you if you couldn't roll with the fun." [...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

Blum writes that his colleagues tried to persuade him not to use such descriptive terms, that a less visual name would be easier, politically speaking. Gene Sackett of the University of Washington in Seattle, one of Harlow's doctoral students {{who went on to}} conduct additional deprivation studies, said, [...] "He first <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a dungeon of despair.

2500|$|Early {{reviews for}} The Tree of Life at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival were polarized. After being met with both boos and applause at its premiere at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, the film {{received}} mixed early reviews. The film {{went on to}} be awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or. Two of the film's producers, Bill Pohlad and Sarah Green, accepted the prize {{on behalf of the}} reclusive Malick. The Tree of Life is the first American film to win the Palme d'Or since Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004. The head of the jury, Robert De Niro, said it was difficult to choose a winner, but The Tree of Life [...] "ultimately fit the bill". De Niro explained, [...] "It had the size, the importance, the intention, whatever you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> that seemed to fit the prize." ...|$|E
2500|$|By May 1996, Sound on Sound was {{reporting}} that {{the popularity of the}} 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as [...] "the dance floor drum machine to use." [...] This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. Sound on Sound reported that the 909 was selling for between £900 and £1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about £700 to £800. Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on eBay. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May [...] "there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno, or whatever you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> There never has been. It was down to the preferences of a few guys. The 808 was our preference. We were using Yamaha drum machines, different percussion machines, whatever." ...|$|E

60|$|That is {{the reason}} why you should always be sure that a story you repeat is a good story.

6000|$|When I came to myself, {{the first}} thing I thought was that they would ask me to hold it. Then I remembered, with another sinking at the heart, that they might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> after me. These, of course, were selfish reflections; but my {{position}} was a trying one. The question was, what was the proper {{thing for me to}} do? I told myself that my brother might come back at any moment, and all I thought of after that was what I should say to him. I had an idea that I ought to congratulate him, but it seemed a brutal thing to do. I had not made up my mind when I heard him coming down. He was laughing and joking in what seemed to me a flippant kind of way, considering the circumstances. When his hand touched the door I snatched at my book and read as hard as I could. He was swaggering a little as he entered, but the swagger went out of him as soon as his eye fell on me. I fancy he had come down to tell me, and now {{he did not know how}} to begin. He walked up and down the room restlessly, looking at me as he walked the one way, while I looked at him as he walked the other way. At length he sat down again and took up his book. He did not try to smoke. The silence was something terrible; nothing was to be heard but an occasional cinder falling from the grate. This lasted, I should say, for twenty minutes, and then he closed his book and flung it on the table. I saw that the game was up, and closed [...] "Anne Judge, Spinster." [...] Then he said, with affected jocularity: [...] "Well, young man, do you know that you are an uncle?" [...] There was silence again, for I was still trying to think out some appropriate remark. After a time I said, in a weak voice. [...] "Boy or girl?" [...] "Girl," [...] he answered. Then I thought hard again, and all at once remembered something. [...] "Both doing well?" [...] I whispered. [...] "Yes," [...] he said sternly. I felt that something great was expected of me, but I could not jump up and wring his hand. I was an uncle. I stretched out my arm toward the cigar-box, and firmly lighted my first cigar.|$|E
