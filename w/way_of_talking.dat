In total ten interviews were included in an analysis <b>of</b> different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about the social situations experienced by people with such a psychiatric diagnosis. The main methods employed were semi-structured interviews utilised for the collection of research data and discourse analysis utilised {{for the analysis of}} this interview data. The main findings were as follows. Firstly, {{it was found that the}}re are empirically observable <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about being a person with a psychiatric diagnosis and social reactions towards this possession of a psychiatric diagnosis (both by the incumbents and broader society). Secondly, in a methodological context, it was found that these different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> were used interchangeably by the research participants depending upon the social context they used to describe their social situations. Thirdly, it was found that the impact <b>of</b> these different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> could be empirically demonstrated to impact upon the incumbent person?s agency (or more specifically, that person?s talk about what they are able (and unable) to do. Fourthly, the study identifies (and empirically validates) the impact <b>of</b> these different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about action on the social stigmatisation of people with a psychiatric diagnosis. Finally, the thesis addresses the roles of different mental health social movement organisations in relation to these social processes of stigma...|$|R

500|$|The pair had to {{overcome}} the challenge of how to represent [...] Thai speech and music. [...] Rodgers, who had experimented with Asian music in his short-lived 1928 musical with Lorenz Hart titled Chee-chee, {{did not wish to}} use actual Thai music, which American audiences might not find accessible. [...] Instead, he gave his music an exotic flavor, using open fifths and chords in unusual keys, in ways pleasant to Western ears. Hammerstein faced {{the problem of how to}} represent Thai speech; he and Rodgers chose to convey it by musical sounds, made by the orchestra. [...] For the King's style of speech, Hammerstein developed an abrupt, emphatic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking,</b> which was mostly free of articles, as are many East Asian languages. [...] The forceful style reflected the King's personality and was maintained even when he sang, especially in his one solo, [...] "A Puzzlement". [...] Many of the King's lines, including his first utterance, [...] "Who? Who? Who?", and much of the initial scene between him and Anna, are drawn from Landon's version. [...] Nevertheless, the King is presented more sympathetically in the musical than in the novel or the 1946 film, as the musical omits the torture and burning at the stake of Lady Tuptim and her partner.|$|E

Saavedra was the president, and Moreno was a secretary with the support of other vocal members. Ignacio Núñez describes how Morenists felt that the President was attempting to restore in his office the authority of the viceroys, thus downgrading the importance of {{the other members of the}} Junta at public events; while Saavedrists considered that the Secretary was overstepping his authority and did not allow even the appointment of a janitor that was not of his liking. However, Domingo Matheu would clarify in his memoirs that their initial concerns with Saavedra were based more on his desire for honours and privileges than for a real power struggle. Núñez described how Moreno was resisted by some criollos who initially supported the revolution without being aware of the long-term consequences. He was resisted by criollos alarmed by his straightforward <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about concepts like self-determination, tyranny, slavery, and freedom.

The vocals for the track were recorded through a guitar fuzz-box in order to distort them. [...] "I Palindrome I", is the final single that was released to promote Apollo 18. [...] The circular nature of the song's lyrical themes is reinforced by its title and use of palindromes. In fact, the song is notable for featuring a word-by-word palindrome in one of the verses: [...] "'Son, I am able', she said, 'though you scare me.' 'Watch', said I. 'Beloved", I said, 'watch me scare you, though.' Said she, 'Able am I, son.'" [...] "She's Actual Size" [...] was written by Flansburgh after he contemplated the imagery of someone viewing a departing person in a mirror; he felt that the symbolism was a [...] "really succinct <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about leaving somebody behind". The band later expressed disappointment with the [...] "definitive" [...] version featured on this album, largely because the song continued to develop as the band played it live. Flansburgh called the album version [...] "timid" [...] and noted that [...] "later performance versions of [...] have so much more spirit than the recorded version." [...] Although Linnell and Flansburgh usually write songs individually, [...] "My Evil Twin" [...] was an example of the two collaborating. Linnell wrote the musical structure of the song, rendering it as a MIDI file, and Flansburgh then wrote the melody and the lyrics.

Thus, studies with this view have focused on understanding the productive conceptual, meta-representational, linguistic, experiential, and epistemological resources that students have for advancing their understanding of scientific ideas (Clement et al. 1989; Moje et al. 2004; Scott 1998). In this view, everyday <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> are not seen as barriers but rather are considered as “anchoring conceptions” or “bridging analogies” to assist students in developing their understanding <b>of</b> scientific <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing (Clement et al. 1989; DiSessa et al. 1991).

[...] He was not only wealthy, but displayed suitable personal virtues and character traits. [...] The term was coined in 1861 by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. [...] The Brahmin had high expectations to meet: to cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leader. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against [...] "avarice" [...] and insisted upon [...] "personal responsibility." [...] Scandal and divorce were unacceptable.

2500|$|Williams {{developed}} {{the concept of}} co-inherence and gave rare consideration to the theology of romantic love. Falling in love for Williams {{was a form of}} mystical envisioning in which one saw the beloved as he or she was seen through the eyes of God. Co-inherence was a term used in Patristics theology to describe the relationship between the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ, and the relationship between the persons of the blessed Trinity. Williams extended the term to include the ideal relationship between the individual parts of God's creation, including human beings. It is our mutual indwelling: Christ in us and we in Christ, interdependent. [...] It is also the web of interrelationships, social and economic and ecological, by which the social fabric and the natural world function. But especially for Williams, co-inherence is a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about the Body of Christ and the communion of saints. For Williams, salvation was not a solitary affair: [...] "The thread of the love of God was strong enough to save you and all the others, but not strong enough to save you alone." [...] He proposed an order, the Companions of the Co-inherence, who would practice substitution and exchange, living in love-in-God, truly bearing one another's burdens, being willing to sacrifice and to forgive, living from and for one another in Christ. According to Gunnar Urang, co-inherence is the focus of all Williams's novels.|$|E

He wanted to cast unknown actors due to his [...] "phobia of stars", but after considering that he might not make another film, he asked Emmanuelle Devos, Irene Jacob and Valeria Golino to appear in the film and they all accepted.

Three days before the beginning of principal photography, Lacoste broke his knee at a music concert, and so his resulting limp was added to the character. According to Sattouf, Lacoste and Sonigo were completely at ease with filming scenes of masturbation, and all of the actors treated their French kisses [...] "like a hug".|$|E
