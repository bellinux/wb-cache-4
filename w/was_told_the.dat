5|$|At 20:00, Churchill, who had {{returned}} to 10 Downing Street, was awoken. He received bad news from the navy. In the Atlantic sinking of shipping had been bad, but his Secretary informed him that all had been redeemed in the day's air battle. He <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> RAF had downed 183 enemy aircraft for under 40 losses.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 pm, {{the crowd}} became violent after an {{individual}} threw a bottle off a roof {{into the crowd}} aggregated about the hospital. The group dispersed into gangs containing between 50–100 members. The gangs first broke windows of white businesses as they traveled through Harlem: if the mob <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> business was owned by blacks, they left it alone. If it was owned by whites, the store would be looted and vandalized. Rioters broke streetlights and threw white mannequins onto the ground. In grocery stores, the rioters took war-scarce items, such as coffee and sugar; clothing, and liquor; and furniture stores were also looted. Estimates put the total monetary damage between $250,000–$5,000,000, which included 1,485 stores burglarized and 4,495 windows broken.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1972, {{while driving}} {{home from a}} session of work on his injured {{shoulder}} with the Stoke physiotherapist, Banks lost control of his new Ford Consul (a re-badged Ford Granada Mk 1) car, which {{ended up in a}} ditch. He had attempted to overtake a car on a sharp bend and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van. He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of his right eye, and <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. His sight never returned, and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Zanna and Cooper {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which individuals were made to write a counter-attitudinal essay. They were divided into either a low choice or a high choice condition. They were also given a placebo; they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> placebo would induce either tension, relaxation, or exert no effect. Under low choice, all participants exhibited no attitude change, which would be predicted by both cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory. Interestingly, under high choice, participants who <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> placebo would produce tension exhibited no attitude change, and participants who <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> placebo would produce relaxation demonstrated larger attitude change.|$|R

5|$|When World War II broke out, Shaw took a {{break from}} acting and joined the Royal Air Force. He was {{commissioned}} as an Acting-Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 {{and over the next}} three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation, then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in the service and <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> only chance he would have to fly would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.|$|E
5|$|In Berks County, {{snow and}} sleet along with very cold {{temperatures}} combined with some accidents {{and other aspects}} to cause a 50-mile backup on Interstate 78. Many motorists, including more than 100 trucks, were stuck on the interstate for nearly 24 hours, without food, water and running out of fuel. At 12:26 PM on the 14th, a caller tells a 911 center he???s been stuck in traffic on westbound Interstate 78 near the Berks-Lehigh county line {{for more than an}} hour. At 1:02 PM, a truck driver tells the Berks Communications Center about a seven-mile backup on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 78 near Hamburg. At 4:40 PM, a 911 caller asked to speak to the Berks Emergency Management Agency. The Berks Deputy Coordinator took the call. At 4:59 PM, The Berks Deputy Coordinator called the State Emergency Operations Center and <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> center learned of the backup at 4:33 PM. At 5:22 PM, Berks Emergency Management calls the state police at the Hamburg barracks but cannot get through, so he decided to drive there. At 6:08 PM, the Berks Emergency Management Deputy Coordinator finds that the Hamburg barracks is without power and phones. At 6:27 PM, a senior decision-maker from PennDOT is requested to arrive at the Hamburg state police barracks to help with communications. At 9:30 PM, a PennDOT supervisor arrived in Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Murphy was lent to MGM at {{a salary}} of $25,000 {{to appear in the}} 1951 The Red Badge of Courage {{directed}} by John Huston and adapted from the Stephen Crane novel. At the urging of Spec McClure and celebrity columnist Hedda Hopper, over the misgivings of producer Gottfried Reinhardt and studio executives Louis B. Mayer and Dore Schary, director Huston cast Murphy in the lead of The Youth (Henry Fleming in the novel). The preview screening audiences were not enthusiastic, causing Schary to re-edit Huston's work, eliminating several scenes and adding narration by James Whitmore. MGM trimmed advertising efforts on what they believed was an unprofitable film. What eventually hit the theaters was not a commercial success, and it was also not the film both Murphy and Huston believed they had made. Murphy unsuccessfully tried to buy the rights to the film in 1955 in an attempt to re-edit and re-release it. Huston tried to buy it in 1957, but <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> original negative of what he had filmed was destroyed.|$|E

25|$|On 4 May 1877, Courbet <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> {{estimated}} cost of reconstructing the Vendôme Column; 323,091 francs and 68 centimes. He was given the option paying the fine in yearly installments of 10,000 francs for the next 33 years, until his 91st birthday. On 31 December 1877, a day before the first installment was due, Courbet died, aged 58, in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, of a liver disease aggravated by heavy drinking.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Bogdanovich resurfaced with The Cat's Meow. Returning {{once again}} to a {{reworking}} of the past, this time the supposed murder of director Thomas Ince by Orson Welles's bête noire William Randolph Hearst, The Cat's Meow was a modest critical success but made little money at the box office. Bogdanovich says he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> story of the alleged Ince murder by Welles, who in turn said he heard it from writer Charles Lederer.|$|E

25|$|Borussia Dortmund, on {{the other}} hand, were {{struggling}} to gain ground in their second consecutive season in the Bundesliga after promotion in 1976. Three games previously, the club had secured their Bundesliga status for the following year with a 2–0 away win over FC Schalke 04. Horst Bertram, Dortmund's number one goalkeeper, had just recovered from injury, but Dortmund's coach Otto Rehhagel decided to start with second-choice goalie Peter Endrulat, giving {{him a chance to}} present himself.

However, both the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on the matter on December 6, 1982, stated that Quebec had never held such veto powers.|$|E

25|$|After both contestants {{played a}} {{question}} of their own, each separately played a speed round of Super Match-style questions called Match-Up with a celebrity partner {{of his or her}} choice. The contestant was presented with a question with two possible answers and secretly selected one, after which the panelist <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> choices and then tried to match the contestant's choice by giving a verbal response. Each contestant had 30 seconds to make as many matches as possible as $50 per match, and game play began with the trailing contestant, who chose from any of the six panelists. The leading player chose from the remaining five panelists for their Match-Up round.|$|E
25|$|Soler {{would later}} {{claim that it}} <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> real reason for the refusal to allow transshipping was that Mitsubishi and Chrysler had divided their territories, informally agreeing that the former brand would have {{preference}} outside the mainland U.S. while Chrysler maintained it domestically. The dealership then began to suspect that Mitsubishi intended to sabotage its business in order {{to replace it with}} a wholly owned subsidiary once the brand had been established in Puerto Rico. Early in 1982 Soler stopped paying storage costs for the vehicles in Japan, claiming it had disowned them. Later that year the franchise agreement either ended or was terminated.|$|E

25|$|In 312 AD, Emperor Constantine {{visited the}} region where his orator {{described}} the turmoil that the region endures in cultivating vine. While {{the quality of the}} wine was the envy of the empire, the emperor <b>was</b> <b>told,</b> <b>the</b> vines can only be planted on a narrow patch of land between marshy plains and infertile rocky hilltops where winter frost often devastate the crops. Taking the wine down from the côte in fragile wood barrels was a treacherous ordeal along the potholed filled roads of the region, with many barrels being broken and lost along the way. The orator also described a scene of tangled old vines and knotted roots dotted along the vineyard, a likely sign that the ancient Burgundians practiced the vine propagation method of provignage or layering.|$|E
25|$|Simonson, who {{had been}} writing the team comic The Avengers, had gotten {{approval}} for Reed and Sue to join that team after Engelhart had written them out of Fantastic Four. Yet by The Avengers #300, where they were scheduled to join the team, Simonson <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> characters were returning to Fantastic Four. This led to Simonson quitting The Avengers after that issue. Shortly afterward, he was offered the job of writing Fantastic Four. Having already prepared a number of stories involving the Avengers with Reed and Sue in the lineup, he then rewrote these for Fantastic Four. Simonson later recalled that working on Fantastic Four allowed him the latitude to use original Avengers members Thor and Iron Man, {{which he had been}} precluded from using in The Avengers.|$|E
25|$|Oskar McNamara (who played Danny Latimer) was {{the third}} actor to be told who the murderer was. Danny Latimer's death is very violent, which {{required}} telling McNamara about the killer's identity several days in advance so that the actor could prepare and the scene could be choreographed and rehearsed. McNamara's parents worked closely with director Strong to ensure their son's physical and emotional safety. The mother of Adam Wilson (who played Tom Miller) <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> killer's identity several days before {{the release of the}} final three scripts. She declined to tell her son who the murderer was. Wilson learned that his on-screen father was the killer just a few minutes before the scene was shot.
