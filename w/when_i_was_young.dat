When questioned on how the idea behind the film had come to him, the director revealed, [...] "The seeds of all my movies were sown <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> long before I started making movies.

Let's put it this way: there were times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When I grow up / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot of stuff that you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> and I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't know of a little kid who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E
500|$|Between 1991 and 1997, Colón {{attended}} the Jesuit Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, {{from which he}} graduated. Unsatisfied with his physical conditioning, he began attending a gym as an 11-year-old. Despite this, Colón has stated {{that he did not}} intend to become a wrestler at first and only did so for exercise. It was not until completing his college education that he decided to train, after noticing that his condition was on par with the wrestlers despite his age. However, despite this Colón initially expected to retire within ten years and run a private business. He admits that during this initial stage, he received peer pressure to match the accomplishments of his father. Colón's decision to sign with World Wrestling Entertainment was a controversial one among the Puerto Rican wrestling community. He was criticized by the locals, labeled as someone who had [...] "sold out" [...] his Puerto Rican wrestling traditions over for the [...] "flash and flair" [...] of the American company. Colón spoke of this in an interview with The Sun in which he stated [...] "I did not care about what they thought. I've always dreamed of working for the WWE <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> and I took that chance when it came".|$|E
500|$|Marquez was a [...] "committed Leftist" [...] {{throughout}} his life, adhering to socialist beliefs. In 1991, Marquez published Changing the History of Africa an admiring study of Cuban {{activities in the}} Angolan Civil War and the larger South African Border War. Marquez maintained a close but [...] "nuanced" [...] friendship with Fidel Castro, praising {{the achievements of the}} Cuban Revolution, but criticizing aspects of governance and working to [...] "soften (the) roughest edges" [...] of the country. García Márquez's political and ideological views were shaped by his grandfather's stories. In an interview, García Márquez told his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, [...] "my grandfather the Colonel was a Liberal. My political ideas probably came from him to begin with because, instead of telling me fairy tales <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> he would regale me with horrifying accounts of the last civil war that free-thinkers and anti-clerics waged against the Conservative government." [...] This influenced his political views and his literary technique so that [...] "in the same way that his writing career initially took shape in conscious opposition to the Colombian literary status quo, García Márquez's socialist and anti-imperialist views are in principled opposition to the global status quo dominated by the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|The Florida Territorial Council {{passed laws}} forbidding interracial {{marriage}} {{and the right of}} free blacks or mixed race descendants to inherit property. To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed its [...] "spirit of intolerant prejudice", Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few slaves to Haiti, by that time free black republic. [...] His two daughters had already each married white planters and remained in Florida. He sold the plantation to his nephew, Kingsley Beatty Gibbs in 1839, and transferred some of the slaves to his plantation in San Jose, now a neighborhood in Jacksonville. Kingsley started a plantation in Haiti that was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become indentured servants; slavery was not allowed in Haiti. [...] They were to earn their freedom in nine years. In 1842 Kingsley gave an interview to the abolitionist Lydia Child. When she asked him if he was aware that his occupation as a slave trader might be perceived as being akin to piracy, he responded [...] "Yes; and I am glad of it. They will look upon a slaveholder just so, by and by. Slave trading was a very respectable business <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young.</b> The first merchants in England and America were engaged in it.

He was arrested for driving under the influence in 1999. Attempts at drug rehabilitation were unsuccessful, and he resorted to resolve his addiction via quitting cold turkey and exercise.
