40|$|We study Maxwell's {{equations}} {{in random}} media with small fluctuations {{of the electric}} permittivity. We consider a setup where the waves propagate toward a preferred direction, called range. We decompose the electromagnetic wave field in transverse electric and transverse magnetic plane waves, called modes, with random amplitudes that model cumulative scattering effects in the medium. Their evolution in range is described by a coupled system of stochastic differential equations driven by the random fluctuations of the electric permittivity. We analyze the solution of this system with the Markov limit theorem and obtain a detailed asymptotic characterization of the electromagnetic wave field in the long range limit. In particular, we quantify the loss of coherence of the waves due to scattering by calculating the range scales (scattering mean free paths) on which the mean amplitudes of the modes decay. We also quantify the energy exchange between the modes, and consequently the loss of polarization induced by scattering, by analyzing the <b>Wigner</b> transform (<b>energy</b> density) of the electromagnetic wave field. This analysis involves the derivation of transport equations with polarization.

Accumulation of energy in irradiated graphite has been recorded as high as 2.7 kJ/g, but is typically much lower than this.

40|$|<b>Wigner</b> <b>Energy</b> was {{determined}} by DSC analysis in cored graphite from the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. Eight segments (4 -inch long slugs) of cores were obtained from BGRR for analysis of <b>Wigner</b> <b>Energy</b> retained in the graphite. Graphite was scraped from each end of each slug giving two samples from each specimen. Between 10 and 20 mg of this graphite powder were weighed into platinum analysis cells and subjected to thermal analysis on a Shimadzu Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC- 50). The samples were annealed in nitrogen up to 700 C at a scan rate of 20 C/minute with data recorded at one second intervals. Each sample was run twice; the first scan provided the energy profile of the ''as received'' material and the second scan provided the background energy profile of the specimen, as the <b>Wigner</b> <b>Energy</b> had been removed during the first annealing. An example is shown in Figure 1. The blank was subtracted from the initial scan to give the <b>Wigner</b> <b>energy</b> profile. The appendix contains two graphs for each sample. One graph presents the data in J/s/g and shows {{the results of the}} two scans described above; the energy measurement of the ''as received'' and the same sample after annealing. The other graph presents the data in J/g/K, which was calculated by subtracting the background scan data from the first scan and dividing by the heating rate. The heating rate was nominally 20 K /minute (0. 333 K/s), however regression analysis provided a more accurate heating rate of 0. 3506 K/s and this was used to determine J/g/K. These values were plotted against temperature in C. From these plots the temperature at which energy release increases can be determined. The data (J/s/g) were summed providing a measure of total <b>Wigner</b> <b>energy</b> in the sample in Joules per gram. The DSC analysis gives energy content of the graphite that ranges from around 0 (actual measurements of samples from Loc 4 slug 3 were - 2. 9 and - 21. 2 J/g) to 212 J/g. Table 1 gives the location and the total energy content of each sample. Figure 2 contains background subtracted scans showing two groups of peak energy release rates. The group with the greatest release rates peaks between 250 and 260 C. These samples, with the greatest amount of stored energy, reached their maximum release rate within about 100 C of the start of release; peaking at about 1 J/g/K at analysis temperatures of 255 C. The other group had much slower approaches to their maximum release rates and only reached it between 300 and 350 C. Almost all samples began to show energy release at about 150 C. Below this temperature very little if any energy was released. A sample of reactor graphite that had not been irradiated had a similar temperature profile to the background (annealed) samples (not shown). Comparing four samples that show high energy deposition in Figure 3, the temperature at the initial release of energy is similar (about 150 C) and the peak heights for maximum energy release are also similar. There are differences in total energy release (e. g. 13 A slugs 9 a and b are 211 and 123 J/g respectively) which is the result of higher energy in the later portion of the scan; from about 300 C to 700 C.
