40|$|One {{strategy}} for isolating neuronal L-type calcium (Ca(2 +)) currents, which typically comprise {{a minority of}} the <b>whole</b> cell <b>current</b> in neurons, has been to use pharmacological agents that increase channel activity. This study examines the effects of the benzoyl pyrrole FPL 64176 (FPL) on L-type Ca(2 +) currents and compares them to those of the dihydropyridine (+) - 202 - 791. At micromolar concentrations, both agonists increased <b>whole</b> cell <b>current</b> amplitude in PC 12 cells. However, FPL also significantly slowed the rate of activation and elicited a longer-lasting slow component of the tail current compared to (+) - 202 - 791. In single channel cell-attached patch recordings, FPL increased open probability, first latency, mean closed time and mean open time more than (+) - 202 - 791, with no difference in unitary conductance. These gating differences suggest that, compared to (+) - 202 - 791, FPL decreases transition rates between open and closed conformations. Where examined, the actions of FPL and (+) - 202 - 791 on <b>whole</b> cell L-type <b>currents</b> in sympathetic neurons appeared similar to those in PC 12 cells. In contrast to its effects on L-type current, 10 microM FPL inhibited the majority of the <b>whole</b> cell <b>current</b> in HEK cells expressing a recombinant N-type Ca(2 +) channel, raising caution concerning the use of FPL as a selective L-type Ca(2 +) channel agonist in neurons...|$|R

40|$|The {{modulation}} of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> and of glutamatergic synaptic transmission by purified Evans Blue (EB) {{was investigated}} in rat cultured postnatal hippocampal neurones by use of patch clamp recordings and a fast drug application system. Three different groups of neurones could be distinguished {{with respect to the}} type of modulation obtained with 10 [*]μM EB: EB was either a predominant inhibitor of desensitization (13 % of the neurones), a predominant inhibitor of current amplitudes (42 %) or a mixed inhibitor of both properties (45 %). Both effects were not use-dependent and reached maximal levels after 30 [*]s of pre-equilibration with the diazo dye. Dose-response curves obtained from glutamate activated <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> yielded an IC 50 value for EB of 13. 3 [*]μM (Hill coefficient: 1. 3) for the inhibition of desensitization, and an IC 50 value of 10. 7 [*]μM (Hill coefficient: 1. 2) for the inhibition of current amplitudes. Chicago acid SS (100 [*]μM) {{which is one of the}} synthesis precursors of EB had no effect on current amplitudes of glutamate activated <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> but was a weak inhibitor of desensitization in all hippocampal neurones investigated, irrespective of the type of modulation obtained with EB in the same neurone. Oxidatively modified EB (the so-called VIMP (10 [*]μM)) had no effect on the kinetics but was a partial inhibitor of glutamate-activated <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> in all hippocampal neurones investigated. EB (10 [*]μM) inhibited the amplitudes of non-NMDA receptor mediated autaptic currents to the same extent (to 39 ± 19 % of control) as observed for glutamate activated <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> (to 41 ± 17 % and 56 ± 20 %). However, the decay of the autaptic responses remained uninfluenced upon EB application, indicating that either receptor desensitization does not dominate the time course of the synaptic response or that the non-NMDA receptors sensitive to modulation of desensitization by EB are not present in the postsynaptic membrane. In conclusion, EB differentially modulates α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor gating in different subsets of neurones. Upon identification of the cellular determinants for the differential modulation (e. g. AMPA receptor subunit composition) EB could become a useful tool to investigate receptor subtypes during electrophysiological recordings...|$|R

40|$|The flow of Ca ions through single Ca {{channels}} {{has been}} examined. The gigaseal method was used on identifiable snail neurons that were voltage clamped using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp method. Average Ca patch <b>currents</b> and <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> have similar time courses. They are affected similarly {{by changes in}} temperature. The differences in amplitude and inactivation between Ba and Ca <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> {{were present in the}} patch records. The stationary noise spectra recorded from ensembles of multichannel patches have two components with fast and slow time constants equivalent to two components in the <b>whole</b> cell tail <b>current</b> relaxations. Elementary current amplitudes measured from the variance-mean relationship and from noise spectra gave values comparable to measurements from single channels. The single channel I-V relationship was curvilinear and the maximum slope conductance in 40 mM Cao was 7 pS. The amplitude of unitary currents was unchanged at long times when inactivation had occurred; hence depletion is not involved in this process. Channel density was approximately 3 microns- 2 and was the same for Ba and Ca <b>currents.</b> The <b>whole</b> cell asymmetry <b>currents</b> gave very large values for the gating charge per channel. Changes in temperature from 29 to 9 degrees C had only a slight effect on the two Ca tail current tau's at potentials where turn-on of patch and <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> was markedly slowed and the peak amplitudes were reduced by one-third. Single channel recordings were obtained at these two temperatures, and the mean open time and the fast component of the closed times were scarcely affected. Unit amplitudes were reduced by 30 % and the slow closed time component was doubled. Therefore, peak currents and the slow closed time component was doubled. Therefore, peak currents were reduced {{partly as a result of}} the reduction in unit amplitude, but mainly as a result of a reduction in opening probability, the latter arising from an increase of the long closed times. It is concluded that the behavior of single Ca channels in membrane patches is the same as it is in whole cells. Cooling from 29 to 9 degrees C acts primarily on transitions among closed states and has little effect on the open to closed transition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEpilepsy, {{a common}} {{neurological}} disorder, {{is characterized by}} the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent epileptiform discharges (SREDs). Acquired epilepsy is associated with long-term neuronal plasticity changes in the hippocampus resulting in the expression of spontaneous recurrent seizures. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate and characterize endogenous epileptiform activity in hippocampal–entorhinal cortical (HEC) slices from epileptic animals. This study employed HEC slices isolated from a large series of control and epileptic animals to evaluate and compare the presence, degree and localization of endogenous SREDs using extracellular and <b>whole</b> cell <b>current</b> clamp recordings. Animals were made epileptic using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Extracellular field potentials were recorded simultaneously from areas CA 1, CA 3, dentate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex and <b>whole</b> cell <b>current</b> clamp recordings were obtained from CA 3 neurons. All regions from epileptic HEC slices (n= 53) expressed SREDs, with an average frequency of 1. 3 Hz. In contrast, control slices (n= 24) did not manifest any SREDs. Epileptic HEC slices demonstrated slow and fast firing patterns of SREDs. <b>Whole</b> cell <b>current</b> clamp recordings from epileptic HEC slices showed that CA 3 neurons exhibited paroxysmal depolarizing shifts associated with these SREDs. To our knowledge this is the first significant demonstration of endogenous SREDs in a large series of HEC slices from epileptic animals in comparison to controls. Epileptiform discharges were found to propagate around hippocampal circuits. HEC slices from epileptic animals that manifest SREDs provide a novel model to study in vitro seizure activity in tissue prepared from epileptic animals...|$|R

Averaged single channel and <b>whole</b> cell <b>currents</b> were similar when scaled and showed both fast and slow rates of inactivation. The inactivation and activation gating shifted quickly to hyperpolarized potentials for channels in cell-attached as well as excised patches, whereas a much slower shift occurred in whole cells.
