5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You <b>Were</b> <b>Here,</b> Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material.

Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You <b>Were</b> <b>Here</b> (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983).

5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they <b>were</b> <b>here</b> to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E

Ass was originally recorded with Badfinger producing, but the group later admitted they were incapable of producing themselves. Members Pete Ham and Tom Evans solicited Thomas' help in cleaning up existing recordings and laying down new tracks. Although the succeeding album Badfinger retained Thomas from the outset and was considered by critics to be an improvement in production, neither album was successful in the marketplace. For their third project together, Thomas held a meeting with the group and pleaded that they all concentrate on making the best record they could muster. It turned out that Wish You <b>Were</b> <b>Here</b> garnered the most positive critical response from periodicals, including Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E
