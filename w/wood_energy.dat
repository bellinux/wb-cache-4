As sources for <b>energy</b> production, <b>wood</b> from thinnings, logging residues, non-industrial round wood and residues from sawmilling are considered. The costs for <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> procurement are also calculated. Available <b>energy</b> <b>wood,</b> {{based on the}} 2004 actual cut, if collected, is approximately 4 million m 3. Nearly 86 % of it is non-industrial round wood and felling residues in cutting areas (56 %) and central processing yards (30 %), the rest (14 %) are by-products from sawmilling. The deciduous tree species (birch and aspen) dominate and are valued at 65 % of {{the total amount of}} felling residiues and non-industrial wood. It is possible to intensify utilisation of forest resources and thereby also to increase the use of <b>wood</b> in <b>energy</b> production. The total amount could be 54 % higher if the allowable cut could be utilised completely and 124 % higher if thinnings could also be utilised completely. There are, however, big differences within the region, as the current rate of utilisation of forest resources varies in the region. Currently, pre-commercial thinning is an economically unfeasible source of <b>energy</b> <b>wood.</b> Despite well developed technologies, the high costs of the pre-commercial thinning make supply of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> unprofitable. Commercial thinnings are economically more attractive as sources of <b>energy</b> <b>wood.</b> However, a choice of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> procurement chain for the 1 st commercial thinning is limited by cost factors. There are more possibilities for <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> supply from the 2 nd commercial thinning. The most cost-efficient supply chain based on a harvester and a forwarder allows a profitable <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> supply from a distance of up to 150 km. Currently, at final felling areas non-industrial wood is an economically feasible resource for energy production. The same applies to the availability of process residues at central processing yards and sawmills, where lump wood and slabs are the most cost-efficient resources for wood chip production and at present these sources of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> look very attractive.

40|$|Biomass or <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> {{harvesting}} can {{be integrated}} with conventional log harvesting (saw log or pulpwood production) to allow more cost-effective <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> supply. The efficiency of an integrated <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> harvesting system was evaluated and compared with conventional log harvesting in a 32 -year-old Pinus radiata plantation (radiata pine) located in south-west Western Australia. The harvesting system consisted of a harvester and a forwarder. The study included two treatments: a conventional log-harvesting operation where merchantable sawlogs and pulp logs were produced at the stump by the harvester and extracted by the forwarder; and an integrated <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> operation where the harvester produced sawlogs, pulp logs and <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> at the stump that were extracted by the forwarder. In the integrated <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> harvesting plot, 37 m 3 ha- 1 of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> was extracted {{in addition to the}} sawlog and pulp log volumes. Extracting the additional <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> reduced the productivity of the forwarder and increased the cost of extraction (AU$ 2. 7 m- 3) compared with the control plot (AU$ 2. 2 m- 3). Harvesting system cost was not significantly impacted, with a cost of AU$ 3. 18 m- 3 in the control plot and AU$ 3. 23 m- 3 in the integrated <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> harvesting plot. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was a significant factor influencing the working time of the harvester, whereas load volume, extraction distance and extraction type (sawlog, pulp logs, and pulp log/ <b>energy</b> <b>wood)</b> significantly impacted forwarding time. Increasing DBH resulted in longer working cycles for the harvester. Heavier loads and longer forwarding distances increased forwarding cycle time, while extracting sawlogs was least expensive and <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> extraction was the most expensive. The marginal cost of the <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> was approximately AU$ 10. 2 m- 3 (AU$ 7. 0 extraction and AU$ 3. 2 harvesting), which is about double the cost of the sawlogs.

40|$|Background: The vast {{majority}} of households in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) depend on wood energy—comprising firewood and charcoal—for their daily energetic needs. Such consumption trends are expected to remain a common feature of SSA's <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> production and supply chains, {{at least in the}} short- to medium-terms. Notwithstanding its importance, <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> generally has low priority in SSA national policies. However, the use of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> is often considered a key driver of unsustainable management and negative environmental consequences in the humid and dry forests. To date, unsystematic assessments of the socio-economic and environmental consequences of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> use have underplayed its significance, thus further hampering policy debates. Therefore, a more balanced approach which considers both demand and supply dynamics is needed. This systematic map aims at providing a comprehensive approach to understanding the role and impacts of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> across all regions and aspects in SSA. Methods: The objective of this systematic map is to collate evidence from studies of environmental and socio-economic impacts of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> value chains, by considering both demand and supply within SSA. The map questions are framed using a Populations, Exposure, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) approach. We name the supply and demand of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> as the “exposure,” composed of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> production, harvesting, processing, and consumption. The populations of interest include both the actors involved in these activities and the forest sites where these activities occur. The comparator is defined as those cases where the same <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> activities occur with i) available/accessible alternative energy sources, ii) regulatory frameworks that govern the sector and iii) alternative technologies for efficient use. The outcomes of interest encompass both socioeconomic and environmental impacts that can affect more than the populations named above. For instance, in addition to the direct socioeconomic impacts felt by participants in the <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> value chain, forest dwellers may experience livelihood changes due to forest degradation caused by external harvesters. Moreover, intensified deforestation in one area may concurrently lead to forest regeneration in another. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

However, analysis also suggests that forest sector markets could be disrupted by expansion in <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> if much higher levels of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> consumption occur, or if projected recovery in housing demand and wood product output does not occur, or if more restrictive constraints or higher costs are imposed on wood residue utilization.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} impact of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> use under underutilized {{conditions}} of wood resources: the impact on promotion of forest maintenance practices (FMPs), user costs, and local economies, using {{the case of a}} local initiative in Nishiwaga, Iwate, Japan. We conducted two main analyses: resource and economic assessment. For resource assessment, we investigate whether wood supply from FMP residue is sufficient to sustainably satisfy new demand created by a local initiative in Nishiwaga, and in how much forest area can FMPs be performed to satisfy the demand. These questions are analyzed by linear programming. Regarding economic assessment, we investigate whether replacement of fossil fuel by <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> brings economic benefit to a user and local economy using input–output analysis. Our overall findings demonstrated that the use of <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> under underutilized situations can lead to an increase of implementations of FMPs and of domestic wood resource supplies from a short-term perspective that comes from residues of the FMPs. We also found that <b>wood</b> <b>energy</b> consumption introduces co-benefits in terms of reduced heating costs for users and a larger economic impact on the local economy than fossil fuel...|$|E
50|$|The refinery’s yearly {{demand for}} wood would be 2 million cubic tons of <b>energy</b> <b>wood.</b> There {{is a total}} of 120,000 {{hectares}} of forest in need of first felling within a 200 kilometer range of Kemi. An amount of 20 million cubic meters of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> can be harvested from it yearly. Currently, approximately 6 million cubic meters of wood is left over in the woods every year. Kaidi Finland has reported that it may also procure <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> from Sweden.|$|R
40|$|Possibilities for energy-wood {{supply and}} {{delivery}} {{costs for the}} eight regions in Northwest Russia have been assessed. By-products from harvesting and mechanical wood processing were considered as sources for energy production based on actual harvesting, sawmill and plywood production in 2006 and was estimated at 30. 7 million m 3. Nearly 30. 5 million m 3 of the <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> could be transported, {{and the rest of}} the <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> was inaccessible due to lack of road infrastructure in the Republic of Komi and the Arkhangelsk region. About 70 % of the <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> was from harvesting, consisting of non-industrial roundwood, unused branches and tops, defective wood resulting from logging, spruce stumps removed after final felling, and 30 % from sawmills and plywood mills, i. e., chips, sawdust and bark. The delivery cost of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> to the potential border-crossing points in Finland was analyzed for three means of transport. The delivery cost of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> by railway varied from 28. 9 to 43. 5 m 3. Volume was estimated as 27. 8 million m 3 and maximum distance as 2110 km to the border station. The cheapest means of delivering <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> was by road. Delivered cost for <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> by road varied from 15. 8 to 18. 5 /m 3. However, the volume was limited to a 200 -km belt along the border between Russia and Finland and was 1. 6 million m 3. The most expensive means of delivering <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> was by waterway. Delivery cost for <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> by waterway varied from 45. 0 to 47. 9 /m 3. The volume was estimated at 0. 8 million m 3 from a remote area without feasible access to railway in the Lake Onego area. It should be emphasized that we have estimated supply and delivery costs, not prices which are defined by the market based on supply and demand...|$|R
40|$|Possibilities for <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> {{procurement}} and {{use in the}} Leningrad {{region of}} Northwest Russia {{as a tool for}} reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been analysed in this report. Calculations have been made for selected area, where resources are available and also other preconditions are appropriate for their use for energy production. The study includes estimation of how much <b>wood</b> for <b>energy</b> purposes could be available {{in the vicinity of the}} selected area, what are suitable supply systems to consumers and what could be expected costs of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> procurement, when taking into account local technical and economical preconditions and constraints. Former Boksitogorsky, Tihvinsky and Sugozersky leshoses in the Tihvin and Boksitogorsk administrative districts have been selected for analysis. There are possibilities for intensification of forest resources utilisation in the region, as annual allowable cut and intermediate fellings are not fully used. Actual available volume of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> generated by fellings in the region is 424, 000 m³ yr>. Full utilisation of annual allowable cut would increase volume of available <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> up to 637, 000 m³ yr - 1 or + 50 %. If also intermediate fellings are entirely utilised, available volume of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> could be increased up to 774, 000 m³ yr - 1 or + 83 % to actual available volume. Productivity and costs of cut-to-lenth, tree length, full tree and tree section harvesting methods in the 1 st and 2 nd commercial thinnings and in final fellings with the transport of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> up to 100 km were analysed. The supply systems based on manual felling in thinnings have lower costs of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> compared to the supply systems which utilise harvesters. Utilisation of harvesters becomes more feasible for final felling, where high productivity allows the cut-to-length method to be more efficient compared to the full tree and tree length methods with manual felling. Costs of <b>energy</b> <b>wood</b> harvesting per <b>energy</b> unit are competitive with the price of electricity and light oil as primary <b>energy</b> sources. <b>Wood</b> fuels can compete with the price of heavy oil in the case of short transporting distances up to 50 km. However, wood fuels can not be competitive with the recent price of coal and natural gas if other factors, like for example high costs of building pipelines to the remote areas and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are not taken into account...|$|R
