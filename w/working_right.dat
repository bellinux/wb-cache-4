I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{negative}} responses, The New Yorkers David Denby said Salt [...] "is as impersonal {{an action}} thriller as we’ve seen in years", finding the supporting cast underexplored – [...] "the tricky plot locks them into purely functional responses". [...] Claudia Puig of the USA Today considered the film a [...] "by-the-book thriller" [...] with Jolie's {{performance as the}} only distinguished feature. [...] Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer was mostly critical of the writing, describing the film as absurd, overplotted and incoherent, and saying the villainous schemes [...] "would have been called off 20 {{years ago at the}} latest, when the Soviet Union dissolved". Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer described Salt as [...] "commendably swift and progressively inane", saying the script was a [...] "sloppy concoction of story elements from '70s espionage classics" [...] that ended up not <b>working</b> <b>right</b> with its [...] "nonsensical setups and wildly illogical twists". James Berardinelli of Reelviews considered that, while the film was fast-paced and the action scenes competently shot, the plot was predictable and [...] "the spy aspects, which are by far the most intriguing elements of the movie, are shunted aside in favor of spectacular stunts and long chases".|$|E

In late 2007 and early 2008, Taborn toured internationally with Underground, guitarist David Torn's Prezens, {{as well as}} being part of shorter tours and making {{occasional}} appearances with Cleaver, Gress, Ibarra, Mitchell, and William Parker. In April 2008 he toured Europe with Berne's Science Friction, was back in Europe for the first three weeks of the following month, this time as part of David Binney's quartet, and returned there in November with Potter. Taborn remarked in 2008 that he was attempting to phase out his use of a laptop in performance, to allow him to concentrate more on improvising, and that he had delayed further performances as a leader, owing to finances. In the same year, he commented on the number of regular, working bands he was a member of: [...] "You could say 15 to 20. But if you're talking about the ones that are regularly <b>working</b> <b>right</b> now, I'd have to say seven or eight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell is {{critical}} of religion and Young Earth Creationism, satirizing them both in Alice In Chains' 2013 Album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. Cantrell stated, [...] "There are two things {{you never want to}} get into a conversation or argument about: politics and religion. But fuck, I guess we're {{going to be talking about}} this for awhile". [...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t <b>working</b> <b>right</b> now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem".|$|E

Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker. The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear, and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover. He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with [...] "good faith" [...] in order [...] "to have more toys to play with as we put together a story", and that [...] "the agreement was {{that it is very}} much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in , and then <b>working</b> <b>right</b> now on the script and soon to be shooting". Sony Pictures chairman Thomas Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel. At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be Spider-Man: Homecoming, a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character [...] "coming home" [...] to Marvel and the MCU. Tony Revolori and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's, and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark. Watts noted that Stark [...] "was always a part of" [...] the films' story because of his interactions with Parker in Civil War.|$|E

They are really right to be always suspecting human institutions; they are right not to put their trust in princes nor in any child of man. The chieftain chosen to be the friend of the people becomes the enemy of the people; the newspaper started to tell the truth now exists to prevent the truth being told. Here, I say, I felt that I was really at last {{on the side of the}} revolutionary. And then I caught my breath again: for I remembered that I was once again on the side of the orthodox.|$|E
