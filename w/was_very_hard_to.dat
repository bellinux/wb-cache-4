5|$|Gatlif {{wanted to}} {{represent}} the entire Romani community through the characterization of Félix Lavil dit Taloche's naiveté and purity. For example, Taloche is shown as being afraid of ghosts, which echoes the Romani phobia. For Taloche's role, Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills, which <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find. In Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville, he was impressed James Thiérrée, a grandson of Charlie Chaplin. A non-Romani, (though Chaplin's grandmother was Romani) Thiérrée learned Romanes and Romani swing music in six months.|$|E

25|$|Many {{women were}} {{forced out of}} their modest ways of life {{due to lack of}} space and privacy in the {{internment}} camps. For example, at Hastings Park, women and children were housed in an area that was previously used for livestock. Prisoners were forced to share one animal stall per family and personal space <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> come by. The partitions were made of the five-foot stall walls and flimsy pieces of fabric. This created very little privacy for the families and caused most women to abandon the previous modest social norms.|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{also clear}} from the law tracts that the {{practice}} of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. Thus, while Críth Gablach mentions some of what each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. Bretha Crólige does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. However, it does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> provision those of the highest rank and obviously impossible to find a substitute to do their work. Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

After the summer the band resumed {{recording}} the album at Rockfield Studios in South Wales– which had been used for the band's first two albums– and also at Amazon Studios in Liverpool. Recording the album was a slow process, de Freitas said, [...] "Porcupine <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> actually write and record [...] Heaven Up Here was pure confidence, we did it really quickly; {{we had a great}} time doing it– but this one was like we had to drag it out of ourselves."

500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Critics commented {{positively}} on {{the development}} of Will and Emma's relationship; TV Guide Natalie Abrams wrote that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode. Flandez felt that the kiss made the [...] "poignant moment" [...] of the glee club's final performance [...] "even more dear", and hoped {{that it would not be}} the last between them, while Aly Semigran of MTV praised the development and called the kiss [...] "sweet [...] longing". Goldman wrote: [...] "Schue and Emma finally coming together <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> not feel good about, even though you know it just won't be that easy when the show returns". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was clear Ken and Emma would not marry, and added that when Will kissed Emma: [...] "I died". In discussing Will and Emma's conversation about how she would have left Ken if Will had shown any interest in her, Pardue commented: [...] "That's maybe the sweetest and the saddest thing I've ever heard." [...] She called the kiss between Will and Emma [...] "romantic" [...] commenting that it made her [...] "heart happy". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson commented that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, or [...] "before she smiled approvingly after their kiss", questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship, or [...] "about freakin' time".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Rugal's {{character has}} been positive. Japanese magazine Gamest ranked Rugal 48th {{on their list}} of the top 50 video game characters introduced in 1994, sharing the spot with Chang Koehan. Video games publications have commented on Rugal's character, adding praise and criticism. Retro Gamer praised the character, stating he [...] "rocks hard...harder than Street Fighters M. Bison". GameAxis Unwired compared Rugal with Street Fighters Akuma in regards to their significacies to their respective developers, with Rugal called the [...] "cheapest [...] in SNK's games." [...] 1UP.com praised the introduction of Omega Rugal in KOF '95, noting him to be [...] "one of the most stylish boss designs in fighting history", although players could hate him due to {{how difficult it is}} to defeat him. However, they mentioned that one of the good points from KOF '96 was the absence of Rugal. Eurogamer reviewer Matt Edwards also commented that Rugal <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> defeat and that he started [...] "a trend in the KOF series of notoriously overpowered bosses who are hard to take down". IGN's Jeremy Dunhan praised Rugal, describing how his character developed the new rules for the King of Fighters tournament, and noted the difficulty in defeating Rugal himself. Listing him as one of the [...] "12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit", GamesRadar claimed that Rugal's difficult as a boss led gamers to coin the term [...] "SNK Boss syndrome." [...] In retrospective, Gaming Age writer Jeff Keely found Rugal and Orochi as difficult bosses but not as difficult as Krizalid from The King of Fighters '99. Den of Geek listed Rugal's upgraded form from Capcom vs. SNK 2 as the best altered character due to how it takes Akuma's special moves as well as other traits. The same site also listed him as the sixth best character from the KOF complimenting him as a good villain based on his traits. Complex listed him as one of the most challenging bosses in gaming, citing how overpowered were some of his moves most notably his [...] "Genocide Cutter". Despite criticizing most of the live-action movie based on the series, Derek Elley from Film Biz found Rugal's role enjoyable.|$|E
