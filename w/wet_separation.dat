40|$|Bottom ash (BA) from {{municipal}} solid waste incineration (MSWI) has high potential for the recovery of valuable secondary materials. For example, the MSWI bottom ash produced by the incinerator at Amsterdam contains materials such as non-ferrous metals (2. 3 %), ferrous metals (8 - 13 %), gold (0. 4 ppm), silver (10 ppm), stainless steel (0. 1 %) and minerals that can be converted into building products such as aggregates utilized for concrete, asphalt, etc. Since the composition of BA varies from country to country, the first step in valorizing it should be characterization. Therefore, this thesis proposes a new system for analysing BA, which concentrates on properties of fractions related to their ease of separation and material value. A common practice in BA treatment in Western Europe is to separate coarse metal particles {{from the rest of the}} material by dry physical separation and to use the residue as a low-value construction material (road fillers) in controlled applications. Unrestricted re-use of this residue as a mineral resource is not possible in most EU countries because, generally, some of the leaching values for salts and metals exceed regulatory limits. In the Netherlands, the quality of building materials must be measured according to the Soil Quality Decree (SQD), which mandates strict environmental limits. Therefore, a new separation solution, based on wet physical treatment, was developed and tested to recover more metals and at the same time produce environmentally clean products that are suitable for various building applications. Wet physical separation processes are preferable to dry methods of mineral processing due to the fact that they allow for more efficient and accurate classifications of size and density. The <b>wet</b> <b>separation</b> system can recover more metals of all size fractions down to 0. 3 mm. <b>Wet</b> <b>separation</b> provides an important advantage through the wet screening process, as fine particles and organics are washed out from the granulate fractions, thereby improving the environmental quality of building products. The high recovery of metals provides financial benefits, and in combination with the washing and removal of organics it also has positive environmental effects. This thesis describes a new separation system, based on wet treatment, which was developed and implemented in a pilot plant in Amsterdam between 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, in addition to the treatments applied in the pilot plant, techniques to separate precious metals, separate stainless steel and improve the quality of the recovered sand were developed, all of which, when implemented, should increase the value of bottom ash. Wet treatment is also able to decrease leaching values to close to, legislative limits in order to produce building materials from BA of a category for which no extra isolation is needed. Nevertheless, leaching values of some contaminants such as copper, molybdenum, antimony, sulphate and chloride still occasionally exceeded the limits. Therefore, this research focused on the correlation between contaminants (salts and metals) and separation settings, composition and input materials, in aim to find the factors which can minimise leaching values. Another objective was to develop a convenient quality control system for building products generated from BA capable of rapidly providing accurate results based on measurements obtained using the column test. A model based on physical parameters such as diffusion, contaminant levels and dissolving factors was developed and demonstrated that it is possible to decrease the time consumed by the column test while still obtaining accurate predictions. The quality of building materials can determine their future utilization, therefore this study also examined the chemical, geometrical and mechanical properties of building materials such as sand and aggregates. Initial tests in which those aggregates and sand were utilized in asphalt, concrete and lime-sand stone were then conducted in attempts to identify the optimal utilization route for such materials. The last part of this thesis presents a financial overview of the process, products and environmental impacts of BA treatment. The <b>wet</b> <b>separation</b> system was compared in these terms with the existing, commonly used dry separation system, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This analysis showed that the wet process has less adverse environmental impacts, of diverse kinds (e. g. global warming and human toxicity potential), than the dry system. The investment and process costs of the pilot system in Amsterdam were also calculated under several scenarios, with various modelled separation capacities, to identify the most financially beneficial scheme for treating (and utilizing) BA.

40|$|An {{important}} step {{of a new}} process being developed for the beneficiation of the mineral zircon (Zr(Hf) SiO 4) to produce nuclear grade zirconium (Zr) metal, is {{the separation of the}} Zr from the hafnium (Hf). Zr ores typically contain between 1 and 3 % Hf, whereas the use of Zr metal in the nuclear industry requires a Hf content < 100 ppm, owing to its relatively high neutron-capture cross section. The separation step is therefore key in the preparation of nuclear grade Zr, which is considered to be very difficult due to the various similarities in their chemical properties. The preparation of hafnium free zirconium relies on traditional <b>wet</b> <b>separation</b> systems, for example solvent extraction systems. In contrast to the traditional aqueous chloride systems, Necsa focusses on dry fluoride-based processes. Dry processes have the advantage of producing much less hazardous chemical waste. In the work reported here, separation is achieved by sublimation/de-sublimation in the tetrafluoride form. The tetrafluoride is prepared by fluorination of plasma dissociated zircon (PDZ or Zr(Hf) O 2 ∙SiO 2) with ammonium bifluoride (ABF). The separation involves the selective sublimation of the two tetrafluorides in an inert atmosphere under controlled conditions, and subsequent similarly selective desublimation. An accurate estimation of the sublimation rates of both the zirconium tetrafluoride (ZrF 4) and hafnium tetrafluoride (HfF 4) as a function of temperature is required since this forms the basis of the development of a sublimation model to determine whether the concept under consideration is theoretically possible. The sublimation kinetics of ZrF 4 is reported in this paper. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|During the <b>wet</b> <b>separation</b> of starch and gluten, both water {{extractable}} pentosans (WEP) {{and water}} unextractable solids (WUS) {{have a negative}} effect on gluten yield. Gluten properties are also affected: the gluten becomes less extensible. In comparison to the control, addition of WUS or WEP resulted in less gluten with a higher maximum resistance to extension (Rmax) and a smaller extensibility at maximum resistance (E at Rmax). The corresponding glutenin macropolymer (GMP) gel was more elastic, and the specific volume of the GMP particles was larger and their tendency to aggregate was lower. In contrast, the use of xylanase or ferulic acid (FA) resulted in a higher gluten yield and a larger E at Rmax of gluten. Here, the GMP was characterised by a more viscous gel structure, a smaller specific volume of the GMP particles and a larger tendency of GMP particles to aggregate. Correlations between gluten properties (Rmax, E at Rmax) and GMP particle properties ([¿], K') were observed. Based on these observations, we propose a possible explanation for the effect of pentosans on gluten formation and properties. Both a physical effect and a chemical effect are involved. The physical effect is related to viscosity and likely also to depletion attraction between protein particles. The chemical effect is related to a FA-mediated effect and ‘controls’ the tendency of the particles to aggregate (K'). The contribution of physical and chemical effects leads to a partial agglomeration of GMP particles and shifts the GMP particle size distribution to a higher value. Since GMP particle properties could be directly related to gluten rheological properties, this explains the change in quality observed...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{of natural}} {{radioactivity}} {{has been used}} in both a qualitative and a quantitative way in mineral exploration, particularly in the search for uranium. In the last five years, the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut (KVI) and British Geological Survey (BGS) have designed, built and tested a new detector system that greatly improves quantitative applications in mineral exploration, especially on the seafloor and in the nearshore zone. The new system is an enhancement of an earlier BGS design. The major improvements comprise the use of a highly sensitive gamma-ray detector, together with new data processing, from which concentrations of natural radionuclides may be deduced in real time. After laboratory analysis of samples, these concentrations can be converted into mineral percentages. Once the mineralogy of an area has been characterized, this conversion can also be done in real time. Thus far the system has mainly been used to map heavy-mineral concentrations in coastal subtidal and intertidal sediments. For such work the multi-sensor detector probe is towed on the seafloor and various parameters are recorded continuously. The probe contains, in addition to the gamma-ray detector, a water-pressure sensor (giving water depth) and an acoustic device to measure bottom roughness. The system, when used together with high-precision positioning systems such as D-GPS, enables the production of detailed maps of bathymetry, bottom roughness, and seafloor radioactivity or mineral distribution. These maps allow mineral concentrations to be readily correlated with seabed topography and sediment type. In the same way, gamma-ray detectors could be used advantageously during dredging operations to provide on-line assessment of the mineral content of the dredged sediment as well as to guide the direction of dredging. Additionally, the same technique could be used to monitor the subsequent fate of a dredge spoil after dumping on the seafloor. Natural radioactivity arising from potassium and the thorium and uranium decay series has potential use for the fast and reliable assessment of siliciclastic and phosphatic impurities in limestones. Detection of such impurities may preclude the use of the limestone for chemical or cement production. Apart from its use in exploration, the technique has significant potential in mineral processing, particularly of heavy minerals. It can be applied as on-line quality control in dry and <b>wet</b> <b>separation</b> processes and for process control, by using decisions based on the results to control valves and other instrumentation. In addition, it can also be used in environmental monitoring of waste arising from mineral extraction and processing. In conclusion, the technique described has a diversity of applications in exploration, mining and mineral processing. (C) 1997 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum...|$|E

The results show that under the proper conditions, a final metallic iron powder assaying over 91 % Fe and 0. 25 % P was obtained with iron recovery of 90 % and phosphorus removal rate of 91. 79 % using the new process, indicating that the high temperature flash reduction process is a feasible and efficient way to process this kind of complex and refractory iron ore. Moreover, sodium sulfate {{is found to be}} capable of improving the removal of phosphorus and the upgrading of iron, as well as enhancing the growth of metallic iron grains significantly for higher recovery of iron...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{composting}} {{systems for}} biowaste generally produce low quality composts that may endanger recycling. A pilot-scale bioconversion process yielding quality compost {{and renewable energy}} was designed and tested. The process consisted {{of a set of}} <b>wet</b> physical <b>separation</b> units, composting and anaerobic digestion. Biowaste was divided in four streams by physical separation: (1) organic fraction > 2 mm, (2) inorganic fraction 0. 05 - 2 mm, (3) residual fraction composed of organics 0. 05 - 2 mm and the fraction 2 mm was composted and the compost, high in organic matter and low in EC and heavy metals, aimed at replacing peat in horticulture. The inorganic fraction 0. 05 - 2 mm was completely made up of sand and {{can be used as a}} construction material. Solubilised organic matter in the washing water was converted to CH 4 by anaerobic digestion. The residual fraction can be used as landfill cover material. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine a {{possibility}} that fly ash could be used as raw material for carbonation by conducting the experiment on magnetic separation and hydration of fly ash that contained a large amount of CaO composite. <b>Wet</b> magnetic <b>separation</b> experiment was performed to remove the component of magnetic substance that contained fly ash, which aimed at increasing the content of CaO in the non-magnetic domain. The selected fly ash was used for hydration experiment before the TG-DTA, XRF and XRD analyses were made to confirm the Ca component that could be carbonated. Then, the fly ash was turned to a hydrate that was favorable to dissociation of Ca 2 + ion. As a result, the magnetic separation enabled detecting the content of CaO component by up to 61 wt % in the non-magnetic domain. Since the hydrate was confirmed, it is believed that the fly ash can be use...|$|R
40|$|Coal Fly ash from Sultan Abdul Aziz Power Station in Kapar, Malaysia was {{characterized}} {{and used for}} the synthesis of zeolites. Coal Fly ash was pretreated with <b>Wet</b> High Intensity <b>Separation</b> (WHIMS) to remove undesirable iron components prior {{to the formation of}} synthetic zeolites. The synthesis method used was a hydrothermal treatment with NaOH activation at low temperature. The hydrothermal reaction produced stable zeolite P which increased in crystallinity as temperature and reaction time increased. Mineral transformation during hydrothermal treatment involved the dissolution of aluminosilicate glass and formation of synthetic zeolite P with a high Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{knowledge}} about properties of thermal power sludge from coal combustion in smelting boilers is presented. The physical and technological properties of slag – granularity, density, specific, volume and pouring weight, hardness and decoupling – together with chemical properties influence its exploitation. The possibility of concentrating the Fe component by the mineral processing technologies (<b>wet</b> low-intenzity magnetic <b>separation)</b> is verified. An industrial {{use of the}} slag in civil engineering, e. g. road construction, was realised. The slag-fly ashes are directly utilized in the cement production as a substitute of a part of natural raw materials. For the use of slag as the stoneware in the road construction, all the criteria are fulfilled...|$|R
