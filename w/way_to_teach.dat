25|$|Children in {{indigenous}} communities can also {{learn from the}} underlying message of a story. For example, in a nahuatl community near Mexico City, stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back {{in some way to}} the ahuaque, the protagonist dies. In this way, storytelling serves as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> what the community values, such as valuing the environment.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{both the}} {{relative}} scarcity of cadavers {{to be used for}} surgical instruction and to the dwindling use of animals and patients who have not given consent, institutes may utilize medical animations as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> doctors-to-be anatomical and surgical concepts. Such simulations may be viewed passively (as in the case of 3D medical animations included via CD-ROM in medical textbook packages) or using interactive controls. The stimulation of hand-eye skills using haptics is another possible use of medical animation technology, one that stems from the replacement of cadavers in surgical classrooms with task trainers and mannequins.|$|E

They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life. In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

More than 500,000 US pilots were trained on Link simulators, as were pilots of nations as diverse as Australia, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Pakistan, and the USSR. Following WWII, Air Marshall Robert Leckie (wartime RAF Chief of Staff) said “The Luftwaffe met its Waterloo on all the training fields of the free world where there was a battery of Link Trainers.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most children know that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They know that these words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. If a child is able to master this skill, called phonological awareness, {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E
