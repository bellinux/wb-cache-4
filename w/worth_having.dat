[...] Kim escalated the feud with her mixtape, Black Friday (2011), whose title and artwork mimic Pink Friday; a fragment from Minaj's diss track, [...] "Tragedy", previewed that April.

500|$|Williams' {{portrayal}} of the role was intended {{to act as a}} counterpoint to Jerry Hardin's {{portrayal of}} X's predecessor, Deep Throat. Whereas Deep Throat had been a selfless character, X was written and performed as a scared, selfish character. Prior to the episode [...] "One Breath", Glen Morgan had felt that the character of X was not [...] "going over too well" [...] with fans of the series, as he seemed to simply be a copy of Deep Throat. Believing Williams to be an actor <b>worth</b> <b>having</b> as a series regular, he included in the episode a scene in which X murders witnesses who have seen him speaking to Fox Mulder. Morgan felt that such a scene reflected X's paranoia and the difference between him and his predecessor, noting that [...] "Deep Throat was a guy willing to lose his life for letting out the secret, whereas X is a guy who's still scared". [...] Williams has stated that he has never attempted to rationalize the character's motives or imagine a backstory for him, preferring to play the role with as little background as possible; he once stated [...] "the less I know about him, the more interesting he becomes." ...|$|E

[...] Although he felt Avatar would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic, he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: [...] "If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience." [...] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant [...] "repeat business" [...] just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same [...] "sharing" [...] reaction as Titanic. He said that film worked because, [...] "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it.

500|$|Early {{versions}} featured simplified graphics, and {{the different}} ports were met with mixed reception. John Harris of Gamasutra thought the arcade's popularity fueled the sales of the home versions, while Thomas Hanley of ScrewAttack commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball. Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and collision detection. He listed the Amiga, Game Boy, and Sega Mega Drive ports as the better conversions, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, PC, and Game Boy Advance versions among the worst. Compute! writers called the Amiga version's graphics and gameplay [...] "arcade-quality". Computer Gaming World stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original. Bruce Webster of BYTE wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of Marble Madness in December 1986 [...] "are really amazing". While criticizing {{the lack of a}} pause function or a top scores list, he stated that it [...] "is definitely <b>worth</b> <b>having</b> if you own an Amiga". Bil Herd recalled that the Amiga version was so popular at Commodore International that employees stole the required memory expansion from colleagues' computers to run the game. He wrote [...] "Not an Amiga" [...] on his Commodore 128D so others would not open it looking for Amiga memory. Info gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a totally faithful adaptation". It gave the Commodore 64 version three-plus stars out of five, describing it as [...] "just a shadow of the arcade original and the excellent Amiga version" [...] and inferior to Spindizzy. The magazine liked the graphics but criticized [...] "marbles that handle like intoxicated turtles". Dragons three reviewers—Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser—praised the Apple II port, calling it a [...] "must have" [...] title for arcade fans.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{favourable}} assessment, for the NME, Alan Smith {{wrote that}} while on first listen he found McCartney [...] "too harmlessly mild", his view had changed with time, such that: [...] "Listening {{to it is}} like hearing a man's personal contentment committed {{to the sound of}} music. Most of the sounds, effects and ideas are sheer brilliance; much of the aura is of quiet songs on a hot summer night; and virtually all of the tracks reflect a kind of intangible roundness. 'Excitement' is not a word to use for this album ... 'warmth' and 'happiness' are." [...] In his combined review of all the former Beatles' 1970 solo releases, Geoffrey Cannon of The Guardian dismissed it as an album that had [...] "no substance". Cannon continued: [...] "Paul reveals himself in it as a man preoccupied with himself, and his own situation. The music is boastfully casual … He seems to believe that anything that comes into his head is <b>worth</b> <b>having.</b> And he's wrong." [...] John Gabree of High Fidelity magazine similarly bemoaned the expectation that [...] "we should dig his every little noise" [...] and found the reasons for the album's failure evident in the Let It Be film, where McCartney appeared to be [...] "the only Beatle who has stagnated as a human being", as well as [...] "incredibly arrogant" [...] in his treatment of his bandmates. Gabree added that [...] "Perhaps the greatest disappointment lies in the songs, although most of them could have been saved by better performances, especially the instrumentals." ...|$|E
