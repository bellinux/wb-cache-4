5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian <b>wildlife</b> care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, <b>Wildlife</b> Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley <b>Wildlife</b> Carers, WIRES, and <b>Wildlife</b> Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently <b>wildlife</b> advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of <b>wildlife</b> safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install <b>wildlife</b> unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of <b>wildlife</b> safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on <b>wildlife</b> rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and <b>Wildlife</b> Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Naturalists’ Trust was founded, {{and it was}} {{followed}} by the Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire <b>Wildlife</b> Trust in 1961, the Northamptonshire <b>Wildlife</b> Trust in 1963, and the Peterborough <b>Wildlife</b> Group in 1987. The Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire trusts merged in 1990, and a further merger produced the <b>Wildlife</b> Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire and Peterborough in 1994. Peterborough was dropped from the name (but still covered by the trust) in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for <b>wildlife</b> due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} {{impediment}} to <b>wildlife</b> migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. <b>Wildlife</b> crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six <b>wildlife</b> overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E
5|$|The Trust's {{activities}} include managing nature reserves, advising landowners {{on how to}} manage their land for <b>wildlife,</b> commenting on planning applications, advising planning authorities and campaigning to protect <b>wildlife.</b> The Trust also encourages people to be active volunteers helping to maintain nature reserves.|$|E

5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future <b>wildlife</b> management of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing <b>wildlife</b> in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, <b>wildlife</b> populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E

The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E
5|$|Large {{parts of}} Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with {{abundant}} <b>wildlife.</b> Deforestation and poaching {{has reduced the}} amount of <b>wildlife.</b> Woodland degradation and deforestation, due to population growth, urban expansion and lack of fuel, are major concerns and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil.

In the 2012 national <b>wildlife</b> survey, 25 tigers were recorded. As per the 2011 census, the Sathyamangalam forests was home to over 850 Indian elephants and {{is part of a}} protected area, which consists of the largest Asian elephant population in the world.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{has also}} suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it {{was listed as}} an endangered species, but the United States Fish and <b>Wildlife</b> Service and state <b>wildlife</b> agencies in the Southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it {{was removed from the}} endangered species list. Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the Rockefeller <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge, a large area of marshland in the state of Louisiana. The resulting data has increased understanding of penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing, and diet, and this information has been used at other establishments around the world. Income from the alligators kept at Rockefeller <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge contributes to conservation of the marshland. A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed that they have generated significant conservation gains, and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.|$|E

5|$|The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) {{were first}} {{protected}} on February 3, 1909, when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation through , {{as a response}} to the over-harvesting of seabirds, and in recognition of the importance of the NWHI as seabird nesting sites. President Franklin D. Roosevelt converted it into the Hawaiian Islands National <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge in 1940. A series of incremental protections followed, leading to the establishment of Midway Atoll National <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge in 1988, Kure Atoll State <b>Wildlife</b> Sanctuary in 1993, and the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Sathyamangalam forests were {{declared}} as {{a sanctuary}} {{with effect from}} 3 November 2008 by the Governor of Tamil Nadu as per the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972. In 2008, the Government of Karnataka sent a proposal to declare the contiguous Billigiriranga Swamy Temple <b>Wildlife</b> Sanctuary as a tiger reserve which was subsequently approved in 2010. In a <b>wildlife</b> {{survey conducted by the}} Government of Tamil Nadu in 2010, 46 tigers were sighted in the Sathyamangalam forest area.
