25|$|Employment {{trends in}} Bogotá {{indicate}} that rates of unemployment have fallen while {{a growing number}} of citizens are looking for work. This paradox can largely be explained by ongoing urbanization into Bogotá, therefore poverty remains a substantial problem. Jobs have been created in some sectors, and women are gaining more opportunities for employment, but more progress is needed. Overall, poverty since 1970 has decreased; however, data collected and presented in 2006 by UN-HABITAT at the <b>World</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Forum</b> in Vancouver, Canada reveal that 50% of the population still live in poverty and many of those live in slums. A separate UN-HABITAT report from 2003 describes three types of slums in Bogotá: inner-city, those lying on the perimeter, and squatter settlements. The total number of those living under these conditions is around 700,000. Additional data by UN-HABITAT shows that wealth is very unevenly distributed and that pockets of poverty exist in Bogotá that are poorer than the poorest regions of the country as a whole.|$|E
