40|$|<b>We</b> {{recently}} <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> exogenous zinc {{was capable}} of counteracting LPS-induced decreases in labile [Zn]i (i. e., TPEN chelatable, FluoZin- 3 detectable) and simultaneously abrogated LPS-induced apoptosis in SPAECs. In an abbreviated survey {{of the effect of}} LPS on potential zinc transporters, <b>we</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> LPS increased mRNA of zinc importer, SLC 39 A 14 or ZIP 14 (and this effect was mimicked by zinc chelator, TPEN) suggesting that increased expression of SLC 39 A 14 may be an homeostatic mechanism to maintain [Zn]i and reduce cellular toxicity to LPS. In the current study, <b>we</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> knockdown of SLC 39 A 14 with siRNA rendered SPAECs more sensitive to LPS-induced apoptosis and also impaired the ability of exogenous zinc to rescue this effect. <b>We</b> also previously <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> iNOS or chemically derived (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP)) nitric oxide (NO) is associated with resistant phenotype to LPS-induced apoptosis in a zinc dependent fashion. Since ZIP 14 expression has been reported to be indirectly upregulated by NO, we pursued this connection in SPAECs by silencing ZIP 14 using siRNA technology. <b>We</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> NO-mediated resistance to LPS-induced apoptosis was independent of ZIP 14 but was critically dependent upon the presence of sheep metallothionein (MT). In particular, genetic silencing of these collective forms of sheep MT isoforms abrogated the NO-dependent resistant phenotype to LPS-induced apoptosis as well as abolishing NO-mediated increases in [Zn]i. Collectively, these data confirm that increases in labile [Zn]i are an important component of ZIP 14 - or NO-mediated resistance to LPS-induced apoptosis. Cytoprotection via ZIP 14 appears to be secondary to transcellular movement of extracellular zinc whereas NO mediated protection is secondary to S-nitrosation of MT and redistribution of intracellular zinc...|$|R
