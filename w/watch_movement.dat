25|$|Since 2000, silicon {{has found}} a new use in {{mechanical}} <b>watch</b> <b>movements.</b> Several manufacturers of mechanical <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the escapements and balance wheel regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon escapement wheels and forks. Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following. Most of these parts for <b>watch</b> <b>movements</b> are manufactured by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).|$|R
