500|$|The reveal of Tracer being canonically lesbian was {{generally}} well-received by media outlets and players alike. USgamer called it [...] "an impressive move for Blizzard, given that Tracer is their flagship character". Polygons Allegra Frank described the reveal as one [...] "that fans have waited a long, long time for". Peter Amato of Paste commented, [...] "While a vocal minority has made their disapproval of said announcement clear, the larger fan base's reaction has ranged from indifferent to cheering." [...] Kotaku had {{several of its}} writers react to the reveal, with the consensus being a positive reception. The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a previous statement from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing a queer character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing a queer character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think having something explicit was necessary [...] Having something definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward heartwarming tale of <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>matters</b> during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has been anything but. Messages decrying Blizzard's [...] "mistake" [...] have cropped up all over the Overwatch forums and other social media, countered by others praising the studio for explicitly stating—in a low-key fashion—that the face of one of the biggest games of the year is gay.|$|E

They were hungry for this and the group began to thrive in just a short space of time. The curacy culminated in helping to design the new daughter church of St Barnabas, strengthening an interest in architecture that in later years has proved fruitful again and again both with actual buildings and with the architectonics of theology and institutions.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack by David Schwartz {{does not}} include any songs by the Beatles because [...] "the producers could not get clearance from the notoriously difficult copyright holders, a company owned by Michael Jackson."

6000|$|It {{was nearly}} ten o'clock that evening before he reached home, {{motoring}} {{back from the}} route march. His physical tiredness was abated, for he had partaken of a snack and a whisky and soda at the hotel; but mentally {{he was in a}} curious mood. His body felt appeased, his spirit hungry. Tonight he had a yearning, not for his wife's kisses, but for her understanding. He wanted to go to her and say: [...] "I've learnt a lot to-day-found out things I never thought of. Life's a wonderful thing, Kate, a thing one can't live all to oneself; a thing one shares with everybody, so that when another suffers, one suffers too. It's come to me that what one has doesn't matter a bit--it's what one does, and how one sympathises with other people. It came to me in the most extraordinary vivid way, when I was on that jury, watching that poor little rat of a soldier in his trap; it's the first time I've ever felt--the--the spirit of Christ, you know. It's a wonderful thing, Kate--wonderful! We haven't been close--really close, you and I, so that we each understand what the other is feeling. It's all in that, you know; understanding--sympathy--it's priceless. When I saw that poor little devil taken down and sent back to his regiment to begin his sorrows all over again--wanting his wife, thinking and thinking of her just as you know I would be thinking and wanting you, I felt what an awful outside sort of life we lead, never telling each other what we really think and feel, never being really close. I daresay that little chap and his wife keep nothing from each other--live each other's lives. That's what we ought to do. Let's get to feeling that <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>matters</b> is--understanding and loving, and not only just saying it as we all do, those fellows on the jury, and even that poor devil of a judge--what an awful life judging one's fellow-creatures.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the reader}} {{who has been}} on the spot the poet's words will paint a vivid picture of the scene; for the reader who has not been there, so much the worse; he should lose no time in going, and {{drinking}} a cup of the local wine at a table of the restaurant now in possession of Mr. Gray's point of view. I do not know a more filling moment, exclusive of the wine, than he can enjoy there, with those cascades before him and those temples beside him; for Mr. Gray has mentioned only one of the two, I do not know why, that exist on this enchanted spot, and that define their sharp, black shadows as with an inky line just beyond the restaurant tables. One is round and the other oblong, and the round one has been called the Sibyls', though now it is getting itself called Vesta's--the goddess who long unrightfully claimed the temple of Mater Matuta in the Forum Boarium at Rome. As Vesta has lately been dispossessed there by archaeology (which seems in Rome to enjoy the plenary powers of our Boards of Health), she may have been given the Sibyls' Temple at Tivoli in compensation; but all this does not really matter. <b>What</b> <b>really</b> <b>matters</b> is the mighty chasm which yawns away almost from your feet, where you sit, and the cataracts, from their brinks, high or low, plunging into it, and the wavering columns of mist weakly striving upward out of it: the whole hacked by those mountains Mr. Gray mentions, with belts of olive orchard on their flanks, and wild paths furrowing and wrinkling their stern faces. To your right there is a sheeted cataract falling from the basins of the town laundry, where the toil of the washers melts into music, and their chatter, like that of birds, drifts brokenly across the abyss to you. While you sit musing or murmuring in your rapture, two mandolins and a guitar smilingly intrude, and after a prelude of Italian airs swing into strains which presently, through your revery, you recognize as [...] "In the Bowery" [...] and [...] "Just One Girl," [...] and the smile of the two mandolins and the guitar spreads to a grin of sympathy, and you are no longer at the Cafe Sibylla in Tivoli, but in your own Manhattan on some fairy roof-garden, or at some sixty-cent table d'hote, with wine and music included.|$|E

He proposed a number of remedies, including the strengthening of his own office and ensuring that the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer was a trained lawyer.|$|R
