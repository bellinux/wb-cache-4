He added that, [...] "hile Bow Wow's more mature stance suits him well, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how his younger fans and mainstream R radio {{react to the}} teenage MC's new image. Either way, Bow Wow has proven that his act is no child's play." [...] Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews was also positive towards the song saying, [...] "Annoying bird calls aside, it is a catchy song about Bow Wow trying to catch a little punani." ...|$|E
500|$|After its publication, The Immortals of Meluha {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from critics for its concept but the prose received mixed reviews. Pradip Bhattacharya from The Statesman {{felt that the}} [...] "plot skips along at a brisk pace, the characters are well etched and the reader’s attention {{is not allowed to}} flag. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how the trilogy progresses. One cannot but admire the creative drive that impels a finance professional to embark on such an ambitious odyssey on uncharted seas." [...] Another review by Gaurav Vasudev from the same newspaper wrote that [...] "the book is a gripping mythological story written in modern style." ...|$|E
500|$|David Blackwell of the American review site Enterline Media said, [...] "MI-5 really {{impressed}} {{me with the}} first two seasons. The third season does start {{out for the first}} three episodes before it reaches some highs and lows until it stabilizes with the last two episodes of season 3." [...] He felt that Tom Quinn's exit was his favourite moment in the first two episodes, and that Adam is [...] "just [...] cold" [...] as Tom. He also praised the character development, stating [...] "character development is excellent in this season. Danny receives great moments as he is brought into the spotlight from his feelings for Zoe to his conflicted feelings about things he does in the name of Queen and Country, but Danny doesn't break and let his emotions become a crutch like Tom did (when Tom wanted a sleeper agent not to the job MI-5 wanted the sleeper to do)." [...] Blackwell concluded by saying [...] "sometime MI-5 fails as a show this season, but it still reaches levels of greatness. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what they have in store for season 4." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 October 2007, a {{day after}} the {{announcement}} of Bianca's return, it was announced that Sid Owen would also be returning to the show as Ricky. Owen commented: [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what has been happening to Ricky and Bianca over the last few years. Although, I must admit I'm not looking forward to her nagging me by shouting his name." [...] Santer commented: [...] "First Patsy comes home, now Sid!

2500|$|Zawisa gave issue #7 four stars, {{praising the}} work of artist Stephanie Hans, writing, [...] "Fearless Defenders #7 takes what could, and maybe should, have been a {{breather}} issue for the characters and readers and emotionally amplifies it. Hans' beautiful artwork is perfect for a story of love and sacrifice. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what visual approach this title takes next issue and beyond, but for now, {{this is one of}} the best-looking issues for this series." [...] Corey Schroeder [...] of Comic Vine gave it five stars writing, [...] "Without going into TOO much detail, I will say that I love that this issue brings back a trope from old Thor comics and applies it to Valkyrie in a way that is far more interesting than even the original was." [...] Grey gave it a 9.3, writing, [...] "There's an energy to the book's visuals that is equal parts elegant and exciting. Bunn and Hans make for a hell of a team and issue #7 proves to be one of the series' best yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 29 October 2007 that Patsy Palmer would be reprising {{the role of}} Bianca in EastEnders. A day later, it {{was announced}} that Sid Owen would also be returning to the show as Ricky. Owen commented: [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what has been happening to Ricky and Bianca over the last few years. Although, I must admit I'm not looking forward to her nagging me by shouting his name." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer commented: [...] "First Patsy comes home, now Sid! Ricky and Bianca were a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show [...] Seeing Bianca back on the show is exciting in itself, but to throw Ricky into the equation gives things an added dimension. Ricky's a great and much-loved character in his own right, but what's really exciting to me is the two of them together. There's so much history, drama and passion to explore [...] There'll always be a connection between Ricky and Bianca". To promote the characters' return, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008. One trailer utilised Bianca's [...] "trademark holler" [...] of Ricky's name, which is so loud that it smashes the windows of The Queen Victoria public house. The trailer featured the Righteous Brothers' song [...] "Hung on You".|$|E
2500|$|Non-video game {{publications}} gave {{high praise}} for the game also. [...] The Digital Fix gave it nine out of ten, saying that it [...] "marks a new direction for the series and one that deserves your attention. Not only does it provide top notch visuals, a fantastic summer soundtrack and a wealth of racing options, it makes a traditionally sterile racing simulator just down right [...] fun." [...] The Daily Telegraph gave it a score of four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a thrilling, charismatic, feel-good racer. They are the definitions that matter." [...] The Globe and Mail also gave it a score of eight out of ten, calling it [...] "a refreshing take on the racing genre that successfully straddles the line between serious car porn simulation and arcade-like bang 'em up games (including its voracious hunger for your [...] "quarters")." [...] Digital Spy similarly gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how Forza Horizon fares against , Criterion's new open world racer that is out next month. But {{in the absence of}} that review, it is clear that Playground Games has seriously raised the bar in all areas for the non-linear racing genre with Forza Horizon, and others will now have to play catchup." [...] The Guardian likewise gave it four stars out of five, stating, [...] "The game's most compelling aspect is its almost RPG-like popularity engine, which encourages you to see every slight kink in the road as a means to show off. If driving like a hooligan without having to face any consequences – in cars you'll never be able to afford – sounds appealing, then you'll love Forza Horizon. Whether by accident or design, Microsoft has hit upon a format that gives its flagship driving franchise the credibility it previously lacked." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{you are to}} {{be shown}} Amy's room, we are {{permitted}} to describe it, though not to tell (which {{would be much more}} interesting) why a girl of seventeen has, as her very own, the chief room of a house. The moment you open the door of this room (and please, you are not to look consciously at the escritoire as if you knew the diary was in it) you are aware, though Amy may not be visible, that there is an uncommonly clever girl in the house. The door does not always open easily, because attached thereto is a curtain which frequently catches in it, and this curtain is hand-sewn (extinct animals); indeed a gifted woman's touch is everywhere; if you are not hand-sewn you are almost certainly hand-painted, but incompletely, for Amy in her pursuit of the arts has often to drop one in order to keep pace with another. Some of the chairs have escaped as yet, but their time will come. The table-cover and the curtains are of a lovely pink, perforated ingeniously with many tiny holes, which when you consider them against a dark background, gradually assume the appearance of something pictorial, such as a basket of odd flowers. The fender stool is in brown velvet, and there are words on it that invite you to sit down. Some of the letters of this message have been burned away. There are artistic white bookshelves hanging lopsidedly here and there, and they also have pink curtains, no larger than a doll's garments. These little curtains are for covering the parts where there are no books as yet. The pictures on the walls are mostly studies done at school, and include the well-known windmill, and the equally popular old lady by the shore. Their frames are of fir-cones, glued together, or of straws which have gone limp, and droop like streaks of macaroni. There is a cosy corner; also a milking-stool, but no cow. The lampshades have had ribbons added to them, and from a distance look like ladies of the ballet. The flower-pot also is in a skirt. Near the door is a large screen, such as people hide behind in the more ordinary sort of play; it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether we can resist the temptation to hide some one behind it.|$|E
