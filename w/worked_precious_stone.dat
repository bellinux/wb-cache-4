60|$|On his {{way home}} Mr. Rolles {{purchased}} a <b>work</b> on <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> and several of Gaboriau's novels. These last he eagerly skimmed until an advanced hour in the morning; but although they introduced him to many new ideas, he could nowhere discover {{what to do with}} a stolen diamond. He was annoyed, moreover, to find the information scattered amongst romantic story-telling, instead of soberly set forth after the manner of a manual; and he concluded that, even if the writer had thought much upon these subjects, he was totally lacking in educational method. For the character and attainments of Lecoq, however, he was unable to contain his admiration.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} of quarrying granite and limestone was an advanced technology {{by the time}} the pyramids were being built. Marble, alabaster and diorite were used for making statues, basalt for making sarcophagi, and dolomite for hammers to <b>work</b> hard <b>stones.</b> <b>Precious</b> and semi-precious <b>stones</b> that were extensively mined and worked as well included turquoise, beryl, amethyst, lapis lazuli and malachite. Hathor was the miner's patron goddess, and her temples, statues or inscriptions were found in many rediscovered mining locations.

25|$|The {{artisans}} {{with the}} highest social status were those who worked with metals and feathers, {{as well as those}} who <b>worked</b> with semi <b>precious</b> <b>stones.</b> The reason for this was that these artisan produced goods used by the ruling classes as well as offerings to the gods. Michoacán was one of Mesoamerica’s major metal working centers, mastering hammering, metal coating and metal casting by the time the Spanish arrived. Most metal work was in gold, but the Purépecha had developed some copper work. Most of the products were ornaments for the ruling classes but some utilitarian items such as needles, fishhooks and hole punches were made. Luxury goods made with fine feathers was a particularly appreciated by Purépecha society. Goods such as caps, blankets, clothing, headdresses and ornamental staffs adorned with feathers were used only by priests and rulers as symbols of power and dignity. Artisans who made these objects had their own designation, “izquarecucha.” Purépecha stone work includes the working of turquoise and other semi <b>precious</b> <b>stones</b> along with obsidian. Most were used in adornments and offerings but obsidian was also used for agricultural tools of high economic value, weapons and sacrificial knives. Stoneworkers’ graves can be identified by their goods, which included their tools and raw materials.|$|R
