Lawrence, {{suffering}} from laryngitis, had missed the dress rehearsal but managed {{to make it through the}} first public performance. The Variety critic noted that despite her recent illness she [...] "slinks, acts, cavorts, and in general exhibits exceedingly well her several facets for entertaining", but the Philadelphia Bulletin printed that her [...] "already thin voice is now starting to wear a great deal thinner". [...] Leland Hayward came to see the show in New Haven and shocked Rodgers by advising him to close it before it went any further. [...] Additionally, when the show left New Haven for Boston for more tryout performances, it was still at least 45minutes too long.

60|$|It took {{no little}} will power {{to hold her}} there {{when she wanted to}} steal after him through the woods and find out what he meant. But his {{reputation}} influenced even her and she refused to pit her cunning in the forest against his. It would be better to wait until he returned to his horse. Thus decided, she lay back again in her covert and gave her mind over to pondering curiosity. Sooner than she expected she espied Isbel approaching through the forest, empty handed. He had not taken his rifle. Ellen averted her glance a moment and thrilled to see the rifle leaning against a rock. Verily Jean Isbel had been far removed from hostile intent that day. She watched him stride swiftly up to his horse, untie the halter, and mount. Ellen had an impression of his arrowlike straight figure, and sinuous grace and ease.

But Gyp noticed none of them, except now and again a dog which sniffed her knees in passing. For months she had resolutely cultivated insensibility, resolutely refused to face reality; the barrier was forced now, and the flood had swept her away. [...] "Proceedings!" [...] Mr. Wagge had said. To those who shrink from letting their secret affairs be known even by their nearest friends, the notion of a public exhibition of troubles simply never comes, and it had certainly never come to Gyp. With a bitter smile she thought: 'I'm better off than she is, after all! Suppose I loved him, too? No, I never--never--want to love. Women who love suffer too much.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{appears that}} Dr. Coutras had gone {{one day to}} Taravao {{in order to see}} an old chiefess who was ill, and he gave a vivid picture of the obese old lady, lying in a huge bed, smoking cigarettes, and {{surrounded}} by a crowd of dark-skinned retainers. When he had seen her he was taken into another room and given dinner -- raw fish, fried bananas, and chicken -- <i que sais-je>, the typical dinner of the <i indigene> -- and while he was eating it he saw a young girl being driven away from the door in tears. He thought nothing of it, but when he went out to get into his trap and drive home, he saw her again, standing a little way off; she looked at him with a woebegone air, and tears streamed down her cheeks. He asked someone what <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> and was told that she had come down from the hills to ask him to visit a white man who was sick. They had told her that the doctor could not be disturbed. He called her, and himself asked what she wanted. She told him that Ata had sent her, she who used to be at the Hotel de la Fleur, and that the Red One was ill. She thrust into his hand a crumpled piece of newspaper, and when he opened it he found in it a hundred-franc note.|$|E
