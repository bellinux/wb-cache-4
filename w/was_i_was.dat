500|$|In Alexandria, Owumi {{received}} a satisfactory offer from El-Olympi, a local team coached {{by one of}} Azmy's former players. Going against the will of his family, Owumi chose to follow his coach {{because he did not}} want his relatives to see him in his poor physical and mental state, and he felt that he could recover by playing basketball. He said, [...] "The real reason why I didn't come home <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just too raw. You know, I would look in the mirror, and I couldn't recognize myself." [...] He also believed that a return to basketball would help him slowly reduce the trauma from Libya. However, during his stint, his father fell into a diabetic coma, giving Owumi additional stress. The Nigerian finished the final two weeks of the season with El-Olympi. He led his new team to 13 straight wins, won the championship, and was named postseason MVP.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{became a}} {{favorite}} of the filmmakers of the French New Wave whose films contain many allusions to Vigo's work.
