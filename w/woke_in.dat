25|$|By the 1930s, {{during the}} Great Depression, the formula was tweaked: Daddy Warbucks lost his fortune {{due to a}} corrupt rival and {{ultimately}} died from despair at the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Annie remained an orphan, and for several years had adventures that involved more internationally based enemies. The contemporary events taking place in Europe were reflected in the strips during the 1940s and World War II. Daddy Warbucks was reunited with Annie, as his death was changed to coma, from which he <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> 1945.|$|E
500|$|The cast {{did many}} rehearsals, {{including}} on-location rehearsals, which Dennings described as [...] "the most practical thing I've ever heard of". During {{the course of}} filming, the actors slept during the day, <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon, had their make-up applied on set, and filmed from dusk until dawn. The cast and crew members would often sit inside The Jerk-Offs' van between takes to avoid the cold, and sometimes stayed inside, out of sight, while scenes were being filmed in the van. Reshoots of the film began in May 2008; the film had originally begun at The Jerk-Offs' show where Nick and Norah first meet, and all prior scenes were written in later. Editor Myron Kerstein cut some of the shots on set due to time and budgetary restraints.|$|E

2500|$|Her last play, 4.48 Psychosis, was {{completed}} shortly {{before she died}} and was performed in 2000, at the Royal Court, directed by James Macdonald. This, Kane's shortest and most fragmented theatrical work, dispenses with plot and character, and no indication is given as to how many actors were intended to voice the play. Written {{at a time when}} Kane was suffering from severe depression, it has been described by her fellow-playwright and friend David Greig as having as its subject the [...] "psychotic mind". According to Greig, the title derives from the time—4:48a.m.—when Kane, in her depressed state, frequently <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> the morning.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 October {{the court}} heard {{testimony}} from two further {{men who had}} survived attempts by Nilsen to strangle them. The first of these individuals, Paul Nobbs, provided testimony which the prosecution asserted was evidence of Nilsen's self-control and ability to refrain from homicidal impulses. A university student, Nobbs testified that he accompanied Nilsen to Cranley Gardens for alcohol and sex and <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> {{the early hours of}} the morning with [...] "a terrible headache". Upon washing his face in Nilsen's bathroom, as Nobbs noted his eyes were bloodshot and his face completely red, Nilsen had exclaimed, [...] "God! You look bloody awful"! Nilsen then advised the youth to see a doctor. Nobbs had not reported the attack to police for fear of his sexuality being discovered. Contrary to the prosecution claims, the defence counsel asserted that Nobbs' testimony reflected Nilsen's rational self was unable to control his impulses. Moreover, the fact Nilsen had selected a university student as a potential victim was at odds with the prosecution's claim that Nilsen intentionally selected rootless individuals whose disappearance was unlikely to be noted.|$|E

5000|$|For many years, {{the only}} known print of <b>Wake</b> <b>in</b> Fright, found in Dublin, was {{considered}} of insufficient quality for transfer to DVD or videotape for commercial release. In response to this situation, <b>Wake</b> <b>in</b> Frights editor, Anthony Buckley, began to search in 1994 for a better-preserved copy of the film in an uncut state. Ten years later, in Pittsburgh, Buckley found the negatives of <b>Wake</b> <b>in</b> Fright in a shipping container labelled [...] "For Destruction". He rescued the material, which {{formed the basis for}} the film's painstaking 2009 restoration.
