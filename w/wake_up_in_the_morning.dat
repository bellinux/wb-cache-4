500|$|The {{title track}} of the album, [...] "International Velvet", {{featuring}} the line [...] "Every day when I wake up I thank the Lord I'm Welsh" [...] and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media. Matthews explained {{in an interview that}} she wanted to turn to invert the idea of being Welsh from an apparent negative into a positive, [...] "We're not seen to be very good at anything. Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and thank the Lord that I'm Welsh. Hopefully by now people realise that Wales is brimmed full of talent and we're great people with massive brains." [...] In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed [...] "International Velvet" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The album became the first to be released for Catatonia in the United States, but failed to chart. The Washington Post called it [...] "overlooked".|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} mini-studio, the attic {{contained}} two other rooms: a small guest bedroom and a games room used for recreation. Lennon {{filled it with}} three full sets of the model car racing game, Scalextric. When not in the attic, Lennon could usually {{be found in the}} sunroom watching television or reading newspapers. He would also walk in the garden with his black cat on his shoulder (he had ten cats in total). His drug intake, particularly LSD and hashish, but also amphetamine, was high for much of the time he lived at Kenwood. Drugs were taken there in the company of people such as Marianne Faithfull's ex-husband John Dunbar and art dealer Robert Fraser. At one stage, under the influence of transcendental meditation, Lennon renounced both meat-eating and drugs, and buried a huge quantity of LSD in the garden, which had been obtained by representatives of The Beatles at the Monterey Pop Festival from Augustus Stanley Owsley III. He later tried to find the LSD, but could not remember where he had buried it. Although none [...] of the lavish parties they had planned took place - which remained a source of disappointment to Cynthia - various guests (including Monkee Michael Nesmith and his wife Phyllis, Bob Dylan and Peter Cook) stayed or dined at the house, together with old friends like Ivan Vaughan and Shotton from Liverpool, or strangers Lennon had met at a party or nightclub, such as the Ad Lib. Cynthia and Lennon were beginning to lead separate lives by 1967, and it was not uncommon for Cynthia to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to find the house filled with people in various states of intoxication whom Lennon had met in clubs the night before. Large parts of the house were unused by the Lennons, and visitors remarked that there was frequently a strange atmosphere.|$|E

They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.|$|E

2500|$|Sellers was {{executed}} {{by lethal injection}} at 12:17a.m. on February 4, 1999. He spoke to his step-siblings, saying, [...] "All {{the people who are}} hating me right now and are here waiting to see me die, when you <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> you aren't going to feel any different. You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee. Set my spirit free that I might worship Thee." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hard {{all over}} just like that," [...] he went on. [...] "Now that's what I call clean. Every bit of flesh an' blood an' muscle is clean {{right down to}} the bones--and they're clean, too. No soap and water only on the skin, but clean all the way in. I tell you it feels clean.

60|$|The {{lights of}} Oakland had dwindled till they made only a hazy flare against the sky; {{but to the}} south the San Francisco lights, topping hills and sinking into valleys, {{stretched}} miles upon miles. Starting from the great ferry building, and passing on to Telegraph Hill, Joe was soon able to locate the principal places of the city. Somewhere over in that maze {{of light and shadow}} was the home of his father, and perhaps even now they were thinking and worrying about him; and over there Bessie was sleeping cozily, to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and wonder why her brother Joe did not come down to breakfast. Joe shivered. It was almost morning. Then slowly his head dropped over on 'Frisco Kid's shoulder and he was fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{as if it}} {{were some}} sort of fever to which you might {{conclude}} they were immune when they hadn't taken it for two years," [...] sighed Rilla. [...] "The danger is just as great and just as real as it was the first day they went into the trenches. I know this, and it tortures me every day. And yet I can't help hoping that since they've come this far unhurt they'll come through. Oh, Miss Oliver, {{what would it be like}} not to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> feeling afraid of the news the day would bring? I can't picture such a state of things somehow. And two years ago this morning I woke wondering what delightful gift the new day would give me.

6000|$|... "To this {{compromise}} the men agreed readily. Accordingly about half-an-hour later we struck our camp and started, and notwithstanding my aches and bruises, I {{do not think}} that I ever felt in better spirits in my life. It is something to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and remember that in the dead of the night, single-handed, one has given battle to and overthrown three of the largest elephants in Africa, slaying them with three bullets. Such a feat to my knowledge had never been done before, and on that particular morning I felt a very 'tall man of my hands' indeed. The only thing I feared was, that should I ever come to tell the story nobody would believe it, for when a strange tale is told by a hunter, people are apt to think it is necessarily a lie, instead of being only probably so.[*] ...|$|E
6000|$|The German laughed again. [...] "Oh, {{they know}} their business," [...] he answered. [...] "You have your glass of beer and go to bed, and when you <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> you find that war has been declared; and you keep your mouth shut--unless {{you want to be}} shot for a traitor. Not that it would have made much difference," [...] he added. [...] "I admit that. The ground had been too well prepared. England was envious of our trade. King Edward had been {{plotting}} our destruction. Our papers were full of translations from yours, talking about 'La Revanche!' We were told that you had been lending money to Russia to enable her to build railways, and that when they were complete France and Russia would fall upon us suddenly. 'The Fatherland in danger!' It may be lies or it may not; what is one to do? What would you have done--even if you could have done anything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Later.--I {{have kept}} my letter {{a day or}} two, {{thinking}} I might feel [...] in tune for writing you a better one and not sending this at all. [...] But alas I shall have to wait some time before I am like my old [...] self again, so I may as well let this go. You see I'm not in a [...] condition, mentally or physically, to take bright and healthy views [...] of life. But if you really care {{you may as well}} see this mood as [...] another, for heaven only knows when I shall get out of it. Can you [...] understand the utter weariness of thinking about one thing all the [...] time, so that when you <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> consciousness comes [...] back with a sigh of [...] "Oh yes, here it is again; another day of [...] doubting and worrying, hoping and fearing has begun." [...] If I don't [...] get any sleep at all, which is too frequently the case, the strain [...] is a [...] "leetle" [...] bit too hard, and I am sometimes tempted to take a [...] drop of [...] "pison" [...] to put me to sleep in earnest. That momentary [...] vision of redemption from thinking and striving, of a happy rest [...] this side of eternity, has vanished away again. I can't help it; [...] peaceful, desirable as it may be, the truth is that practically I [...] don't believe it. It was such a sudden thing, such an entire change [...] from anything that had ever come to me before, that it seemed [...] almost like an inspiration, and I waited, almost expecting it to [...] continue, to be permanent. But it doesn't stay, and so back swings [...] the universe to the old place--paganism, naturalism, or whatever [...] you call the belief whose watchword is [...] "God and our own soul." [...] And [...] who shall say there is not comfort in it? One at least feels that [...] here one breathes one's native air, welcoming back the old human [...] feeling, with its beautiful pride and its striving, its despair, [...] its mystery and its faith. Write to me and tell me whether, as one [...] goes on, one must still be tossed about more and more by these [...] conflicting feelings, or whether they finally settle themselves [...] quietly {{one way or the other}} and take only their proper share at [...] least of one's life. This day is like summer, but I should enjoy it [...] more if last night hadn't been quite the most unpleasant I ever [...] spent. I got so thoroughly tired about two in the morning that I [...] made up my mind in despair to give the morphine another trial, and [...] as one dose had no effect took two; the consequence of which is [...] that I feel as ill to-day as one could desire. I can tell you, sir, [...] you had better prize the gift of sleep as it deserves while you [...] have it. If I don't never write to you no more you'll know it's [...] because I really wish to treat you kindly. But one of these days [...] you'll get another kind of letter, brim-full perhaps with health [...] and happiness and thoroughly ashamed of my present self. I had a [...] long letter yesterday from Harry James at Florence--enjoying Italy [...] but homesick. Did you see those verses in the North American [...] translated from the Persian? Good-bye.|$|E
