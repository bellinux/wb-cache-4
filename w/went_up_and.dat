On the edges of town, some architects began exploring that style's Picturesque mode. A new row of townhouses at Washington Park <b>went</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> another Second Street row followed in 1855. The following year, St. John's Episcopal Church, at First and Liberty Streets, was the first use of that style for a city church.|$|E

But Weston refused to take the advice of doctors who declared that he would never walk again. Through a regime of physical conditioning and the use of leg braces and a cane, Weston learned how to walk (albeit with a pronounced limp).

The amount quarried was greatly reduced and experienced several fluctuations in output and changes in operators. The fortunes of the town also <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down with the marble fluctuation as reflected by the changes in population by climbing to 600 by 1926, 550 as 1930, then dropping to 175 by 1933 with a rise to 225 from 1939 and into 1941.|$|E
25|$|By 1894, the {{electric}} streetcar was in operation on Huntington Avenue. Builder-developers began cutting streets through the hillside farmland and building homes for commuters on Parker Hill Avenue, Hillside Street, and Alleghany Street. An excellent example from this era is the Timothy Hoxie House at 135 Hillside Street. A freestanding Italianate villa, {{it was built}} in 1854 across from its present location. The Hoxie family left Beacon Hill for pastoral Mission Hill. Single-family houses of this size are rare today in the area. Demand for housing <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> builders turned to building multifamily dwellings, generally constructed on smaller lots.|$|E

25|$|The Yemeni {{quality of}} life is {{affected}} by the civil war and have suffered enormous hardships. Although mines are banned by the government, the Houthi forces lie anti-personal mines in many parts of Yemen including Aden. Thousands of civilian are injured when they accidentally stepped on mines; many lose their legs and injure their eyes. In addition, the nine country coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched several airstrikes against the Houthi forces. However, strikes between 2015 and 2016 killed more than 1920 civilians and destroyed many civilian economics structures for good and food production, storage, and distribution. Factories ceased their production and thousands of people lost their job. Due to decreased production, food, medicines, and other consumer staples became scarce.

25|$|Five months later, the two {{met again}} in Biarritz in a regular season match. A massive fistfight, in which almost all players were {{involved}} broke out after just 5 minutes, after a scrum <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the first rows exploded. The referee handed two yellows and two reds to Stade's Arnaud Marchois and BO's Imanol Harinordoquy. The rest was extremely rough, full of scuffles and insults. Stade {{went on to win}} 14–7. As can be expected, everyone condemned the other camp after the match. Biarritz coach Patrice Lagisquet assured Paris had assaulted his players to destabilise them, while the Parisians acknowledged that the overtime loss in the Top 14 final had been hard to swallow, especially as they had the impression that Biarritz had overemphasised the physical side. Ever since, the matches between the two teams have been relatively quiet.|$|E

The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00am. The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground. As they walked, some SS men <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.|$|E

That's why Niese hit him: He <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> in, and Heyward's a diver." [...] Indeed, charts from STATS LLC depicting Heyward's [...] "Hot Zones", or a hitter's zones of maximum effectiveness, corroborate the scout's findings. [...] Through April 25, 2014, Heyward had swung at 22 of 55 pitches in 2014 that qualified as [...] "up and in", crossing the plate either to the upper left ninth of the strike zone or slightly higher or inside of it.

The resulting exhaustingly brutal climb over rock and sage most likely contributed to the historic tragedy that befell the travelers three months and [...] to the west. When an advance team from the Latter-day Saint vanguard company came through, it chose to stick to the valley floor and hacked its way through to the bench overlooking the Great Salt Lake basin in less than four hours.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> up, and we've done {{a pretty good job of}} making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E

500|$|Fichtner {{said that}} his role on Prison Break ended up being [...] "a lot longer" [...] than he had {{originally}} thought. He was signed on to appear for a further two seasons, after being convinced by Olmstead to appear in a fourth (and final) one. The series' move from Dallas to Los Angeles for filming was also an inducement for Fichtner, who previously had to leave his family for filming. When Olmstead asked Fichtner to return for the fourth season, his only request was to make it challenging by making his character's journey difficult. Fichtner believes that in Mahone's journey, [...] "All {{of a sudden the}} blinders <b>went</b> <b>up...</b> <b>And</b> little by little, he's trying to make his way back."

500|$|At 21:00, a lone Japanese plane dropped eight bombs, cutting {{telephone}} wires. Once it had departed, yellow flares <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> a Japanese infantry {{attack was}} launched, supported by mortar fire. Offshore, Dechaineux' destroyers {{came under attack}} from four Betty bombers. 1st Squadron, 5th Cavalry, was attacked by about two reinforced platoons, which were met by heavy automatic weapons and mortar fire. The heavy jungle in this sector permitted some infiltration but the Japanese force was {{not strong enough to}} overrun the position. The main Japanese attack was delivered by 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment, {{from the direction of the}} native skidway, together with detachments from the Porlaka area, and fell on 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry. The troopers noticed a change in Japanese tactics. Instead of infiltrating silently, they advanced across the open, talking and in some cases singing. Their advance took them straight into anti-personnel mines and booby traps, which duly exploded, and then into the fields of fire of the Americans' automatic weapons, including several [...]30 water-cooled Browning machineguns, but the advance continued. The guns of the 211th Coast Artillery (AA) Battalion and 99th Field Artillery Battalion fired through the night, attempting to break up the Japanese attack from Porlaka. Shortly after midnight, Japanese barges attempted to cross Hyane harbour but were engaged by anti-aircraft guns and did not reach the American positions. A Bofors 40mm gun position was captured by the Japanese, who in turn were driven off by the Seabees. Manning the [...]30s, the 5thCavalry's gunners piled up the Japanese dead until the guns had to be moved to get clear fields of fire. One of the Browning guns that held the position was later left in its place, as a monument. Sergeant Troy McGill occupied a revetment with his squad of eight men. All were killed or wounded except McGill and another man, whom he ordered to fall back to the next revetment. McGill fired his rifle until it jammed, then clubbed the Japanese with it until he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
