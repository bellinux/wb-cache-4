Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> him?"

Can they be trained to maximise their potential? How can they best connect with the voters and issues of their time? These are the questions that Christina Dykes and Jo Silvester have attempted to answer in one of the first structured investigations to be conducted in this area. Their studies have employed concepts, techniques and approaches that have long been applied in business contexts to help identify and nurture commercial talent. Here they have begun to apply them to questions of political leadership and the results are enlightening, stimulating and, occasionally, surprising. The conclusions that the authors reach are broad in scope and supported by compelling evidence. They discuss the attributes that modern political leaders need to have to prove successful and how these can be identified in prospective candidates and nurtured during their formative years. This work explores {{the next step in the}} progress of parties as they adapt to function in modern democracies and highlights that once again the Conservative Party is in the vanguard of political progress...|$|R

But, Sir, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> that want of light in water baptism, or because a man hath been sprinkled, that he is to be kept dark in all other temple-institutions, till he be ashamed and repent of that? Pray produce the texts, for Ezekiel helps you nothing: he speaks only of the pattern of the house, the goings out, and comings in thereof. As for the coming in, you have already confessed, That baptism is not the entering ordinance. And as for the worship that Christ hath instituted in his church, as a church, I say, (and you also have said it) baptism is none of the forms thereof, none of the ordinances thereof, none of the laws thereof; for baptism is, as to the practice of it, that which is without the church, without the house of God.[6] Then by your own text, if a man do repent him of his christening in his childhood, he may be received into fellowship without submitting to baptism: but I will not strain you too far.|$|R
40|$|Background in Music Education. Musical {{structure}} {{is regarded as}} an integrated part of the music education curriculum. Nevertheless, understanding {{structure is}} generally considered a subject area for more advanced students, {{especially when it comes}} to complex pieces of music. From a pedagogical point of view, it is a basic assumption that the act of listening to music is linked to understanding music (Helms et al 1997). Thus, analysing the structure for its basic compounds and details is an important task during music lessons (Lemmermann 1978). Students can achieve this deductively (“Which instruments <b>do</b> <b>you</b> hear? <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> contrasts?”) or inductively (taking a detail as a starting point for more complex observations). Language is often considered an important medium to describe music. Therefore, many professionals try to teach a richer vocabulary to their students. Yet other means of analysing music exist: dance, acting, painting etc. (Colwell et al 2002). Repeated listening is the basis for a better understanding as well as the ability to actively listen to music. The latter is often in contrast to listening habits of students, as they would rather consume music than listen to it actively. Background in Musicology & Digital Design. A lively debate on music that describes non-musical contents began in the 18 th century and is continued until this day. Composers of programme music have traditionally had to stand harsh criticism of their work. “More an expression of perception than a painting”, states Beethoven beneath the first edition of his sixth symphony in an attempt to ensure that nobody interprets his symphony as “Malerei ” (Painting) ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{first thing}} I would remark on this (and I believe your Lordships have rather gone before {{me in the}} remark) is, that Mr. Hastings came down to Calcutta on the 5th of February; that then, or a few days after, he calls to him his {{confidential}} and faithful friend, (not his official secretary, for he trusted none of his regular secretaries with these transactions,)--he calls him to help him to make out his accounts during his absence. You would imagine that at that time he trusted this man with his account. No such thing: he goes on with the accountant-general, accounting with him for money expended, without ever explaining to that accountant-general how that money came into his hands. Here, then, we have the accountant making out the account, and the person accounting. The accountant does not in any manner make an objection, and say, [...] "Here you are giving me an account by which it appears that you have expended money, but you have not told me where you received it: how shall I make out a fair account of debtor and creditor {{between you and the}} Company?" [...] He does no such thing. There lies a suspicion in his breast that Mr. Hastings must have taken some money in some irregular way, or he could not have made those payments. Mr. Larkins begins to suspect him. [...] "Where did you lose this bodkin?" [...] said one lady to another, upon a certain occasion. [...] "Pray, Madam, <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> it?" [...] Mr. Hastings, at the very moment of his life when confidence was required, even when making up his accounts with his accountant, never told him one word of the matter. You see he had no confidence in Mr. Larkins. This makes out one of the propositions I want to impress upon your Lordships' minds, that no one man did he let into every part of his transactions: a material circumstance, which will help to lead your Lordships' judgment in forming your opinion upon many parts of this cause.|$|E

Perhaps <b>you</b> will say, I commit not my soul to their ministry, only hear them occasionally for trial. If this be all the respect thou hast for them and their ministry, thou mayest have as much for the worst that pisseth against the wall. But if thou canst hear them as God's ministers, and sit under their ministry as God's ordinance; then shew me where God hath such a gospel ministry, as that the persons ministering may not, though desiring it, be admitted with you to the closest communion of saints.
