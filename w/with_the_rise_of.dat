5|$|The {{emergence}} of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> various Hindu proselytizing movements such as Shuddhi (purification) and Sanghatan (consolidation) which launched massive {{efforts in the}} early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E

30|$|Meanwhile, the H 2 S partial {{pressure}} increases <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>of</b> absorption temperature at {{the conditions of}} a constant H 2 S loading and the same component concentrations of the aqueous absorption solution. The H 2 S loading in liquid phase decreases <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>of</b> absorption temperature under the same H 2 S {{partial pressure}} and the same component concentrations. These behaviors are the universal phenomena {{of the influence of}} temperature on the H 2 S partial pressure under the conditions of the constant H 2 S loading and the same component concentrations.|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters {{complaining about the}} inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were irrelevant {{to the business of}} selecting fiction.|$|E
5|$|British R {{continued}} to be played in the Northern Soul club scene, where early soul records, particularly those of Motown, were highly prized. There were also bands on the London pub rock circuit. Occasional R pub rock acts like Dr Feelgood managed to build a following through tireless touring. They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity (1976), but failed to make a significant impact in the US. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> disco music, British soul music became popular in the mid-late 1970s.|$|E

Coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> personal computers, computer ownership became mandatory for all students in 1997. In 1998, Georgia Tech was the first university in the Southeastern United States to provide its fraternity and sorority houses with internet access. A campus wireless network, the Local Area Wireless/Walkup Network (LAWN), was established in 1999; it now covers most of the campus.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, a reconstituted Blackstone Theatre Company {{managed the}} hall until 1948 when the Shubert Brothers bought the theatre. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> {{other forms of}} entertainment, such as television, {{attendance}} at live theaters declined and the Shubert Organization scaled back the Blackstone's season from 28 weeks to as few as 14 weeks each year.|$|E
5|$|In {{subsequent}} decades, republicanism would regain {{lost ground}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism. The Revolutions of 1848 were largely inspired by republicanism. Most of Europe's monarchies were abolished either during or following World War I or World War II, {{and the remaining}} monarchies were transformed into constitutional monarchies.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{the country}} music charts were {{dominated}} by pop singers with only tangential influences from country music, a trend that has continued since. The 1980s saw a revival of honky-tonk-style country <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> people like Dwight Yoakam and the new traditionalists Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs, {{as well as the}} development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo. Later alternative country performers, like Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams and Wilco, found some mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, many {{individuals}} with Down syndrome were institutionalized, {{few of the}} associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the eugenics movement, 33 of the then 48 U.S. states and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability. Action T4 in Nazi Germany made public policy of a program of systematic involuntary euthanization.|$|E

In 1980, astronomer Jack Robinson proposed that <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> azimuth <b>of</b> Fomalhaut was marked by cairn placements at both the Bighorn and Moose Mountain Medicine Wheels in Wyoming, USA and Saskatchewan, Canada, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> Pariou started <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Pariou, a strombolian cone where big explosions ejected {{trachytic}} products mixed to crystalline basement rubble.

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{philosophy}} and literature have contributed immensely {{to the religious}} and cultural landscape of Karnataka. Islam, which had an early presence {{on the west coast}} of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{was nearly}} wiped out twice; {{first in the}} 1920s <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> Communism due to the toy dog's {{traditional}} link to the aristocracy {{and again in the}} 1990s with the influx of foreign breeds following the fall of the Iron Curtain.

5|$|The life of Queen Catherine {{has been}} one of the most popular themes in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, {{attracting}} the attention of scholars from the neighbouring countries of Croatia and Serbia as well. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> ethnic nationalism, historians attempted to ascribe to her a particular national identity – Croat, Serb or Bosniak, which is completely anachronistic to medieval times.|$|E
5|$|The move to {{functional}} classification coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> sports science.

These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming. Henceforth sports science became the driver of both performance and classification.|$|E
5|$|The tulip was {{different}} from every other flower known to Europe at that time, with a saturated intense petal color that no other plant had. The appearance of the nonpareil tulip as a status symbol at this time coincides <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> newly independent Holland's trade fortunes. No longer the Spanish Netherlands, its economic resources could now be channeled into commerce and the country embarked on its Golden Age.
