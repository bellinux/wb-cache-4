5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E
5|$|The British {{flotilla}} arrived off {{the independent}} town of Ras al-Khaimah on 11 November, discovering Minerva and {{a fleet of}} dhows in the harbour. The pirate fleet initially sailed out to attack the British but retreated once {{the size of the}} expeditionary force became clear. Minerva failed to make the return to port successfully and was wrecked on a sandbank, the crew setting fire to their ship to prevent her seizure by boats launched from Chiffone. Onshore, the Al Qasimi and their Bedouin allies (whose numbers are unknown, but <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> than 20,000) formed a series of emplaced defences around the town that were protected from offshore bombardment by sandbanks which blocked the approach of Wainwright's heavier warships. On 12 November, Wainwright deployed his smaller ships close inshore to bombard the town and provide cover for his troop dispositions offshore.|$|E
5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west. They kept control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E

5|$|Anglo-Norman warfare {{during the}} reign of Stephen was characterised by attritional {{military}} campaigns, in which commanders tried to seize key enemy castles in order to allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory and ultimately win a slow, strategic victory. The armies of the period centred on bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry and crossbowmen. These forces were either feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign, or, increasingly, mercenaries, who were expensive but more flexible and often more skilled. These armies, however, were ill-suited to besieging castles, whether the older motte-and-bailey designs or the newer, stone-built keeps. Existing siege engines <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> powerful than the later trebuchet designs, giving defenders a substantial advantage over attackers. As a result, slow sieges to starve defenders out, or mining operations to undermine walls, tended to be preferred by commanders over direct assaults. Occasionally pitched battles were fought between armies but these were considered highly risky endeavours and were usually avoided by prudent commanders. The cost of warfare had risen considerably {{in the first part of}} the 12th century, and adequate supplies of ready cash were increasingly proving important in the success of campaigns.|$|E

Most of his designs used an unstiffened bridge deck, before it became clear that this form was vulnerable to wind forces and unstable under concentrated loads. His designs were reviewed by eminent engineers including John Rennie and Thomas Telford, and generally approved. Brown's designs <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> conservative than his contemporaries, adopting a higher tensile strength for his iron chains.|$|E
25|$|Age {{of these}} units was {{significant}} for several reasons. All of the Phase I units were either built or under construction when the Clean Air Act of 1977 was enacted, and all but eight were built or under construction when the 1970 Act was enacted. Consequently, these units were built when labor costs <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> than in the 1990s, and they avoided major investments in pollution control equipment. In the 1990s, these units were often among the least expensive of any operated by their respective owners, in terms of cost per megawatt-hour of energy produced. Compared to other plants on a utility company system, these units provided incentives for their owners to maximize operating time, minimize downtime for repairs or retrofit, and minimize further capital investments in them.|$|E

25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability {{to find its}} {{way back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E
25|$|The Normans {{had first}} {{developed}} castles in the 10th and 11th centuries, and their occupation of England after 1066 had made {{extensive use of}} them. Most castles {{took the form of}} earthwork and timber motte-and-bailey or ringwork constructs; easily built with local labour and resources, these were resilient and easy to defend. The Anglo-Norman elite became adept at strategically placing these castles along rivers and valleys to control populations, trade and regions. In the decades before the civil war, some newer, stone-built keeps had begun to be introduced. Unlike the more traditional designs, these required expensive skilled labourers and could only be built slowly over many seasons. Although these square keeps would later prove to have vulnerabilities, the ballistae and mangonels used in the 1140s <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> powerful than the later trebuchet designs, giving defenders a substantial advantage over attackers. As a result, slow sieges to starve defenders out, or mining operations to undermine walls, tended to be preferred by commanders over direct assaults.|$|E

500|$|The {{issue of}} local {{historic}} districts {{and the impact}} on property values is a concern to many homeowners. The effects have been extensively studied using multiple methodologies including before-and-after analysis and evaluating comparable neighborhoods with and without local designation status. [...] Recent factual analysis has been conducted by independent researchers {{in a number of}} states, including New Jersey, Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Colorado, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, and elsewhere. As stated by economist Donovan Rypkema, [...] "the results of these studies are remarkably consistent: property values in local historic districts appreciate significantly faster than the market as a whole {{in the vast majority of}} cases and appreciate at rates equivalent to the market in the worst case. Simply put – historic districts enhance property values." [...] In a 2011 study Connecticut Local Historic Districts and Property Values, it was found that [...] "property values in every local historic district saw average increases in value ranging from 4% to over 19% per year." [...] Similarly, in New York City between 1980 and 2000, local historic district properties on a price per square foot basis increased in value significantly more than non-designated properties. [...] Equally important, local historic district property values were found to resist market downturns better than historic non-designated properties. [...] A recent study investigating the data on single-family residential mortgage foreclosures and comparable non-designated neighborhoods found that designated properties <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> likely to experience foreclosure. Local historic district designation has proven to protect property values from wild fluctuations and provides stability in the housing market.|$|E
