5|$|A {{significant}} benefit of Operation Dragoon {{was the use}} of the port facilities in Southern France, especially the large ports at Marseille and Toulon. After Operation Cobra and Operation Dragoon, the Allied advance slowed almost to a halt in September due to a critical lack of supplies. The ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of supplies were unloaded, which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> third of the Allied cargo shipped to the Western front.|$|E
5|$|Reyes and Doggett {{arrive in}} Novi {{and talk to}} Detective Van Allen (James McDonnell), who seems apathetic about the case. At the same time, Scully {{contacts}} Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several bodies in the 1960s that were skinned {{in a manner similar}} to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not pay much attention to the cases, emphasizing that there <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local butchery to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is skinned. In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died.|$|E
5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E

25|$|The Coliseum {{was also}} home to the USFL's Los Angeles Express between 1983 and 1985.

500|$|The {{beginning}} of set theory as {{a branch of}} mathematics is often marked by the publication of Cantor's 1874 paper, [...] "Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen" [...] ("On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers"). This paper {{was the first to}} provide a rigorous proof that there <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> kind of infinity. Previously, all infinite collections had been implicitly assumed to be equinumerous (that is, of [...] "the same size" [...] or having the same number of elements). Cantor proved that the collection of real numbers and the collection of positive integers are not equinumerous. In other words, the real numbers are not countable. His proof differs from diagonal argument that he gave in 1891. Cantor's article also contains a new method of constructing transcendental numbers. Transcendental numbers were first constructed by Joseph Liouville in 1844.|$|E

500|$|Athens is the {{city-state}} that is best documented, both {{in terms}} of epikleroi and in all aspects of legal history. Athenian law on epikleroi was attributed to Solon; women with no brothers had to marry their nearest male relative on their paternal side of the family, starting with their father's brother and moving from there to the next nearest male relative on the paternal side. The historian John Gould notes that the order of relatives that were required to marry the epikleros coincided with the relatives required to avenge a murder. This set of relatives was known as the anchisteia (...) in Athens. The anchisteia was also the group of relatives who would inherit property in the absence of legal heirs. If there <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> possible spouse in a set of relatives, the right to marry the epikleros went to the eldest one. The property that was inherited could also be in debt, which would not affect the epikleros status.|$|E
500|$|During Lax's time at Cambridge: [...] "the mathematicians {{were in the}} saddle, and {{it would}} be {{difficult}} to dispute the judgement that they controlled Cambridge studies almost as completely as the logicians had done in the Middle Ages." [...] In early nineteenth century Cambridge [...] "the discipline of mathematics was at the very heart". Newtonian mathematics teaching as exemplified by [...] "Cambridge traditionalists" [...] such as Lax and his generation began to wane as the Georgian era drew to a close. In 1817 George Peacock successfully introduced the new French mathematics (such as Pierre-Simon Laplace and Joseph Louis Lagrange) into the Senate House Examinations. Peacock reported to Herschel, [...] "The introduction of d's into the papers excited much remark. Wood, Vince, Lax & Milner were very angry & threatened to protest against [...] French mathematics." [...] For the traditionalists the struggle <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> of intellectual difference as for them, [...] "Newton's rational mechanics, fluxions, and experimental philosophy were an excellent antidote against materialism and atheism." [...] However, from 1816 to 1824 Lax continued to sit on the Peacock-led board that established Cambridge Observatory.|$|E
500|$|Thrud the Barbarian {{was one of}} {{the best}} loved pieces in White Dwarf over the five years that the strip ran, being voted [...] "Most popular feature" [...] for three {{consecutive}} years during the magazine's golden age. Long-term fans of Thrud were excited and nostalgic to see him return in his own full-length comic, but were concerned that the idea would not stretch to 24pages. In reviewing issue 1, Jez Higgins, writing on TRS2, and Robert Clark of Strike to Stun, considered the comic a success that <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> joke spread thin and which was not limited by the single page brevity of the original strip. Steven Maxwell of Bulletproof Comics, however, found that what worked well within the constraints of a single page seemed stretched when spun out over 24. Issue 2 received similarly mixed reviews, with Clark criticising the comic for being much the same, with the same themes and joke as issue 1 while Glenn Carter of Comics Bulletin found it to be well written light reading with quite a few elements of humour. Overall, the comic was deemed a success, with even the more negative reviewers awarding it 6 out of 10 and looking forward to more issues.|$|E

500|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} {{practice}} session on Friday evening. His time of 1:31.001 <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> and a half seconds faster than the pole position time in the previous year's event. Lewis Hamilton finished second fastest, 0.241 seconds adrift of Rosberg. Jenson Button set the third fastest time for McLaren, although {{he was more than}} a second off the fastest time. Several drivers voiced surprise over McLaren's pace during Friday's practice sessions, described by Button as the team's best [...] "for a couple of years". Max Verstappen followed in fourth, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Räikkönen and Vettel. The latter had set the third-fastest time on the soft tyre compound, but mistakes during his runs on the super-soft tyres meant that he was unable to place higher than sixth. He had to end his session fifteen minutes early when his rear-left wheel nut came loose. Vandoorne was eleventh fastest in his second session, while Sergio Pérez, who took back the car from Celis, was fifteenth, two places ahead of his teammate Nico Hülkenberg. Vibrations from running over the kerbs caused the front wing on Romain Grosjean's car to dislodge, forcing him off track. He was able {{to get back into the}} pitlane and had the wing replaced. At the end of the session, Renault's Kevin Magnussen failed to stop for weighing, instead returning to his garage, where work was conducted on his car. As a consequence, he was forced to start the race from the pitlane.|$|E
