The film was originally scheduled to have a limited release in the United States on March 21, with a wide release following on March 28, 2014; however, the limited release date was later shifted by a week to March 14, 2014 with an expansion on March 21 and the planned wide release on March 28.|$|E
5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed <b>words</b> <b>had</b> {{been added to the}} notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985, the latter read out to the jury as statements H to N.

5|$|The Garden of Words premiered at the Gold Coast Film Festival in Australia on April 28, 2013 and had {{its general}} release on May 31, 2013 in Japan. For the Japanese premiere, {{the film was}} {{screened}} with an animated short called , also directed by Shinkai. The Garden of <b>Words</b> <b>had</b> an unusual release schedule since it was released digitally on iTunes {{the same day as}} the Japanese theatrical premier, and its DVD and Blu-ray were released while the film was still in theaters, on June 21. The film has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Anime Limited in the UK, and Madman Entertainment in Australia. The film performed well in theaters {{for an extended period of}} time and was hosted at many local and international film events. It ranked highly on iTunes Store during 2013 and was selected as the Year's Best Animation in iTunes' Best of 2013. It won the 2013 Kobe Theatrical Film Award and awards at the Fantasia International Film Festival and the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film.

5|$|Some {{versions}} of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex with Nephthys, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written <b>words</b> <b>had</b> the power to affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris's death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though {{the bulk of the}} traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set {{takes the form of a}} wild animal, such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris's corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred. Even the identity of the victim is changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris's son by Isis.|$|E

25|$|According to Spanish philologist and dialectologist Manuel Alvar López, alfajor is an Andalusian {{variant of}} the Castilian alajú, derived from the Arabic word الفاخر, al- fakhur, which was neither known nor found in the Americas, where Andalusians {{introduced}} it as alfajor, from the Arabic word alfahua that means honeycomb.

25|$|A chinjugami is the tutelary kami of a {{specific}} area or building, as for example a village or a Buddhist temple.

While the first refers to a clan's ancestor and the second to the tutelary kami of one's birthplace, chinjugami is the tutelary kami of a given place, highly respected and venerated.

50|$|Nunberg {{examines}} how {{the meaning of}} particular <b>words</b> <b>has</b> changed, indicating shifts in societal values.

25|$|The Koine Greek terms {{used in the}} New Testament of the {{structure}} on which Jesus died are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον).
