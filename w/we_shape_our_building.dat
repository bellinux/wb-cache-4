40|$|<b>We</b> <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> <b>buildings</b> and afterwards, <b>our</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>shape</b> us,” is a quote by W. Churchill that {{illustrates}} {{the importance of}} the person – environment – well being relationship. Although there is no environmental determinism, our surrounding {{is an important factor in}} the way we feel and perform in build spaces. Environmental psychology developed numerous tools for analysing and evaluating these influences. Not all of these findings come to the attention of architects or designers or people in charge of public buildings (schools, health institutions, etc). The paper exposes some of the environmental psychology recommendations (importance of light, presence of nature) that can influence our behaviour and that we are usually not aware of. Apart from contemporary research there are some traditional arts that bring the spiritual dimension to the design of the built environment. The paper presents Chinese feng shui, as an example of design approach, which uses the manipulation of life force qi for a more supportive living environment. Finally the project of the Vital house is shown as an example of successful combination of contemporary and traditional approaches...|$|R
40|$|On October 28 th 1943 Winston Churchill said <b>we</b> <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> <b>buildings,</b> and {{afterwards}} <b>our</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>shape</b> us (Humes, 1994). Churchill was pondering {{how and when}} to rebuild the British House of Commons, which had been destroyed by enemy bombs on May 10 th 1941. The old House had been small and insufficient to hold all its members, but was restored to its original form in 1950 in order to recapture the convenience and dignity that the building had shaped into its parliamentary members. The circular loop whereby buildings or dwellings are shaped and go on to shape those that reside in them is also true of pathogens and their hosts. As obligate parasites, pathogens need to alter their cellular host environments to ensure survival. Typically pathogens modify cellular transcription profiles and in doing so, the pathogen in turn is affected, thereby closing the loop. As key orchestrators of gene expression, noncoding RNAs provide a vast and extremely precise set of tools for pathogens to target in order to shape the cellular environment. This review will focus on host noncoding RNAs that are manipulated by the infamous intracellular pathogen, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). We will briefly describe both short and long host noncoding RNAs and discuss how HIV gains control of these factors to ensure widespread dissemination throughout the host as well as the establishment of lifelong, chronic infection...|$|R

"Thesis advisor: Professor Richard Wilson. As we e-mail, text, and Tweet, mobile technology is redefining the boundaries between absence and presence, as well as private and public. Technology allows us to control how we present ourselves and where we put our attention. However, these devices also seem to have control over us: our bodies, our communities, and our relationships. Winston Churchill once said, <b>we</b> <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> <b>buildings,</b> which in turn shape us. The {{same can be said}} of our mobile technologies. Smart phones are changing our lives, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse, and sometimes without us realizing it. I believe we can influence the development and deployment of technology if we are mindful and aware of what the media has to offer and what the consequences may be. This body of work examines the physical and psychological shaping that is occurring as we integrate mobile devices into our lives. In this paper, we will thoughtfully consider how mobile technology has become a poignant player in our connections and daily rituals. My intention is not to deter people away from their devices; this work is not an attack on mobile technology. Rather, it asks the reader to reflect on his or her own habits. I am asking users to develop a more self-aware, examined relationship with their smart phones. I hope that through this examination, users will begin to ask questions about what is most sustaining in human relationships and customs. Includes bibliographical references (pages 70 - 74) ...|$|R
40|$|Numbers have immeasurably {{altered the}} {{character}} of American society,” wrote Patricia Cohen in 1982 in the concluding pages of her book A Calculating People. Cohen continues, “Our modern reliance on numbers and quantification was born and nurtured in the scientific and commercial worlds {{of the seventeenth century}} and grew in scope in the early nineteenth century, under the twin impacts of republican ideology and economic development. ” In the two decades since Cohen’s book, reliance on numbers and quantification has increased well beyond what could have been imagined, and no end is in sight. Quantification emerged in seventeenth-century Western Europe as an alter-native to the classical Aristotelian systems of classification as a way {{to make sense of the}} world [Crosby 1997]. England was becoming a commercial capital and numbers were needed to describe the economy. Arabic numerals finally had been adopted and the first books on arithmetic had appeared. Education in arithmetic was beginning but was an arcane subject, cut into small bits, and not easy to learn. Arithmetic as a commercial subject was disconnected from formal mathematics [Cohen 1982]. To a larger extent than I believe healthy, both these circumstances still exist today. Inherent demands of a democracy, a large diverse country, and persistently aggressive economic development have fed the historical inclination of U. S. culture toward quantification to its enormity of today. Characteristics of the U. S. democracy that increase need for quantitative reasoning include: Constitutional mandate for a census. Protection of diverse and minority interests. Informing political debate. Confirming national identity. 113 114 BERNARD L. MADISON Free market system with minimally regulated labor markets.

40|$|Atmosphere, the {{pervasive}} yet elusive soft space that resonates with our senses, {{is known to}} effect the way we feel about a space, the self and others. Winston Churchill famously observed ‘we <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> <b>buildings,</b> and afterwards, <b>our</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>shape</b> us’. Yet, despite a recognised influence on everyday lives, Boch (2014) reminds us that this phenomenon isn't always consciously recognised and {{we may not be}} aware of the positive or negative impact the built environment has on us. So it becomes pertinent to investigate atmosphere in order to better understand the correspondence between spaces and people. The More London Estates in London, UK, is an example of uncompromising design where the spectacle of architecture and the culture of an ideology appear to shape human experiences. It offers a distinctive atmospheric encounter and this project puts forward a set of evaluative methods to investigate how design decisions within the site contribute to the formation of atmosphere and how atmosphere affects behaviour. The interest of the fieldwork, situated at the boundaries between spatial and ethnographic practices, lies in its ability to illustrate the elusive, to delineate atmospheric conditions and corresponding behavioural culture...|$|R
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>shape</b> <b>our</b> buildings: {{thereafter}} they shape us. ” (Churchill 1940, {{cited in}} McLuhan 1995, p. 62) In the same manner; <b>we</b> have <b>shaped</b> <b>our</b> cities, and accordingly they have <b>shaped</b> <b>our</b> lifestyles into bustling hubs of activity. Networks of roads and trails direct movement with dense high rise structures defining space. The Interior Architect enters this complex scene {{to become part}} of a duet rather than a solo, working within existing structural skins and initiating harmony between the desired new and the existing. The aim is to restore a “sense of place” within the existing city fabric through processes of restoration, renovation, preservation and adaptive re-use, extending a building’s lifetime, while preserving its history and character. The objective of this thesis is to propose a way of improving the experience of the public domain within the inner city of Pretoria. A series of communal spaces is proposed that will provide essential public amenities within the city. These interventions guide experience via the senses. The partially abandoned Transvaal Provincial Administration (TPA) building is selected as study area. The intervention is proposed to enable the building to realise a new era in its lifetime by acknowledging it and celebrating it as a modern icon within Pretoria’s Central Business District (CBD) while, at the same time, helping it to shed itself of its negative political association. This is proposed through the adaptive re-use of the structure to accommodate various functions including a conference facility and a new home for Pretoria’s Art Association.
