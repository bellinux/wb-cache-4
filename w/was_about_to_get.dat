U-boats {{could operate}} from French Atlantic ports, {{reducing}} {{their need to}} make the dangerous journey from ports in Norway or Germany around Scotland, and increasing their operational range in the ocean by several hundred miles. The Luftwaffe with its small, but valuable fleet of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors, could now operate from the same area. From June 1940 onwards, the Battle of the Atlantic began in earnest.|$|E

Seeing that his prey <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away, Arima gave chase in a flotilla led by a huge tower-junk. This junk was built by lashing two large boats together, upon which a wooden siege tower as tall as the carrack's deck was erected. The tower was covered with wet hides to protect it against Portuguese fire, and had openings for the 500 archers and musketeers inside to shoot out of. With a total of around 3000 samurai due to reinforcements in the last three days, the flotilla tried to approach the carrack under the cover of the tower-junk.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, after returning from Monaco with a silver medal of the 1939 International University Games Baworowski was residing in Paris where his family lived. When he heard about {{the outbreak}} of the war he was determined to join the Polish army although his parents begged him to stay. When he arrived to the East Railway Station of Warsaw, The German Luftwaffe was already bombarding the area. The passengers fled from the trains to nearby trenches. Apparently he was successfully enlisted. The next time he met his cousin Eugene Paul Baworowski in the streets of Warsaw in the first days of occupation he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in touch with the Polish Resistance. As the 6 September 1939 decree issued by the Wehrmacht command pursued every Polish citizen who reached the military age to be sent to a POW camp the Gestapo soon arrested and sent him to a camp. Only his ties to the Chorynsky noble family and to the former Austrian Tennis Federation saved him from further reprisals.|$|E
25|$|Local traditions {{states that}} when the village was still called Benquerença, there was a {{beautiful}} orphan princess who lived in her uncle, {{the lord of the}} castle. The princess {{fell in love with a}} noble young knight who did not possess great wealth. For this reason, the young man left the village in search of fortune, promising to return when he felt he had a worthy fortune to ask for her hand. For years, the princess refused all suitors, until her uncle promised her to a friend, forcing her to compromise. When she was presented to the uncle of her suitor, she confessed that her heart belonged to another man. This revelation infuriated her uncle, who thought of a ruse to coerce her to marry the one he chose. At night, he disguised as a ghost, and went through the ports of the Princess quarters, pretending to be the ghost of her lover, telling her to marr her suitor or otherwise be subject to damnation. As he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an oath from her, the door to her bedroom opened with a bright ray of light, exposing her uncle's treachery. She went to live in the tower and the two windows became known as the Port of Treason and the Port of Light.|$|E
500|$|Chris Morgan {{would return}} to write the sequel's screenplay, but {{departed}} in April 2009 due to [...] "excessive workload", leaving the task to Evan Spiliotopoulos. In June 2009, Bekmambetov said that pre-production for Wanted 2 <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started, with filming scheduled to begin in late fall or winter. The film will have a reported budget of $150million and will be shot in the United States, India, and Russia. He also added {{that some of the}} characters would resurrect, particularly Fox and The Exterminator. On September, the director added that even without a finished script Bazelevs had already done previsualization of the action scenes. In 2010, after reports that Angelina Jolie had pulled out of the sequel, Millar said that the script would be rewritten to remove Fox's return, so production could start that year for a late 2011 release. Eventually the production did not take off, leading Bekmambetov to work on [...] instead.|$|E

500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E

2500|$|By 937, it was {{becoming}} clear that Xu <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Yang Pu to yield the throne to him, as he, who by that point had been created the Prince of Qi, was taking on imperial trappings. [...] Yang Meng decided to take one final attempt to stop the transition. [...] In fall 937, he assassinated Wang Hong, and when Wang Hong's son led the guards to try to attack him, he killed Wang Hong's son with an arrow. [...] He took two guards who were loyal to him and fled to Lu Prefecture (廬州, in modern Hefei, Anhui), as Zhou Ben the military governor of Desheng Circuit (德勝, headquartered at Lu Prefecture) was a senior general who had served under Yang Xingmi, and Yang Meng was hopeful that he might support Yang Meng's efforts. [...] When he arrived at Lu Prefecture, however, Zhou's son Zhou Hongzuo (周弘祚) closed off the mansion and did not allow Zhou Ben to see Yang Meng, while sending guards out to capture Yang Meng. [...] He then delivered Yang Meng toward Guangling, but Xu sent an imperial messenger with an edict in Yang Pu's name, intercepted Yang Meng at Caishi (采石, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui), and killed him there.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, McPherson sent a note back to Grant {{stating that}} he had been engaged with a Confederate force of about 1,000 men for two hours and <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the upper hand. This was an {{incredibly}} accurate statement. [...] So far, the Confederates had only managed to commit the 7th Texas and 3rd Tennessee Infantry Regiments, just under 1,000 men in total. [...] Strangely enough, the Confederates engaged now found themselves caught in the same trap that they had planned for the Federals: they had been lured in a disorganized mass across a nearly impassable creek, and now faced the danger of being driven into the creek and slaughtered. [...] The enfilading fire on the 3rd Tennessee began to take its toll, and the its left flank crumbled. [...] Col. Hiram Granbury of the 7th Texas decided to order a withdrawal, then had second thoughts and sent a courier to his right battalion with a message to rescind the order. [...] A timely bullet killed the courier before he could deliver the message, meaning that for a few valuable minutes five companies of the 7th Texas regiment were holding back an entire Federal army division. [...] This allowed hundreds of Confederates to withdraw safely across the creek. [...] A final push by the fresh 8th Illinois Infantry regiment finally broke the 7th Texas. [...] A proud veteran regiment that had once boasted that it had never been broken in battle was now reduced to fleeing for its life in scattered groups, with hundreds of Federals in pursuit.|$|E
