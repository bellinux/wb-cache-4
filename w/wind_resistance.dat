5|$|Tennis for Two is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} in 1958, which simulates {{a game of}} tennis, {{and was one of}} the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with <b>wind</b> <b>resistance.</b> He designed the game, displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers, in a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over three weeks. The game's visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing a button.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing <b>wind</b> <b>resistance</b> was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E

The nonlinear simulation model of airflow is established under the Simulink platform of Matlab according to the nonlinear equations.

The results show that the break of <b>wind</b> <b>resistances</b> has no great influence on the distribution of airflow in ventilation network. But the values of the <b>wind</b> <b>resistances</b> affect significantly the distribution of airflow in the ventilation network, indicating that if the increase of <b>wind</b> <b>resistances</b> on the non-diagonal branch could result in the decrease of time for airflow stability and of airflow volume on other breaches of the same passageway...|$|R

25|$|Any solid object {{produces}} a wake behind it, leading to fatigue failures, so the turbine is usually positioned upwind of its supporting tower. Downwind machines have been built, because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them {{in line with}} the wind. In high winds, the blades can also be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their <b>wind</b> <b>resistance.</b> In upwind designs, turbine blades must be made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds. Additionally, the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted forward into the wind a small amount.|$|E

One indicator of temperature in a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is the stator <b>winding</b> <b>resistance.</b> Detection of PMSM <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> {{in the literature}} has been made on machines with relatively high resistances, where the resistive voltage vector is significant under load. This paper describes two techniques which {{can be applied to}} detect the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance,</b> through ‘Fixed Angle’ and ‘Fixed Mag- nitude’ current injection. Two further methods are described which discriminate injected current and voltages from motoring currents and voltages: ‘Unipolar’ and ‘Bipolar’ separation.

These methods can be applied under load, and in a manner that does not disturb motor torque or speed.

25|$|Airy was {{consulted}} about wind {{speeds and}} pressures {{likely to be}} encountered on the proposed Forth suspension bridge being designed by Thomas Bouch for the North British Railway in the late 1870s. He thought that pressures no greater than about 10 pounds per square foot could be expected, a comment Bouch took to mean also applied to the first Tay railway bridge then being built. Much greater pressures, however, can be expected in severe storms. Airy was called to give evidence before the Official Inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster, and was criticised for his advice.

25|$|The Roussanne vine ripens {{late and}} is {{characterized}} by its irregular yields that can decrease further due to poor <b>wind</b> <b>resistance.</b> The vine is also susceptible to powdery mildew and rot {{which makes it a}} difficult vine to cultivate. In recent years, the development of better clones has alleviated some of these difficulties. The grape prefers a long growing season but should be harvested before the potential alcohol reaches 14% which would result in the finished wine being out of balance. If picked too soon, the grape can suffer from high acidity. During winemaking, Roussanne is prone to oxidation without care being taken by the winemaker. The wine can benefit from a controlled use of oak. In blends, Roussanne adds aromatics, elegance and acidity with the potential to age and further develop in the bottle.|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch next {{tackled the}} record for one mile on a half-mile track. Because the horse must {{negotiate}} more and tighter turns on a smaller track, the half-mile track record is slower than the time on a one-mile track. Even today, separate records are kept in harness racing depending on the track dimensions. On September 7 at the half-mile track in Lima, Ohio, Dan Patch paced a world record of 2:04, {{only to have the}} record broken by Prince Alert a few weeks later. Prince Alert then lowered the world record on a one-mile track to an astonishing 1:57, thanks in part to perfect weather conditions but also aided by a large canvas sail carried between the galloping horses who set the pace. Critics pointed out that the sail, later referred to as a wind shield, lessened the <b>wind</b> <b>resistance</b> that a horse faced (similar to drafting in cycling or motor racing). Although the usage of wind shields was eventually disallowed by the American Trotting Register, in the short term it meant that Dan Patch was no longer the fastest horse in the world.|$|E

The quality factor (or Q) of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and {{is a measure of}} its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal, lossless, inductor. High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and receivers. The higher the Q is, the narrower the bandwidth of the resonant circuit.|$|R

This paper investigates the influence of nonideal voltage measurements on the parameter estimation of permanentmagnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). The influence of nonideal voltage measurements, such as the dc bus voltage drop, zero shift in the amplifier, and voltage source inverter nonlinearities, on the estimation of different machine parameters is investigated by theoretical and experimental analysis. For analysis, a model-reference-adaptive-system-based estimator is first described for the parameter estimation of the q-axis inductance, stator <b>winding</b> <b>resistance,</b> and rotor flux linkage. The estimator is then applied to a prototype surface-mounted PMSM to investigate the influence of nonideal voltage measurement on the estimation of various machine parameter values. It shows that, at low speed, the inverter nonlinearity compensation has significant influence on both the rotor flux linkage and <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> estimations while, at high speed, it has significant influence only on the <b>winding</b> <b>resistance</b> estimation and has negligible influence on the rotor flux linkage estimation. In addition, the inverter nonlinearity compensation will not influence the q-axis inductance estimation when it is under id = 0 control. However, the dc bus voltage drop due to the load variation and zero shift in the amplifier will significantly influence the q-axis inductance estimation. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
