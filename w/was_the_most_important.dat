5|$|In the southeast, Copán <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> city. Its Classic-period dynasty {{was founded}} in 426 by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. The new king had strong ties with central Petén and Teotihuacan. Copán reached the height of its {{cultural}} and artistic development during the rule of Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who ruled from 695 to 738. His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal, king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá. The captured lord of Copán was taken back to Quiriguá and was decapitated in a public ritual. It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul, in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal. Palenque and Yaxchilan were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region. In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by 300.

The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E

5|$|Depicted in {{the mosaic}} Map of Madaba of 600, Gaza <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{political}} and commercial {{center on the}} southern coast of Palestine.

The towns of Bethelea, Asalea, Gerarit and Kissufim were included in Gaza's territories. Its large representation, approximately half of which is preserved, cannot be easily explained, mainly because only small tentative excavations have been made there and because Byzantine Gaza is covered by the still inhabited Old City.|$|E

He also made a statement on why he felt he was the best choice for president and why he should receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E

After a refit, which included the replacement of some of her weapons and the shortening of her mainmast and funnels, she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Premuda. In Italian service she was mainly used as an escort and troop transport.

Apart from the archaeological evidence, this is also attested in Hittite records, which indicate that Miletos (Milawata in Hittite) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> base for Mycenaean activity in Asia Minor.

The prime goal was co-operation with the Scandinavian countries, amongst which Sweden <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> prospective partner.|$|E

Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410.
