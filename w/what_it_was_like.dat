5|$|She wrote popular {{articles}} for newspapers, including an advice column for girls, describing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> {{to be an}} actress, and answering questions from readers. For adult readers, Michelena wrote other pieces such as {{a history of the}} moving picture industry. In 1920 when she stopped making films, she returned to her career as a singer.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. Vitti had wanted an episode centered on Mrs. Krabappel that examined <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> to have Bart as a student. It was the first episode of the show to feature her in a prominent role. The subplot where Homer tries to clean up his language was written partially {{in response to the}} complaints the show had been getting about the amount of cursing on the show. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image.|$|E
40|$|A {{widespread}} assumption {{in current}} philosophy of {{mind is that}} a conscious state’s phenomenal properties vary with its representational contents. In this paper, I present (rather dogmatically) an alternative picture that recognizes two kinds of phenomenal properties that do not vary concomitantly with content. First, it admits phenomenal properties that vary rather with attitude: <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> {{for me to see}} rain is phenomenally different from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to remember (indistinguishable) rain, which is different again form <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to visualize (indistinguishable) rain – where these differences cannot be traced back to variations in content. Secondly, {{there is a kind of}} phenomenal property that varies neither with content nor with attitude but is altogether invariant across all conscious states: a substantive phenomenal commonality among <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to see, remember, and visualize rain, cats, or dogs. This substantive commonality, I will suggest, is the for-me-ness component of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to have any of these experiences. I will close by discussing the interrelations among these three concentric layers of phenomenality: content-based, attitude-based, and for-me-ness...|$|R

5000|$|The book closes with [...] "The Inner Eye", a {{collection}} of short pieces on the subjective nature of experience. How can one describe <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> another self? For that matter, what can we know about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> ourselves? Hofstadter and Dennett's commentary suggest that self-knowledge is elusive, {{to say nothing of the}} experience of other minds.|$|R
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, Wheeler and three of his {{batteries}} were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> for aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.|$|E

5000|$|Earl Conee {{objects that}} having {{an ability to}} imagine seeing a color is neither {{necessary}} nor sufficient for knowing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to see that color, meaning the ability hypothesis does not capture {{the nature of the}} new knowledge Mary acquires upon leaving the room. To show that ability is not necessary, Conee cites the example of someone who is able to see colors when she is looking at them, but who lacks the capacity to imagine colors when she is not. He argues that while staring at something that looks red to her, she would have knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to see red, even though she lacks the ability to imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like.</b> In order to show precisely that imaginative abilities are not sufficient for knowing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> Conee introduces the following example: Martha, [...] "who is highly skilled at visualizing an intermediate shade that she has not experienced between pairs of shades that she has experienced...happens not to have any familiarity with the shade known as cherry red". Martha has been told that cherry red is exactly midway between burgundy red and fire red (she has experienced these two shades of red, but not cherry). With this, Martha has the ability to imagine cherry red if she so chooses, but as long as she does not exercise this ability, to imagine cherry red, she does not know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to see cherry red.|$|R

25|$|Kilmer {{was married}} to actress Joanne Whalley from March 1988 to February 1996. The two met while working {{together}} on the film Willow. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mercedes (b. October 29, 1991), and a son, Jack (b. June 6, 1995). Warwick Davis, Kilmer's co-star from the 1988 fantasy Willow, in his audio commentary for the film said that the question he is most asked is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> working with Kilmer. Though Kilmer has a reputation of being difficult, Davis describes him as a very funny man and a hard working, dedicated actor.
