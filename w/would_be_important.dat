This would decrease communication distances that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> for computer-based societies as those described above.|$|E
5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} {{approached}} on 1 July 2008, Näslund {{made it clear}} that the style of play and the player personnel of a team <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> {{for the development}} of Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E

She took three years of Spanish ballet training and four years of theatre at Cristina Rota's New York school. She says that ballet instilled in her discipline that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in her future acting career. When she became a cinephile at 10 or 11, her father bought a Betamax machine, which was then a very rare thing to own in her neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds {{depends upon the}} needs of a specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, accrual basis accounting would be appropriate to show the fund's profitability. Accrual basis is also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the profitability of those investments <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which {{declared}} the arbitration agreement unconscionable under California law. That precluded arbitration proceedings and allowed Adams {{to pursue a}} regular lawsuit in California courts. Adams was then able to pursue the original claims notwithstanding the decision by Justice Kennedy. In {{the aftermath of the}} case, legal analysts said that this case <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> for future arbitration case law.|$|E

5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in establishing and funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one on the word, making the Bible, {{and the ability to}} read the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E
50|$|Syracuse {{was later}} {{extensively}} rebuilt and repopulated and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an <b>important</b> {{city for the}} Roman empire {{until well into the}} 5th century, playing both a military and economic part {{in the creation of the}} empire.|$|R

5|$|In 1962, Đính was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} III Corps, which oversaw the region surrounding the capital Saigon. He was given the post because Diệm regarded {{him as one of}} his most loyal officers. This position meant that Đính <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> to {{the success or failure of}} any coup. In late 1963, with Diệm becoming increasingly unpopular, Đính's colleagues recruited him into a coup by playing on his ego. They convinced him to ask Diệm for a cabinet post, knowing that the president was adamantly opposed to military officers serving as ministers and would chastise him. Diệm promptly rebuffed Đính, who became upset and was lured into the plot. Diệm and his brother and chief advisor Ngô Đình Nhu were aware of a coup plot, but did not know of Đính's involvement. Nhu planned a fake coup of his own in an attempt to trap his opponents and generate positive publicity for his family's regime. He put Đính in charge of the fake coup, and the general promptly redeployed loyal units outside Saigon and rebel forces near the capital. On 1 November 1963, the rebels' actual coup proceeded, and the Ngô brothers were deposed and executed.|$|E
5|$|Treloar's first {{challenge}} was {{to improve the quality}} of the war diaries kept by AIF units. These diaries were meant to be maintained by each element of the AIF as a record of its activities for later use by historians, but at the time most units recorded few details. To this end, Treloar met with many of the officers responsible for units' war diaries and frequently provided written advice and feedback on the quality of the records submitted to the Section; these methods had previously been used by the Canadian military. Treloar also sought to motivate relevant personnel by demonstrating that the diaries were valued and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in ensuring that their unit received recognition for its achievements after the war. In August 1917 the AWRS expanded its activities to include collecting artefacts from the French battlefields. Its tasks increased further in September when it took over responsibility for supervising the official war artists as well as producing and keeping records of non-official publications such as regimental magazines. Individual soldiers were encouraged to contribute artefacts and records, and the AWRS provided museum labels to combat units to encourage them to record the significance and origins of items they submitted. The AWRS established field offices in France and Egypt, and reached a strength of about 600 soldiers and civilians in November 1918. From November 1917 until August 1918 the war correspondent Henry Gullett commanded the AWRS subsection in Cairo; in this role he reported directly to Treloar. As a result of the AWRS' expansion, in March 1918 its headquarters moved from the PRO building to a larger office on Horseferry Road opposite the main offices of the AIF Administrative Headquarters.|$|E

25|$|The main Peruvian defense line {{ran from}} the seaside resort of Chorrillos through Morro Solar, Santa Teresa, San Juan, the Pamplona (hills) until Monterrico Chico, a line of defence {{approximately}} 15km long. Gatling guns, artillery, covering forts and trenches located {{along the top of}} the steeply natural hills (280 m in Morro Solar, 170 m in Sta. Teresa und San Juan) and minefields around the roads to Lima crossing the hamlets of San Juan and Santa Teresa – settlements the Peruvians anticipated <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> targets of the Chilean attack – were all utilised by the Peruvian military.|$|E
25|$|For {{the premiere}} of Theodor Körner at the Berlin Court Opera, Liszt began with the former artistic {{director}} Count von Redern. However, Count von Redern recommended Liszt to run the premiere on a different stage because Prince Louis Ferdinand was {{to play a role}} which would affect the Prussian royal family too strongly. For the premiere to be accommodated elsewhere it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> to gain Wagner's support, for whom Wendelin had fought for many years.

30|$|Another key {{challenge}} involves attaining predictable {{properties for}} nano-EOR process.

25|$|Braun and Gearhart {{note that}} {{although}} unions do {{participate in the}} structure of a number of these agreements, their original interest in codes of conduct differed from the interests of human rights and other non-governmental activists. Unions believed that codes of conduct <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> first steps in creating written principles that a company would be compelled to comply with in later organizing contracts, but did not foresee the establishment of monitoring systems such as the Fair Labor Association. These authors point out that are motivated by power, want to gain insider status politically and are accountable to a constituency that requires them to provide them with direct benefits.|$|E
25|$|In January 1967, after {{production}} of the Griffith had been discontinued, TVR unveiled the Tuscan V8, initially in short-wheelbase and then long-wheelbase configurations. It was first displayed at the Racing Car Show at Olympia, in London. The Tuscan did not provide the economic boost to TVR that the Lilleys had hoped, {{and it was only}} built in low volume. A Tuscan owned by racing driver John Burton was modified by race car mechanic Mike Bigland to improve the handling, and Bigland's success was noticed by Martin Lilley; this would {{be the beginning of a}} relationship that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in the development of the later M Series chassis.|$|E
25|$|Friedman {{realized}} that the new rotor machines <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important,</b> and devoted some time to analysing Hebern's design. Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features included having rotors step one position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that turns with every keypress) {{at either end of}} the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough ciphertext and applying a standard statistical method known as the kappa test, he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine.|$|E
