40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Dietary iodine {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the nutritional health of freshwater fish larvae. Artemia, commonly used for the culture of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), contain low concentrations of iodine when compared with wild zooplankton. Water-soluble micronutrients, such as iodine, are difficult to deliver to Artemia due to rapid diffusion from microparticles. Several methods have been developed to deliver water-soluble nutrients to live prey and are reviewed in this thesis. <b>Wax</b> <b>spray</b> beads (WSB) have been shown to retain greater than 50...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 In the wild, marine fish larvae feed on copepods {{and other}} planktonic organisms. Copepods are often {{considered}} the "gold standard" {{for meeting the}} nutritional needs of cultured marine fish larvae; however, in captivity, marine fish larvae are generally fed cultured live prey, i. e. rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) and/or Artemia sp., until they can be weaned onto artificial diets, which typically coincides {{with the end of}} the larval phase. Concentrations of certain water-soluble nutrients in rotifers and Artemia, notably taurine, may not be sufficient to meet the nutritional demands of some species of marine fish larvae. The delivery of low-molecular weight, water-soluble substances to aquatic organisms is challenging because these substances are rapidly lost from food particles when suspended in water, referred to as nutrient leaching. One solution to this problem is to encapsulate water-soluble substances within synthetic microparticles that are specifically designed to reduce nutrient leaching. Alternatively, water-soluble substances may be dissolved in the culture water of these organisms facilitating nutrient absorption or ingestion via drinking, hereafter referred to as the "dissolved method" of nutrient enrichment. In Chapter 2, I provide an overview of enrichment methods for cultured live prey and put particular emphasis on the enrichment of water-soluble compounds. In Chapters 3, 4 and 5, my co-authors and I evaluated the use of synthetic microparticles, liposomes and <b>wax</b> <b>spray</b> beads, for increasing the water-soluble nutrient concentrations (enrichment) of rotifers and Artemia with the intent to increase their nutritional quality for marine fish larvae. Furthermore, we compared microparticulate enrichment with dissolved methods whereby the nutrients were dissolved in the culture medium. Microparticle-enriched live prey were evaluated by: 1) using fluorescent techniques to investigate the ingestion and digestion of microparticles by live prey and 2) determining the growth performance of two species of marine fish larvae, northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra) and California yellowtail (CYT: Seriola lalandi) in response to different enrichment methods for the water-soluble nutrient, taurine. Taurine was used as a model nutrient because taurine concentrations are low in cultured live prey, especially when compared to copepods, and because its was believed to be a growth-limiting nutrient for marine fish larvae. Taurine concentrations in rotifers and Artemia enriched with taurine-containing microparticles could be increased to levels reported in copepods. In Chapters 3 and 4, we found that northern rock sole larvae grew significantly larger, were more developed and had higher whole body taurine concentrations when fed rotifers enriched with taurine-containing microparticles when compared to control treatments. In Chapter 5, we found that CYT larvae fed taurine enriched rotifers showed increased growth (final dry weights) and had higher whole body taurine concentrations when compared to larvae fed unenriched rotifers but these differences were not apparent in the subsequent Artemia phase, suggesting that unenriched Artemia had sufficient taurine concentrations to allow compensatory growth of CYT. Differences and similarities are discussed between the efficacy of liposomes and <b>wax</b> <b>spray</b> beads for rotifer enrichment and subsequent nutritional effects on fish larvae. Ultimately, this research provides the first evidence of positive growth effects of liposome- and <b>wax</b> <b>spray</b> bead-enriched live prey on marine fish larvae as a result of enhanced delivery of water-soluble nutrients. The outcomes of these findings suggest that microparticles may be used as a research tool to assess the water-soluble nutrient deficiencies of cultured live prey for marine fish larvae. Furthermore, with further development, these methods may have application for commercial hatcheries and could result in improved production efficiencies and cost savings for these operation...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{integrated approach}} to the testing and comparison of motorcycle drive chain lubricants is presented. This is a novel way of testing the lubrication by using loaded operating chains and sprockets. A test rig {{has been designed to}} operate chains and sprockets in a clean environment and allow direct comparison between different lubricants. The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties. The lubricants tested were a <b>wax</b> <b>spray,</b> PTFE spray and drip fed light oil. The test rig allowed measurement of the power saved by the lubricant in running the chains and sprockets. Chain length and component masses were also taken before and after running the chains and sprockets under load on the test rig. The results clearly show that any lubricant is preferable to none. The drip fed oil provided the greatest power saving and wear protection between the chain rollers and pins and the spray lubricants provided the highest level of protection between rollers and sprockets...|$|E

50|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) are released from many household cleaning {{products such as}} disinfectants, polishes, floor <b>waxes,</b> air-freshening <b>sprays,</b> all purpose cleaning sprays, and glass cleaner. These products {{have been shown to}} emit irritating vapors. VOCs are of most concern due to their tendency to evaporate and be inhaled into the lungs or adsorbed to existing dust, which can also be inhaled. It has been found that aerosolized (spray) cleaning products are important risk factors and may aggravate symptoms of adult asthma, respiratory irritation, childhood asthma, wheeze, bronchitis, and allergy.|$|R
50|$|Hair spray is {{a common}} {{household}} aqueous solution {{which is used to}} stiffen hair into a certain style. It was first developed and manufactured in 1948 by Chase Products, based in Broadview, Illinois. Weaker than hair gel or hair <b>wax,</b> it is <b>sprayed</b> directly onto the hair to hold styles for long periods of time. It sprays evenly over the hair using a pump or aerosol spray nozzle. The product may leave hair feeling 'crunchy' unless brushed out.|$|R
40|$|Commercial and locally {{extracted}} biorational pesticides {{were tested}} by leaf dipping against the Egyptian alfalfa weevil (EAW), Hypera brunneipennis (Boheman). They included BioNeem, horticultural spray oil, K + Neem, garlic barrier, hot pepper wax and cypermethrin 10 % EC, at the recommended rates. Water extracts of Calotropis procera latex, Azadirachta indica seeds and Citrullus colocynthis, {{in addition to}} methanol extracts of Solenostemma argel and Rhazya stricta, at rates 0. 1 - 2. 0 %. Spray oil, C. procera and cypermethrin were the only pesticides that significantly caused mortality consistently. The smallest leaf area consumed by EAW larvae was in leaves treated with neem seeds, C. procera latex, hot pepper <b>wax,</b> S. argel, <b>spray</b> oil and R. stricta. No mortality was observed, in all experiments, in neem seeds, S. argel, R. stricta and hot pepper wax. Bioneem, C. procera, Spray Oil and Cypermethrin were very effective in both inhibition of feeding and causing mortality of larvae. Garlic barrier and C. colocynthis stimulated feeding more than the control...|$|R
5000|$|Protective {{elements}} for bronze fountains are particularly important, since water {{is one of}} the leading causes for alterations or corrosion in a bronze. [...] Bronze sculptures incorporated in fountains will need more layers of <b>wax,</b> because the <b>spray</b> of water will cause deterioration of the wax at a faster pace than would normally happen. Different aspects of the water need to be monitored, including but not limited to pH, total alkalinity, and hardness or level of dissolved mineral salts. There is a chance that the water will leave mineral deposits in a white/tan crust-like fashion. That “crust” can cause damage or become more permanent if it comes in contact with the metal surface or a patina and needs to be periodically removed. There are different chemical treatments that can be used to control the levels of these factors. Usually the maintenance of fountains has to occur at a more frequent rate than other bronze sculptures as well.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory and {{greenhouse}} {{studies were}} conducted to examine the leaf surface, epicuticular <b>wax</b> content, <b>spray</b> droplet behavior, and primisulfuron activity (with and without surfactants) on common lambsquarters, common purslane, velvetleaf, barnyardgrass, and green foxtail. Adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Leaf wax was extracted and quantified. The spread of 1 μl droplets of distilled water, primisulfuron solution (without surfactant), primisulfuron solution with a nonionic surfactant and with an organosilicone surfactant was determined on the adaxial leaf surfaces {{of each of the}} weed species. The activity of primisulfuron without or with surfactants was assessed 3 weeks after treatment in terms of percent injury and plant fresh weight. Greenhouse studies were also conducted to investigate the bioherbicidal activity of Alternaria helianthi (Hansf.) Tubaki 2 ̆ 6 Nishih. on multiple-seeded cocklebur as affected by various surfactants. ^ The number of stomata per unit area on abaxial surface was more than on adaxial leaf surface of barnyardgrass, common lambsquarters and velvetleaf, whereas, common purslane and green foxtail had more stomata on adaxial surface than abaxial. Common lambsquarters had the highest wax content per unit of leaf area (274. 5 μg cm- 2) and velvetleaf had the lowest (7. 4 μg cm- 2). Wax content of common purslane was 153. 4 μg cm- 2. The mean values of the wax content per unit of leaf area in barnyardgrass and green foxtail were 35. 91 μg cm- 2 and 19. 14 μg cm- 2, respectively. Surfactants increased primisulfuron activity on common lambsquarters, common purslane, velvetleaf, and green foxtail. In general, organosilicone surfactant reduced the contact angle with increased spread area of the primisulfuron droplets more than the nonionic surfactant treatments and resulted in enhanced activity of primisulfuron. Alternaria helianthi resulted in significant reduction of fresh weight of multiple-seeded cockleburs when followed by a 12 h dew period as compared to a 6 h dew. Under short dew period (6 h), greater control of multiple-seeded cocklebur was achieved using higher rates of Activator 90 and Silwet L- 77 and may have great potentials for achieving effective biological control. ...|$|R
