40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea is {{associated}} with memory impairments, and higher rates of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder compared with community estimates. Autobiographical memory overgenerality, a behaviour characterized by difficulty recalling specific memories from one&# 039;s own life, is recognized as a marker of depression. Previous studies have demonstrated the predictive quality of specific autobiographical memory recall on the course of depression in patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea. However, it remains unclear whether impaired autobiographical memory is simply a feature of depression, {{or whether it is}} also impaired in patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea without depression. This study aimed to investigate whether autobiographical memory impairments can be observed in patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea, independent of the severity of depressive symptoms. Twenty-one patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea symptomatic for depressive symptoms (mean age = 43. 43 years, SD = 9. 97), 17 patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea asymptomatic for depressive symptoms (mean age = 40. 65 years, SD = 9. 39), and 20 healthy controls without sleep-disordered breathing (mean age = 32. 80 years, SD = 6. 69) completed an Autobiographical Memory Test. Patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea symptomatic for depressive symptoms recalled significantly fewer specific memories when compared with healthy controls (P = 0. 010). No difference in the recall of specific autobiographical memory was observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea. <b>With</b> regard to valence, symptomatic patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea recalled significantly fewer negative specific memories when compared with controls (P = 0. 010). Impairment in specific autobiographical memory recall can be observed in patients <b>with</b> obstructive <b>sleep</b> apnoea, regardless of the severity of depressive symptoms; however, this effect may not be as prominent in younger patients w...|$|R
