25|$|Space opera is {{adventure}} {{science fiction}} set mainly or entirely {{in outer space}} or on sometimes distant planets. The conflict is heroic, and typically on a large scale. It is also used nostalgically, and modern space opera may {{be an attempt to}} recapture the sense of <b>wonder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> golden age of science fiction. A pioneer of this subgenre is generally recognized to be Edward E. (Doc) Smith, with his Skylark and Lensman series. Isaac Asimov built his Foundation series along these lines. George Lucas's Star Wars series is among the most popular and famous franchises in cinematic space opera. Alastair Reynolds's Revelation Space series, Peter F. Hamilton's Void, Night's Dawn, Pandora's Star series, Stephen Hunt's Sliding Void series, Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep, A Deepness in the Sky are newer examples.|$|E
