5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, but that it was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca <b>with</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E

25|$|The term gained wide {{publicity}} {{when the}} former President of Indonesia B. J.

500|$|Alavés manager José Manuel Esnal praised {{his players}} despite their loss: [...] "Dortmund {{has seen a}} great final, and it was {{possibly}} the smallest team in the competition that made it great." [...] Esnal saluted his players for their character especially for equalising twice in the match: [...] "We played <b>with</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> class to get the score back to 4–4 {{at the end of}} normal time, the result of that, however, was that we were half dead going into extra-time. But we're the same team as we were two hours ago. One side always has to lose a final, just as one wins." ...|$|E
500|$|While Jennifer Ehle {{refused to}} {{capitalise}} {{on the success}} of the serial and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, the role of Mr. Darcy unexpectedly elevated Colin Firth to stardom. [...] Although Firth did not mind being recognised as [...] "a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal" [...] in a role that [...] "officially turned him into a heart-throb", he expressed the wish to not be associated <b>with</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice forever and was reluctant to accept similar roles. He took on diverse roles and co-starred in productions such as The English Patient (1996), Shakespeare in Love (1998), Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003), Love Actually (2003) and [...] (2004).|$|E

500|$|Biko's {{approach}} to activism focused on psychological empowerment, and {{both he and}} the BCM saw their main purpose as combating the feeling of inferiority that most black South Africans experienced. Biko expressed dismay at how [...] "the black man has become a shell, a shadow of man... bearing the yoke of oppression with sheepish timidity", and stated that [...] "the most potent weapon {{in the hands of}} the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed". He believed that blacks needed to affirm their own humanity by overcoming their fears and believing themselves worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities. He defined Black Consciousness as [...] "an inward-looking process" [...] that would [...] "infuse people <b>with</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> dignity". To promote this, the BCM adopted the slogan [...] "Black is Beautiful".|$|E
500|$|There were {{concerns}} {{in some quarters}} that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer. James McAvoy, who plays Thomas Langlois Lefroy, believed that filming in Ireland made her casting [...] "a bit safer" [...] than if they had shot in England. McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold, having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production White Teeth. McAvoy first assumed that Becoming Jane would be directly associated <b>with</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice, with his character possessing similarities with Mr. Darcy; the actor soon realised however [...] "that the screenplay was nothing like Pride and Prejudice. The screenwriter probably speculated {{on some of the}} inspiration for Pride and Prejudice but it is a completely different story." ...|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, in the Northern Isles the Scandinavian {{connection}} is still celebrated, {{one of the}} best-known such events [...] being the Lerwick fire-festival Up Helly Aa. In particular, Shetland's connection with Norway has proven to be enduring. When Norway became independent again in 1905 the Shetland authorities sent a letter to King Haakon VII in which they stated: [...] "Today no 'foreign' flag is more familiar or more welcome in our voes and havens than that of Norway, and Shetlanders continue to look upon Norway as their mother-land, and recall <b>with</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> affection the time when their forefathers were under the rule of the Kings of Norway." [...] At the 2013 Viking Congress held in Shetland the Scottish Government announced plans to strengthen Scotland’s historic links with Scandinavia.|$|E

500|$|Various {{commentators}} have offered opinions concerning the {{presence in the}} film of characters and themes from Austen's works, particularly <b>with</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice. Deborah Cartmell contended that Hathaway's Austen is a [...] "replica of Elizabeth Bennet (with a touch of impetuous Lydia thrown in)," [...] and added that the associations between Austen and Elizabeth are [...] "more explicit than in" [...] any other Austen biopic. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph declared that the film took [...] "good old Ps storyline and replace Elizabeth Bennet with Austen herself [...] a real-life pseudo-Darcy from the skimpiest of biographical evidence." [...] A Companion to Jane Austen observed that the [...] "physicality" [...] of Jane and Lefroy's kiss {{was similar to the}} [...] "passionate kiss" [...] between Elizabeth and Darcy in the 1995 serial Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed <b>with</b> <b>pride,</b> <b>and</b> although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just {{no question in my mind}} that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, Ferdinand and Marie {{undertook}} a diplomatic tour of France, Switzerland, Belgium and the United Kingdom. In England, she was warmly welcomed by George V, who declared that [...] "apart {{from the common}} aims, which we pursue, there are other and dear ties between us. Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born." [...] Similarly, Marie wrote that {{the day of her}} arrival in England was [...] "a great day for me, one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell <b>with</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction, to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something gave you a lump into your throat!"

Whilst visiting Geneva, Marie and Ferdinand became the first royals to enter the newly established headquarters of the League of Nations.|$|E
