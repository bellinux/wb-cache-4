6000|$|... 'O, {{how is it}} {{that man}} has so fascinated me?' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think. Her own self, as she had sat spell-bound before him, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see. Her gait was constrained, from the {{knowledge}} that his eyes were upon her until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall, and by ascending the rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the overhanging trees.|$|E
60|$|Violet, {{still very}} weak, {{could have been}} hysterical, but luckily was able to command herself, though, 'thank you!' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say.|$|E
60|$|That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{get out of}} him, {{unless he}} was {{stricken}} with remorse, when he even went the length of saying the word.|$|E
60|$|David did {{his best}} to show his {{gratitude}} to his dear aunt by studying hard, and trying to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> wish.|$|R
60|$|A few shillings now and then, <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> earn. The boy worked {{steadily}} on; dying by minutes, {{but never}} once giving utterance to complaint or murmur.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Welcome {{is not to}} be bought,' said James. 'I {{could not}} stand hearing him reply to poor granny's heartfelt rapture with his riches and his Cheveleigh, as if that <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> prize.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to hold in; and {{her eyes}} snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says: ...|$|E
6000|$|Incapable of {{answering}} him; forgetful {{of the ordinary}} restraints of social intercourse--with the one doubt that preserved her belief in Mirabel, eager for confirmation--Emily signed to this stranger to follow her into {{a corner of the}} room, out of hearing. She made no excuses: she took no notice of his look of surprise. One hope <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel, one word <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say, after that second assertion of Mirabel's guilt. Indicating Mrs. Rook by a glance at the bed, she whispered the word: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you born fool!" [...] She {{took up the}} {{spinning}} stick, {{and it looked like}} it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from giving him a crack with it. [...] "What made you think I'd like it?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> teach dancing--but <b>she</b> couldn't dance {{particularly}} well. And that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do.|$|R
50|$|She {{moved to}} Liverpool {{for six months}} to live with Charles, but six months <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take. <b>She</b> dropped him and {{returned}} to London.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me go! Let me go!" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> answer him, {{expressing the}} only thought of which in that dread moment {{her mind was}} capable.|$|R
6000|$|She {{followed}} him. With a faint cry of entreaty {{she made}} him turn to her, and held him in a trembling embrace, and rested {{her head on his}} bosom. [...] "Forgive me--be patient with me--love me." [...] That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say.|$|E
6000|$|And this <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{say after}} a {{separation}} of four years! Clarence was desperate, but as yet idealess and voiceless. At last, with an effort over his spoon, he gasped a floating recollection: [...] "Do you still like flapjacks, Susy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... and, if Minerva had not appeared, {{and held}} his hand, he had {{executed}} his design; and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to dissuade him from it. The event was, that he left the army, and would fight no more. Agamemnon gives his character thus to Nestor; ...|$|E
60|$|Then Moore was silent, {{holding her}} with his free hand, {{breathing}} hard, and slowly quieting down. Columbine felt then that he {{knew that there was}} something terribly wrong, and that perhaps he dared not voice his fear. At any rate, he silently held her, waiting. That silent wait grew unendurable for Columbine. She wanted to prolong this moment that <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever surrender. But she dared not do so, for she knew if he ever kissed her again her duty to Belllounds would vanish like mist in the sun.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, my dear,' said Anne; 'I {{will tell}} you what she said of you. She said you <b>were</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> wish in a sister, and that you were quite a {{reflective}} creature; and that is high praise from her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Mrs. Malory, so unusually genial in public, held {{frequent}} conventicles with Matilda in private. But Matilda {{declined to}} be jealous; they were only old friends, she said, these flagitious two; Dear Anne (that was the Vidame's Christian name) <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> wish.|$|R
60|$|Smoke {{looked at}} Labiskwee, who smiled, though it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{do to keep}} from sinking down. He nodded for her to push off, but she came near to him, and side by side, a dozen feet apart, they flew down through the {{stinging}} thickness of cold fire.|$|E
60|$|When {{the boys}} {{returned}} to the farmhouse Minnie ran out to meet them, and from their manner saw at once {{that they had no}} news worth mentioning. They could see that the girl had been crying, and now it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from bursting into tears again.|$|E
60|$|Hermione looked {{long and}} slow at Ursula, seeming to accept {{confirmation}} from her. Then {{the two women}} were silent. As {{soon as they were}} in accord, they began mutually to mistrust each other. In spite of herself, Ursula felt herself recoiling from Hermione. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to restrain her revulsion.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first moment}} of {{recollection}} brought to her mind the danger which had overpowered her senses; the next called to remembrance {{that of her}} father. She looked around; he {{was nowhere to be}} seen. [...] "My father, my father!" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ejaculate.|$|R
60|$|Weary and heartsick, Agnes {{lay down}} on the sofa, to rest and compose herself. The careful nurse brought in a {{reviving}} cup of tea. Her quaint gossip about herself and her occupations while Agnes had been away, acted as a relief to her mistress's overburdened mind. They were still talking quietly, when they were startled by a loud knock at the house door. Hurried footsteps ascended the stairs. The door of the sitting-room was thrown open violently; the courier's wife rushed in like a mad woman. 'He's dead! They've murdered him!' Those wild words <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say. <b>She</b> dropped on her knees {{at the foot of the}} sofa--held out her hand with something clasped in it--and fell back in a swoon.|$|R
60|$|Starting up, {{she begged}} {{to go and}} prepare her sister, but he peremptorily {{detained}} her, and, 'Oh, be kind to her,' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say, before in tripped Bertha, looking restless and amazed, but her retrousse nose, round features, and wavy hair so childish that the accusation seemed absurd.|$|R
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do {{to hinder}} her walk from losing its calm slowness, {{and before she}} could divest her {{intended}} reply of undignified sharpness, he continued: 'Who could have betrayed my presence? But for this, I meant that you {{should never have been}} aware that I was hovering near to watch over you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Phoebe was alarmed. She {{had little}} hope that their likings would coincide; his manner {{indicated}} defiance of opinion, {{and she could}} not but be averse to a person for whose sake he wished to turn them out. 'Well,' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say, and he proceeded: 'I suppose you never heard of Cecily Raymond.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It cut {{her to the}} heart. 'Gilbert!' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> exclaim, but {{the tone}} of pain made him look at her, as if in spite of himself, and as he saw the tears he exclaimed in an {{impatient}} voice of rude consolation, 'There's nothing to take so much to heart. No one thinks anything of it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In baskets. I'll {{get you a}} piece, and you can try it." [...] So Twinkle flew up {{and crept}} into her basket again, quickly {{returning}} {{with a bit of}} cookie in her claw. It was {{not much more than a}} crumb, but nevertheless it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> carry.|$|R
60|$|Nell {{was rather}} disheartened, {{when they stopped}} at a kind of wharf late in the afternoon, to learn {{from one of the}} men that they would not reach their place of {{destination}} until next day, and that, if she had no provision with her, she had better buy it there. She had but a few pence, having already bargained with them for some bread, but even of these it was necessary to be very careful, as {{they were on their way}} to an utterly strange place, with no resource whatever. A small loaf and a morsel of cheese, therefore, <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> afford, and with these she took her place in the boat again, and, after half an hour's delay during which the men were drinking at the public-house, proceeded on the journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur, monsieur," [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say; but her longing was {{to fling}} her arms about {{the neck of}} this man, as she might have flung them about the neck of a brother or a father, and sob out upon his {{shoulder}} the sudden relief and revulsion that his presence brought.|$|R
6000|$|Then Meta, in her turn, read D.V.X., which, as Ethel said, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> wish--of {{course it}} was dux et imperator, and Harry muttered into Norman's ear, [...] "ducks and geese!" [...] and then heaved a sigh, as {{he thought of the}} dux no longer. [...] "V.V.," [...] {{continued}} Meta; [...] "what can that mean?" ...|$|E
60|$|That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> obtain, and she {{secretly}} hoped {{there would}} be no winnings to perplex her. Thankful that she had not made him angry by the resistance for which she had prepared herself with secret prayer ever since the Mentone scheme had been proposed, she placed herself at Nuttie's disposition {{for the rest of the}} day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know: I do {{not mind}} it much," [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{bring herself to}} say, though she could not venture to be more decidedly ungracious before her father. [...] "Not much in itself," [...] she added, in a lower tone, as the {{conversation}} grew louder, [...] "it is the people, Philip Carey, and all,--but hush! listen." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} corner {{a quarter of}} a ton of well-clothed man with a rice-powdered, fat, white jowl, stood holding the chain of a devil-born bulldog whose forelegs were strangers by the length of a dachshund. A little woman in a last-season's hat confronted him and wept, which <b>was</b> plainly <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do, while he cursed her in low sweet, practised tones.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had tried}} to appease this hunger in many ways, but found little help. Her father's old books <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> command, and these she wore out with much reading. Inheriting his refined tastes, she found nothing to attract her in {{the society of the}} commonplace and often coarse people about her. She tried to like the buxom girls whose one {{ambition}} was to [...] "get married," [...] and whose only subjects of conversation were [...] "smart bonnets" [...] and [...] "nice dresses." [...] She tried to believe that the admiration and regard of the bluff young farmers was worth striving for; but when one well-to-do neighbor laid his acres at her feet, she found it impossible to accept for her life's companion a man whose soul was wrapped up in prize cattle and big turnips.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Falconer paused suddenly. She {{was a very}} truthful {{woman and}} she {{instantly}} realized that that last sentence was not true. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> not doing <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> for Camilla--she would not be glad, she feared, to do <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
