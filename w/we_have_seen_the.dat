500|$|Michael Tedder of Vulture {{awarded the}} episode—along with [...] "Junior Salesman"—four stars out of five. He enjoyed Kevin's telling off the Senator for his poor {{treatment}} {{of his friends}} and family, and said [...] "that it came with Kevin's halting delivery just made it better." [...] However, he was critical of the Brian subplot, calling it [...] "the least interesting way this camera crew reveal could have gone". Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. Despite noting that the show itself was still good in comparison to much of television, Cornet wrote that the episode {{is an example of the}} [...] "danger of needlessly dragging things out, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> waste of ending things before they have had the opportunity to reach their full potential in the past." [...] Cornet praised Kevin's [...] "truth bomb", writing that it [...] "worked beautifully", but she called [...] "the 'man behind the curtain' reveal ... a bitter disappointment" [...] and a [...] "cop-out" [...] to engage the audience.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Andrew Billen {{compared}} the contemporary cultural {{relevance of the}} series to The Way We Live Now, as a follow-up to his comparison of the first series with Vanity Fair: [...] "In previous years <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> anguish caused by infidelity, impotence and infertility. This season the characters face the hazards thrown up by miscarriage, alcoholism and a late-flowering career. Sustaining relationships looks as hard as ever. Yet there is nothing each protagonist wants more than old-fashioned domestic bliss." [...] The review resonated with other critics; in The Scotsman, Linda Watson-Brown wrote an overall positive review of the series in general—dismissing the spate of [...] "anti-Cold Feet" [...] reviews—but criticised [...] "the ease with which problems are resolved and morality used to slap the viewer in the face". The final episode set in Australia polarised critics; in a column focusing on Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the big-budget episode [...] "which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot" [...] of being the point the series jumped the shark, and Times columnist Caitlin Moran complimented it, but was concerned that the series' original main characters—Adam and Rachel—were being sidelined by everyone including Mike Bullen.|$|E

2500|$|My claim, so {{offensive}} to some, {{that the first}} task {{of the church is}} to make the world the world, not to make the world more just, is a correlative of this theological metaphysics.

2500|$|Shrewsbury's {{technique}} was criticised by Rait Kerr {{in his book}} 'The laws of cricket'. He wrote: [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> improvement in pitches enabled Arthur Shrewsbury {{to develop a new}} gospel of defensive batsmanship which soon made many converts. From about 1885 this technique involved an increasing use of the pads." [...] At the time the lbw law stated that for the batsman to be out, the ball had to pitch between wicket and wicket. In 1888 the MCC considered a change to the law but instead issued a statement saying that defending the wicket with the body was against the spirit of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{significance}} of the discriminant {{lies in the fact that}} ramified ultrametric places are all places obtained from factorizations in Qp where p divides the discriminant. [...] This is even true of the polynomial discriminant; however the converse is also true, that if a prime p divides the discriminant, then there is a p-place which ramifies. For this converse the field discriminant is needed. [...] This is the Dedekind discriminant theorem. [...] In the example above, the discriminant of the number field Q(x) with x3nbsp&−nbsp&xnbsp&−nbsp&1 = 0 is −23, and as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> 23-adic place ramifies. [...] The Dedekind discriminant tells us it is the only ultrametric place which does. [...] The other ramified place comes from the absolute value on the complex embedding of F.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 November 1936 {{came the}} final {{catastrophe}} – fire. Within hours the Palace was destroyed: the glow was visible across eight counties. That night, Buckland was walking his dog near the palace, {{with his daughter}} (Crystal Buckland, named after the palace) when they noticed a red glow within. Inside, he found two of his employees fighting a small office fire, that had started after {{an explosion in the}} women's cloakroom. Realising that it was a serious fire, they called the Penge fire brigade. But, even though 89 fire engines and over 400 firemen arrived they were unable to extinguish it. (The fire spread quickly in the high winds that night, because it could consume the dry old timber flooring, and the huge quantity of flammable materials in the building.) Buckland said, [...] "In a few hours <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> end of the Crystal Palace.

[...] MCA responsiveness to inquiries from the U.S. Central Authority has also improved. [...] The Office of Children’s Issues is now in regular (weekly and at times daily) contact with the MCA.

Every {{one of us has}} been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt {{that we are in the}} midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.|$|E
