Modern biophysical concepts of water transport and new measurement strategies are evaluated. A family of <b>water-transporting</b> proteins (water channels, aquaporins) has been identified, consisting of small hydrophobic proteins expressed widely in epithelial and nonepithelial tissues. The functional properties, genetics, and cellular distributions of these proteins are summarized. The majority of molecular-level information about <b>water-transporting</b> mechanisms comes from studies on CHIP 28, a 28 -kDa glycoprotein that forms tetramers in membranes; each monomer contains six putative helical domains surrounding a central aqueous pathway and functions independently as a water-selective channel. Only mutations in the vasopressin-sensitive water channel {{have been shown}} to cause human disease (non-X-linked congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus); the physiological significance of other water channels remains unproven. One mercurial-insensitive water channel has been identified, which has the unique feature of multiple overlapping transcriptional units. Systems for expression of water channel proteins are described, including Xenopus oocytes, mammalian and insect cells, and bacteria. Further work should be directed at elucidation of the role of water channels in normal physiology and disease, molecular analysis of regulatory mechanisms, and water channel structure determination at atomic resolution...|$|R

40|$|Water {{plays an}} {{important}} role for slope stability and typically consists of local precipitation (LP) and original slope groundwater (OSGW); high amount of the OSGW leads the slope groundwater (SGW) easily to exceed the critical level that causes slope failure in a heavy raining event. This study was to verify the source and significance of the OSGW for a creep slope adjoining a hydropower plant, northern Taiwan by an environmental stable isotope approach. Isotope results indicate that the source of the OSGW derived from leaking of the <b>water-transporting</b> system of the power plant; the leaking fraction in the SGW is as high as 70 - 80 %. High leaking component in the SGW indicates that the leaking water rather than local precipitation is the crucial factor for the mass movement of the creep slope.

Despite a considerable number of reports employing ovine MSCs (oMSCs) in tissue engineering, their molecular characterization is limited to few studies. Unlike human MSCs, ovine MSC are not well studied regarding isolation, expansion and surface antigen expression of oMSC.

Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane transporters that regulate the flow of water, glycerol and other small molecules across cellular membranes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Our aim was to identify aquaporins that function as water channels, mediating transcellular water transport in MTs of adult female Ae. aegypti.
