5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former, {{the premise of the}} novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas. The reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) {{were made of}} wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E

5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} the school <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1800s there was little abuse and {{strapping}} later became a routine. In 1960’s there were nightmarish abuses and students were taught that their language and beliefs were sins and not acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Liberal evangelicals in the United States were {{influenced}} by liberal evangelicals in the Church of England.

25|$|The modern {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that the prime reason {{for the death of}} Brittonic in most of England <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth to sixth centuries, a new political elite of Old English-speaking immigrants made it politically expedient for other people in Britain to adopt their new rulers' language and Anglo-Saxon ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|Dunne had {{obtained}} a War Office order for two D.8s, though one was cancelled because of late delivery. The other {{was delivered to}} Farnborough on 3 March 1914, where it was given the RFC number 366. It made several flights on 11 March piloted by N. S. Percival, who had flown the first D.8 many times at Eastchurch and was now an RFC officer. The general judgement <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> search for balance between stability and controllability, the Dunne design overemphasised the former.|$|E

25|$|Fighting was {{not limited}} to clan against clan. Because of his youth, Allan was {{vulnerable}} to being usurped by a Cameron cadet branch (distant family). Ewen Cameron of Erracht, uncle of the 14th chief of Clan Cameron, became suspect and so it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1580s, Donald's men, Cameron of Lochiel, murdered Ewan Cameron of Erracht in battle at Inverlochy Castle on behalf of young Allen, and retaining the line of hereditary succession for Camerons of Lochiel.|$|E
25|$|The {{study found}} that when mental {{rotation}} {{is used as a}} predictor of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between mental rotation and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern. Male correlations ranged from -0.03 to 0.54. However, an interesting finding <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. Interestingly enough, for the verbal aptitude test on SAT, {{there was a significant difference}} in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.|$|E
25|$|During {{this brief}} but vibrant period, Japanese {{communities}} (Nihonmachi) existed {{in many of}} the major ports and political centers of the region, including Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, Hội An in Nguyễn southern Viet Nam, Manila in the Spanish-controlled Philippines, and Phnom Penh in Cambodia. The largest, and perhaps most famous, Nihonmachi of the period <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Siamese port city and royal capital of Ayutthaya, whose head, Yamada Nagamasa, bore prominent posts and titles in the royal court. Yamada led an army of 700 Japanese, and took part in suppressing rebellions, civil wars, and succession disputes; he was also allowed to control monopolies over particular goods, such as deerskin, and was given at least nominal governorship of a few provinces at various points.|$|E

25|$|The {{cadre of}} the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw {{was formed by}} the legionnaires of the Polish Legions. In addition, it was filled by older {{soldiers}} from the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{who responded to the}} call to arms of Józef Poniatowski, and patriotic youth. In 1808, after the first emergency period was over, and the Duchy felt more secure, those who wished to leave the army were given leave. The army was expanded with large waves of new recruits on the eve of new wars in 1809 and 1812, when the Duchy fought other partitioners, which resulted in an influx of recruits from those territories, hoping to see their home liberated. The final recruitment phase <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall and winter of 1813, when the Duchy was trying to rally to its own defense in the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat in Russia.|$|E
25|$|After the Bomber Gap {{came the}} Missile Gap. Eisenhower {{wanted to use}} the U-2 to {{disprove}} the Missile Gap, but he had banned U-2 overflights of the USSR after meeting Secretary Khrushchev at Camp David. Another reason the President objected {{to the use of the}} U-2 <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear age, the intelligence he needed most was on their intentions, without which, the US would face a paralysis of intelligence. He was particularly worried that U-2 flights could be seen as preparations for first strike attacks. He had high hopes for an upcoming meeting with Khrushchev in Paris. Eisenhower finally gave into CIA pressure to authorize a 16-day window for flights, which was extended an additional six days because of poor weather. On May 1, 1960, the USSR shot down a U-2 flying over the Soviet territory. To Eisenhower, the ensuing coverup destroyed his perceived honesty, and his hope of leaving a legacy of thawing relations with Khrushchev. It would also mark the beginning of a long downward slide in the credibility of the Office of the President of the United States. Eisenhower later said that the U-2 coverup was the greatest regret of his Presidency.|$|E
