40|$|This {{research}} {{introduces a}} row compression and nested product decomposition of an n × n hierarchical {{representation of a}} rank structured matrix A, which extends the compression and nested product decomposition of a quasiseparable matrix. The hierarchical parameter extraction algorithm of a quasiseparable matrix is efficient, requiring only O(nlog(n)) operations, and is proven backward stable. The row compression is comprised of a sequence of small Householder transformations that are formed from the low-rank, lower triangular, off-diagonal blocks of the hierarchical representation. The row compression forms a factorization of matrix A, <b>where</b> A = <b>QC,</b> <b>Q</b> {{is the product of}} the Householder transformations, and C preserves the low-rank structure in both the lower and upper triangular parts of matrix A. The nested product decomposition is accomplished by applying a sequence of orthogonal transformations to the low-rank, upper triangular, off-diagonal blocks of the compressed matrix C. Both the compression and decomposition algorithms are stable, and require O(nlog(n)) operations. At this point, the matrix-vector product and solver algorithms are the only ones fully proven to be backward stable for quasiseparabl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we answer the {{question}} posed by M. Atiyah, see [12], and give an explicit formula for Floer homology of Brieskorn homology spheres {{in terms of their}} branching sets over the 3 –sphere. We further show how Floer homology is related to other invariants of knots and 3 –manifolds, among which are the ¯µ–invariant of W. Neumann and L. Siebenmann and the Jones polynomial. Essential progress is made in proving the homology cobordism invariance of our own ν–invariant, see [15]. Let p, <b>q,</b> and <b>r</b> be pairwise coprime positive integers. The Brieskorn homology 3 –sphere Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r)</b> is the link of the singularity of f − 1 (0), where f: C 3 → C is a map of the form f(x, y, z) = x p + y <b>q</b> + z <b>r.</b> The complex conjugation in C 3 acts on Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r)</b> turning it into a double branched cover of S 3 branched over a Montesinos knot k(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r).</b> In this paper, we express the Floer instanton homology groups In(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r)),</b> see [5], in terms of the Casson’s λ–invariant of Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r)</b> and the signature of the knot k(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r).</b> Theorem 1. The Floer homology group In(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r))</b> is trivial if n is odd, and is a free abelian group of the rank if n is even. rankIn(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r))</b> = 1 16 (8 λ(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r))</b> − (− 1) n/ 2 sign k(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r))</b> The groups I∗(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r))</b> were studied by R. Fintushel and R. Stern in [6] (we use the Floer index convention of this paper). They gave an algorithm which for any given set of positive coprime integers p, <b>q,</b> <b>r</b> computes the ranks of I∗(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r)).</b> However, their approach does not give a closed form formula for I∗(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r)).</b> It should be mentioned though that the vanishing of the groups In(Σ(p, <b>q,</b> <b>r))</b> for odd n follows from [6]; we give an alternative proof in Section 3...|$|R

If p, <b>q</b> and <b>r</b> are in proportion then q is called a mean proportional to (or the geometric mean of) p and r.
