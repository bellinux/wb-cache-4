40|$|Biomass {{has a large}} energy potential. A {{comparison}} between the available potential with the current use shows that, on a worldwide level, about two-fifths of the existing biomass energy potential is used. In most {{areas of the world}} the current biomass use is clearly below the available potential. Only for Asia does the current use exceed the available potential, i. e. non-sustainable biomass use. Therefore, increased biomass use, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> for upgrading is possible in most countries. A possible alternative is to cover the future demand for renewable energy, by increased utilization of forest residues and residues from the <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> industry, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> for production of densified biofuels (Parrika, 2004). If carried out on a large scale, the increased use of agricultural resources for energy will have the effect of raising the prices of most commodity crops and reducing the need for subsidies – with particular benefit for producers of commodity crops in developing countries. An aggressive program of bioenergy development could lead to reductions in government support to farmers without any loss of income. The long-term success of bio-based facilities and markets is dependent in part on the level of commitment of feedstock from forest landowners and farmers.  Forest, crop, and animal residues present considerable potential as a biomass feedstock.  They are renewable, sustainable, locally available, and often considered carbon-neutral when compared to fossil fuels (Hoogwijk, 2004; Mathews, 2008). </p...|$|R
40|$|Biobased {{materials}} {{made from}} renewable resources, such as wood, {{play an important}} role in the sustainable development of society. One main challenge of biobased building materials is their inherent moisture sensitivity, a major cause for fungal decay, mold growth and dimensional instability, resulting in decreased service life as well as costly maintenance. A new building material known as wood-plastic composites (WPCs) has emerged. WPCs are a combination of a thermoplastic matrix and a wood component, the former is usually recycled polyethylene or polypropylene, and the latter a <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> residual, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sawdust and wood shavings. The objective of this thesis was to gain more insight about characteristics of WPCs containing a modified wood component. The hypothesis was that a modified wood component in WPCs would increase the moisture resistance and durability in outdoor applications. The study comprises both injection molded and extruded WPC samples made with an unmodified, acetylated, thermally modified or furfurylated wood component in a polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cellulose ester (CAP, a cellulose ester containing both acetate and propionate substituents) or polylactate (PLA) matrix. The WPCs were prepared with 50 - 70 weight-% wood. The emphasis was on studying the moisture sorption, fungal resistance and micromorphological features of these new types of composites. Water sorption in both liquid and vapor phases was studied, and the biological performance was studied both in laboratory and in long term outdoor field tests. Micromorphological features were assessed by analyzing of the wood component prior to and after processing, and by studying the composite microstructure by means of a new sample preparation technique based on UV excimer laser ablation combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the WPCs with a modified wood component had a distinctly lower hygroscopicity than the WPCs with unmodified wood, which resulted in less wood-plastic interfacial cracks when subjected to a moisture soaking-drying cycle. Durability assessments in field and marine tests showed that WPCs with PP or CAP as a matrix and 70 weight-% unmodified wood degraded severely within a few years, whereas the corresponding WPCs with a modified wood component were sound after 7 years in field tests and 6 years in marine tests. Accelerated durability tests of WPCs with PLA as a matrix showed only low mass losses due to decay. However, strength losses due to moisture sorption suggest that the compatibility between the PLA and the different wood components must be improved. The micromorphological studies showed that WPC processing distinctly reduces the size and changes the shape of the wood component. The change was most pronounced in the thermally modified wood component which became significantly reduced in size. The disintegration of the modified <b>wood</b> components during <b>processing</b> also creates a more homogeneous micromorphology of the WPCs, which may be beneficial from a mechanical performance perspective. Future studies are suggested to include analyses of the surface composition, the surface energy and the surface energy heterogeneity of both wood and polymer components in order to tailor new compatible wood-polymer combinations in WPCs and biocomposites.

This helps relate replication techniques to each other. We define a novel replication technique with parsimonious processing, called semi-passive replication, for which we also give an algorithm. The most significant aspect of semi-passive replication is that it requires a weaker system model than existing techniques of the same family. We define a variant of the Consensus problem, called Lazy Consensus, upon which our semi-passive replication algorithm is based. The main difference between Consensus and Lazy Consensus is a property of laziness which requires that initial values are computed only when they are actually needed...|$|R

Here, we describe the process of ribosome biogenesis as a target of a large variety of chemotherapeutic drugs. We determined the inhibitory concentration of 36 chemotherapeutic drugs for transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA by in vivo labeling experiments. Inhibitory drug concentrations were correlated {{to the loss of}} nucleolar integrity. The synergism of drugs inhibiting ribosomal RNA synthesis at different levels was studied. Drugs inhibited ribosomal RNA synthesis either at the level of (i) rRNA transcription (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, methotrexate), (ii) early rRNA <b>processing</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> camptothecin, flavopiridol, roscovitine), or (iii) late rRNA <b>processing</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> 5 -fluorouracil, MG- 132, homoharringtonine). Blockage of rRNA transcription or early rRNA processing steps caused nucleolar disintegration, whereas blockage of late rRNA processing steps left the nucleolus intact.

40|$|International audienceAccording to the default-mode {{interference}} hypothesis, suboptimal {{performance in}} tasks requiring selective attention occurs when off-task <b>processing</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> mind wandering) supported by default-mode regions interferes with on-task <b>processing</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> attention) enabled by task-positive regions. In the present functional MRI study, we therefore investigated whether suboptimal {{performance in a}} selective attention task was linked to heightened interactions between a key default-mode region (the posterior cingulate cortex; PCC) and a key task-positive region (the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; DLPFC). We also investigated whether heightened interactions between the PCC and the left DLPFC were linked to enhanced future performance, consistent with prior data suggesting that such interactions index adaptive changes to the cognitive system. In line with both of these predictions, increases of current-trial functional connectivity between the PCC and the left DLPFC were linked to increases of response time in the current trial (i. e., suboptimal performance), but to decreases of response time in the next trial (i. e., enhanced performance). This double dissociation provides novel support for the default-mode interference hypothesis. Moreover, it suggests the possibility that, {{in at least some}} cases, default-mode interference indexes processes that optimize future performance...|$|R

For example, the autism-psychosis model predicts psychosis spectrum conditions can be characterized as a cognitive pattern of very poor Systemizing alongside superior Empathizing ability (autism demonstrating the diametrically opposing cognitive profile). However, little experimental research has been carried out to date testing the cognitive profile associated with psychosis. Methods: The present study used a large non-clinical sample to investigate the relationship between a “jumping to conclusions” (JTC) reasoning bias commonly seen in patients with delusions and measures of Empathizing and Systemizing. Results: Those showing a JTC bias demonstrated greater Empathizing and reduced Systemizing compared to a non-JTC group, irrespective of biological sex. Sex differences were identified in Empathizing and Systemizing but not the JTC. Conclusions: These results show a cognitive pattern consistent with predictions from the autism-psychosis model. In a non-clinical population, a reasoning bias associated with delusions is associated with an Emphasizing/Systemizing profile opposite to that characteristic of autism...|$|R
