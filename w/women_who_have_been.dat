5|$|Orunodoyer Ognishakhi (Pledge to a New Dawn), {{the first}} film about the war, was {{screened}} in 1972 on the first Bangladeshi Independence Day celebration. It draws on the experiences of an actor called Altaf. While trying to reach safe haven in Calcutta, he encounters <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> raped. The images of these birangona, stripped and vacant-eyed from the trauma, are used as testimony to the assault. Other victims Altaf meets are shown committing suicide or having lost their minds.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular men and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she inwardly develops a degree of doubt in herself. All three armies eventual convene {{at the base of the}} Tower of Guidance. Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E

25|$|The women {{involved}} {{in the practice of}} prostitution in Pakistan can be divided into three broad categories: <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> trafficked or lured into the profession, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born into the profession and women who willingly seek out a pimp to make extra money. Trafficked women are mainly found in the brothels, while those who willingly join this profession work as call girls, usually accompanied by a dalal or bharva or pimp. Those born into the profession are 'schooled' at home and operate under the management of their mother or another older female relative.|$|E

25|$|During pregnancy, a {{woman is}} at higher risk to be abused or long-standing abuse may change in severity, causing {{negative}} health effects to the mother and fetus.

Mercury exposures in excess of dietary selenium intakes in young children can have severe neurological consequences, preventing nerve sheaths from forming properly.

25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{extremely}} rare in orchidectomised transgender <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> treated with oestrogens for {{a prolonged period}} of time.

25|$|Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, {{practices}} and laws exist {{in many countries}} and institutions {{in every part of}} the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon.

25|$|Before the 20th century, {{adultery}} {{was often}} punished harshly.

Examples of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> executed for adultery in Medieval and Early Modern Europe include Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria (in 1256), Agnese Visconti (in 1391), Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda (in 1418), Anne Boleyn (in 1536), and Catherine Howard (in 1542). The enforcement of adultery laws varied by jurisdiction. In England, the last execution for adultery {{is believed to have}} taken place in 1654, when a woman named Susan Bounty was hanged.|$|E
25|$|Immigrant {{status in}} the United States is a {{predictor}} for breastfeeding adherence. In particular, the Hispanic paradox {{plays a role in}} the high breastfeeding rates observed among Hispanic/Latina women in the United States. Breastfeeding initiation rates among this population are higher for less acculturated immigrants; Hispanic <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the United States for longer are less likely to breastfeed. This disparity does not depend on age, income level, or education level; more acculturated Hispanics are likely to cite the same reasons for bottle-feeding as native-born white women do. In many cases, the connection that Hispanic women feel to their culture and its values can strongly influence their decision regarding breastfeeding.|$|E
