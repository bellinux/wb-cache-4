5|$|A {{condition}} {{imposed by}} Byrom <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{the right to}} present the living. The first rector, John Clowes, held the office for 62 years {{until his death in}} 1831. He was commemorated by two stone tablets in the church, one by either Richard Westmacott or his son, erected after his death and one, the only example of the work of John Flaxman in Manchester, to celebrate his 50th anniversary as rector. Clowes preached the first Sunday school sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret was {{that he and his}} wife had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|MGySgt Guadalupe Denogean is an {{immigrant}} from Mexico {{who has served}} in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Denogean was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq. During {{the time that he}} received treatment for his wounds, he was asked if he had any requests. His answer <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> two: First, he wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted to be an American citizen.|$|E
50|$|His most {{distinctive}} feature <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> never <b>been</b> injured.|$|R
50|$|He died on October 26, 1915 in Constantinople, rumors <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> poisoned.|$|R

5|$|Police {{also found}} that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club {{restaurant}} worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability to}} play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} member of Institut International de la Paix in 1913. He was a {{consultant}} for the Norwegian Nobel Institute from 1904 to 1913, with the task of examining proposed candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize. From 1918 to 1942 he served on the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In 1931, he gave the Award Ceremony Speech for the Nobelists Jane Addams and Nicholas Murray Butler, but was absent in the decisive meeting in 1936 that awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky. He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not lived in Norway since 1940, but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.|$|E

50|$|A {{setback for}} James <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to stop {{testosterone}} injections, {{because of a}} rare condition of his body not tolerating it.|$|R
5|$|Mary was courted by Duke Philip of Bavaria {{from late}} 1539, {{but he was}} Lutheran and his suit for her hand was unsuccessful. Over 1539, the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, {{negotiated}} a potential alliance with the Duchy of Cleves. Suggestions that Mary marry the Duke of Cleves, who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister Anne was agreed. When the king saw Anne {{for the first time}} in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage. Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> plotted to marry Mary himself. Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.|$|E
25|$|After the West Indies, Hill {{was never}} {{considered}} for Test selection again; the general view <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been tried and found wanting at Test level.|$|E

25|$|The second {{occurred}} between 6 and 11 March 1807. The accused was Sir Home Popham and the charge <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> conducted an unapproved (and notably quixotic and unsuccessful) expedition to Buenos Ayres, leaving his duty station, the Cape of Good Hope, undefended. The charge was found proven {{and the court}} reprimanded Sir Home.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on later}} {{analysis}} of the information from all sides, it appears clear that Westmoreland could not sustain a libel suit because CBS's principal allegation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> caused intelligence officers to suppress facts. Westmoreland's anger {{was caused by the}} implication of the broadcast that his intent was fraudulent and that he ordered others to lie.|$|E
25|$|Scelba's {{fall was}} {{accomplished}} by his own party, due to political manoeuvring of party rivals like ex-Premier Giuseppe Pella (who wanted to be Premier again) and Party Secretary Amintore Fanfani (who also liked to be Premier). His chief regret, said Scelba, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been overthrown not by a parliamentary vote but by party manoeuvring.|$|E

6000|$|What <b>was</b> this <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> said to her? He {{would not}} marry because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{his mother and}} sisters to support.

And could it <b>be</b> {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not known this--had not read her heart as she had read his? Could it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come there day after day, looking to her for love, and sympathy, and kindness--that sort of kindness which a man demands from no one but her he loves, and which no one can give him unless she loves him? Could it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done this and then thought that it all meant nothing? that the interchange of such feelings had no further signification? ...|$|R

25|$|Home Box Office (HBO) {{wanted to}} {{interview}} him for a feature length documentary on the college basketball scandal of 1951 called , but he refused.

25|$|On 28 November {{he faced}} a court martial on board Gladiator at Portsmouth. The charge <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> failed to follow orders {{to proceed to}} Quebec to bring home a convoy.

25|$|Berkeley died unmarried, a {{proposal}} {{he had made}} to Sir John Lawson's daughter in 1665 having been rejected.

25|$|Some {{elements}} were named for {{aspects of the}} history of their discovery. In particular, technetium and promethium were so named because the first samples detected were artificially synthesised; neither of the two has any isotope sufficiently stable to occur in nature on Earth in significant quantities. The connection to the Titan Prometheus <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been fabled to have stolen fire from the gods for mankind.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the split}} in the world chess {{championship}} in 1993, there were two rival world titles: the official FIDE world title, and the PCA world title held by Garry Kasparov. The rationale behind Kasparov's title <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been defeated in a match, but in fact had defeated the rightful challenger Nigel Short in 1993, so FIDE had no power to strip the title from him.|$|E
25|$|After Zach Ramsay's disappearance, Bar-Jonah {{also began}} to hold cookouts {{in which he was}} {{reported}} to serve burgers, spaghetti, chili, meat pies, casseroles, and the like to guests. At many of these cookouts, a number of persons told Bar-Jonah that the meat had a peculiar taste to it; Bar-Jonah's response <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone deer hunting and used the deer meat in the dishes.
