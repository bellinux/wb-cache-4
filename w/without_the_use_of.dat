50|$|Bruckner’s {{designation}} of this composition as a Choral-Messe referred to its simple, hymn-like style. Tonally the work follows conventional harmonic patterns, but, as Bruckner {{was to do}} throughout his life, it also contains frequent modulations, often to rather distant keys, <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> pivot chords. <b>The</b> frequent appearances of unison passages throughout this work are an additional hallmark of Bruckner’s later style.
