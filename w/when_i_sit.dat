[...] At Henderson's insistence, the {{giveaway}} plastic dolls had one atypical modification: [...] "I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [...] like I'm playing the game." [...] Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: [...] "Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> around {{and look at the}} game and things ain't going right, I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Indians {{acted like}} children; {{they tried to}} cheat each other and got cheated themselves. When it comes my turn to sell my land, I do not think I shall give it up as they did." [...] Regarding {{possible}} future land cessions, he said: [...] "Father I speak for my people, not for myself. I am an old man. My fire is almost outthere is but little smoke. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> in my wigwam & smoke my pipe, I think of what has past and what is to come, and it makes my heart shake. When business comes before us, we will try and act like Chiefs. If any thing is to be done, it had better be done straight." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E

2500|$|Heap {{states that}} her song lyrics come from {{personal}} experience, {{but are not}} straightforwardly confessional. She has stated [...] "Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> down to write a lyric, {{it is in the}} heat of the moment, and something has just happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that several}} {{different}} versions of the prayer can be found. For example, some render the beginning verse of each major section as [...] "I arise today" [...] rather than [...] "I bind to myself today." [...] The more problematic verses can also be found in different renderings, such as the verse [...] "Against spells of women, and smiths, and druids" [...] as [...] "Against spells of witches and smiths and wizards" [...] and [...] "Christ in the fort, Christ in the chariot seat, and Christ in the poop [...] " [...] as [...] "Christ when I lie down, Christ <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> down, Christ when I arise." ...|$|E

6000|$|Haney replied: [...] "Not for cripples. Time was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> could <b>sit</b> {{all night}} in the 'lookout's chair,' but not now. Ten o'clock finds me wishful towards the bed." [...] He said this with a faint smile. But the pathos of it, the truth of it, went to Bertha's heart, as it did to Mrs. Congdon's. Not merely was his body maimed, but his mind had {{correspondingly}} been weakened by that tearing charge of shot.|$|R

I write one paragraph and my narrator breaks the deal and begins to lie. There are no rules except that I can’t forsake my original intention. To find that hidden thing is driving me nuts.” ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{they were}} comfortably seated Blair went on: [...] "Do you know, Dare, I don't miss my leg so much when I'm crutching around.

6000|$|... "The truth is, Dolly," [...] {{said the}} elder sister, [...] "that we feel so unlike marrying and giving in {{marriage}} at Nuncombe, that I'm afraid you'll lose your brightness and become dowdy, and grim, and misanthropic, as we are. <b>When</b> mamma and <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> {{down to what}} we call dinner, I always {{feel that there is}} a grace hovering in the air different to that which she says." ...|$|R
5000|$|Much {{attention}} to detail still goes into rendering these stylized versions, Jeanty saying, [...] "It takes me 30% more time to do a Buffy page than, say, a Gambit page, because of the likenesses.

5000|$|Of her lyrics, she says, [...] "I write lyrics about junkyard prostitutes, {{life in the}} fearsome {{crowd and}} the fact that your lover is 72.8% water.

6000|$|Alas, no! {{my little}} friend was gone. There {{he lay on}} his back on the mantel-piece, his legs meekly folded, and his wings stiff and still.

My poor little Buzz had sung his last song, danced his last dance, and gone where the good flies go. I was very sorry and buried him among the ivy roots, where the moss lay green above him, the sun shone warmly on him, and the bitter cold could never come. I miss him very much; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> writing, I miss his cheerful voice and busy wings; at meals there is no tiny little body to drink up spilt drops and eat the crumbs: in the evenings, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> alone, I want him more than ever, and every day, as I water my plants, I say, softly,-- ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{a freedom}} fighter he {{took issue with}} BNP's {{alliance}} with Jamaat-e-Islami since their top leaders were accused of war crime. He left BNP because of disagreements with chairperson Khaleda Zia regarding Jamaat-e-Islami inclusion in the Four Party Alliance. In a statement he said,"It hurts my conscience <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have to <b>sit</b> with Razakaar and al-Badrs at the same table. It {{reminds me of the}} days in 1971 when boys fought under my command and laid down their lives." [...] He was one of the pioneers of war crimes trial movement.

5000|$|As a boy, Williams {{learned to}} ride horses {{from one of}} his owners. Williams states, [...] "He taught me to ride, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> could <b>sit</b> my horse well 'bare-back' he had a saddle made for me at the then famous 'McKinzie's' saddlery, sign of the 'White Horse' at the corner of Church and Chalmers Street." [...] This {{training}} to ride was not wholly unique to Williams' experience. In fact, enslaved people were essential to the world of horse racing in the American South. Jockeys and trainers were commonly enslaved people. Despite limited privileges, these enslaved horse riders were still subjected to the realities of being slaves in a slave society. Williams never became a formal jockey, however, and of this he says the following: [...] "Possibly Mr. Dane had 'views', concerning me for he owned several fast horses, but before I was old enough to be of practical service, 'Sherman came marching through Georgia.'" ...|$|R
