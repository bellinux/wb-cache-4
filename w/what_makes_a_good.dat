2500|$|The {{episode was}} met with {{generally}} positive reviews from critics. [...] Alasdair Wilkins of io9 gave the episode a positive review, calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] and writing, [...] "'The Mutants are Revolting' is another excellent addition, with Futurama's customary mix of jokes, emotions, and wild ideas." [...] Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine gave the episode a B, stating that it [...] "was good, but not on par with the best episodes of the season. It did, however, meet all the criteria of <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> Futurama episode. There was the goofy and fun premise involving the two primary characters of the show, Fry and Leela. More importantly, Futurama takes {{full advantage of the}} fact that it is animated and set far in the future. And, of course, there’s the usual witty banter and quirky one-liners that permeate every corner of the show. These elements combined to give us a nice farewell to a successful comeback season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a positive review, rating it an 8.5/10. [...] Canning described [...] "The Mutants Are Revolting" [...] as a solid and funny, quality episode, but felt that it did not have the landmark feel of a 100th episode. [...] Merrill Barr of Film School Rejects gave the episode a positive review, feeling that although the episode was not as funny as other episodes from the season, it [...] "was perfect in its own way. It was straight forward and never missed a beat." [...] Barr also praised the episode's subtle jokes and lack of [...] "forced topicalness".|$|E
2500|$|Like SN2 {{reaction}}s, {{there are}} quite a few factors that affect the reaction rate of SN1 reactions. [...] Instead of having two concentrations that affect the reaction rate, there is only one, substrate. [...] The rate equation for this would be Rate=k. [...] Since the rate of a reaction is only determined by its slowest step, the rate at which the leaving group [...] "leaves" [...] determines the speed of the reaction. [...] This means that the better the leaving group, the faster the reaction rate. [...] A general rule for <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leaving group is the weaker the conjugate base, the better the leaving group. [...] In this case, halogens are going to be the best leaving groups, while compounds such as amines, hydrogen, and alkanes are going to be quite poor leaving groups. [...] As SN2 reactions were affected by sterics, SN1 reactions are determined by bulky groups attached to the carbocation. [...] Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. [...] In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. [...] It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. [...] The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. [...] It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. [...] It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.|$|E

Palliative care offers an opportunity to challenge values at a deeply personal level as it brings experiences of pain and suffering alongside clinical knowledge and skills. Palliative care is holistic and so real scenarios where physical, psychological, social and spiritual issues are evident can be presented in an interactive, learner centered environment. Training in ethics alongside clinical skills will assist the development of judgment which should also be assessed. Communication skills enable the clinician to hear and understand the needs and wishes of those facing life limiting illness. Training should include aspects of modeling and mentorship to demonstrate and integrate the learning with the realities of clinical practice and include those who lead and influence policy and advocacy...|$|R
