This arbitrary guidance exists despite these habitats being among the most biodiverse in rural Europe. To date, most biodiversity research in agricultural landscapes has focused on plants, birds and invertebrates. Bats are also important bio-indicators of agricultural landscapes, but to my knowledge no study has explicitly focused on bat diversity in relation to this policy. In this thesis, I investigate how bat activity, foraging and species richness is affected in twenty-six <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> along a gradient of tree density, from open to dense pastures. In parallel, nearby open fields and deciduous woodlands were sampled, creating a triplet of habitats being surveyed simultaneously. Bat species were divided into feeding guilds to explore how functional diversity affects response to habitat and landscape configuration. The overall contribution of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> to the species pool of bats within a heterogeneous, low intensity agricultural landscape was also explored. I found a consistent increase in bat activity and species richness within <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> along the tree density gradient and across most feeding guilds. This in combination with shrub density was the strongest predictor of total bat activity and foraging; whilst structural diversity of pastures was most strongly correlated with species richness. <b>Wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> contributed more to total species richness than forested habitats. Interestingly, higher activity levels of forest feeding specialists were observed in pastures compared to forests. At the landscape level, amount of water and deciduous forest were the strongest predictors of bat activity. This study demonstrates that tree density within <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> is not a limiting factor of bat activity and that other habitat and landscape parameters are important. <b>Wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> may also be {{an important component of}} current landscapes with little remaining deciduous forest. In conclusion, focusing solely on tree density limits will not help to preserve the ecological requirements for bats within agricultural landscapes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSilvopastoral {{systems of}} the Swiss Jura Mountains serve as a {{traditional}} source of forage and timber in the subalpine vegetation belt, but their vulnerability to land use and climate change puts their future sustainability at stake. We coupled experimental and modeling approaches {{to assess the impact}} of climate change on the pasture-woodland landscape. We drew conclusions on the resistance potential of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> with different management intensities by sampling along a canopy cover gradient. This gradient spanned from unwooded pastures associated with intensive farming to densely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> associated with extensive farming. Transplanted mesocosms of these ecosystems placed at warmer and drier conditions provided experimental evidence that climate change reduced herbaceous biomass production in unwooded pastures but had no effect in sparsely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures,</b> and even stimulated productivity in densely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Through modeling these results with a spatially explicit model of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> (WoodPaM) modified for the current application, results were extrapolated to the local landscape under two regionalized Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for climate change. This led to the suggestion that within the Jura pasture-woodlands, forage production in the near future (2000 – 2050 AD) would be affected disproportionately throughout the landscape. A stable forage supply in hot, dry years would be provided only by extensive and moderate farming, which allows the development of an insulating tree cover within grazed pastures. We conclude that such structural landscape diversity would grant wood-pastures with a buffering potential in the face of climate change in the forthcoming decades...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} land-use policies and natural events {{on the evolution of}} two <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> in the Jura Mountains in Switzerland between 1934 and 2000. The socioeconomic context and the local conditions were seen as major driving forces influencing land management practices which in turn redefined land-use policies. We studied the dynamics of the Jura Mountains' <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures,</b> combining a thorough knowledge of the historic context with aerial image analysis. Besides pointing out general milestones in the evolution of Swiss land policy, we compiled chronicles on the management for both study sites on the basis of archives and interviews. Aerial images taken at time intervals of approximately 15 years were chosen to identify land-cover changes. The method used to analyze them relied on a structural classification of phytocoenoses, thus allowing the determination of four categories of tree-cover densities ranging from unwooded pastures to ungrazed forest. We reported overall aerial changes for each tree density class as well as spatial transitions from one category to another. The combination of spatial statistics with qualitative data depicting the evolution of the historic context gives {{a better understanding of the}} land-use changes and their rationale. The most important changes in tree density occurred during World War II and resulted in a more open landscape. The intensive use of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> during the war was the consequence of a high demand for wood and food resources. Postwar protectionist regulations, agricultural subsidies, and technical improvements maintained considerable pressure on <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Storms and drought episodes further exacerbated this process in some areas. The trend then reversed from the 1970 s onwards because of the limitations put on milk production and the falling price of wood. This resulted in a more extensive use of pastures, leading to tree encroachment. However, remote sites were more impacted than pastures closer to inhabited areas, which exhibited a trend towards more segregation between grassland and densely <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> With both extensification and segregation of land use, the complex vegetation mosaic and the landscape diversity that characterize <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> are threatened but still offer good economic opportunities that call for differentiated management strategies...|$|R

We examined if the spatial redistribution of nitrogen among habitats by cattle could restore nutrient-poor conditions in preferred foraging habitats, and conversely whether such translocation {{could lead to}} extreme eutrophication in preferred resting habitats. We used nitrogen content of different diet classes, habitat use, foraging and defecation behavior, weight gain, and nitrogen losses in the actual situation to explore four different habitat proportion scenarios and two different foraging strategies to calculate a net nitrogen balance per habitat. An atmospheric deposition of 30 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 with varying interception factors according to the habitat types was included in an integrated nitrogen balance. All scenarios showed a net nitrogen transport from grassland and <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> to forest habitat. We found that nitrogen redistribution strongly depends on habitat proportion. Nitrogen losses from preferred grassland habitat can be high, given its proportion is small. Depletion is only to be expected at excretion-free areas and probably is of minor importance to trigger the establishment of woody species. In general, nitrogen transported by cattle was much lower than input by atmospheric deposition, but grazing can compensate for high N inputs in excretion-free areas and maintain grassland types that support critical loads of 20 - 25 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. In none of the scenarios, N transport by cattle resulted in the exceeding of critical nitrogen loads to vulnerable forest ground vegetation...|$|E

Plots with tree stumps and higher cover of rocky outcrops and unpalatable plants {{were more likely to}} contain Picea saplings. Conclusions: Unpalatable plants, rocky outcrops and tree stumps seem to form safe sites for Picea saplings in this grazed system, improving their establishment and survival.

40|$|Summary 1. In {{endangered}} <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> ecosystems established tree saplings {{are frequently}} found in spatial association with protective structures, suggesting nurse effects. This associational resistance {{is thought to}} be a driving force behind tree regeneration in wooded pastures. Experimental evidence for associational resistance is, however, scarce. We studied the effects of unpalatable plants on tree sapling performance in a <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> ecosystem in Switzerland and tested the associational resistance hypothesis experimentally. 2. We transplanted 600 Picea abies saplings of two size classes (5 cm and 10 cm) in plots: (i) with unpalatable plants (either Gentiana lutea or Cirsium acaule, representing a chemically and mechanically defended species, respectively); (ii) with one of both unpalatable plants clipped to the ground; and (iii) without any unpalatable plants. Grazing intensity was measured once in each plot and tree sapling performance was followed for 2 consecutive years. 3. Grazing intensity was significantly higher in plots without unpalatable plants, and significantly higher in plots with Cirsium than with Gentiana. Correspondingly, sapling survival (21 ¿ 5 % and 10 ¿ 6 % after 1 and 2 grazing years, respectively) was significantly higher near unpalatable plants, and significantly higher in plots with Gentiana than with Cirsium. Large tree saplings survived significantly better than small ones, and depended less on the unpalatable plants for survival. 4. Except for saplings planted near Gentiana, sapling removal by cows and horses was the major cause of death, the extent varying between unpalatable species and treatments. 5. The growth in height of the saplings was unaffected by the treatments. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that unpalatable plants can enhance tree regeneration in wooded pastures. Sapling survival was significantly higher near unpalatable plants where grazing intensity was significantly lower. Protection against cattle is particularly important for small saplings. These results have important management implications for the endangered and disappearing wooded pastures in western Europe. Transplanting tree saplings near unpalatable plants could be an alternative reforestation technique in intensively grazed wooded pastures. On the other hand, removal of unpalatable plants and shrubs might prevent or slow down undesired tree encroachment in less intensively grazed areas.

In each cell of each plot and every month from May to September, we estimated dominance, and grazing occurrence of all species. Plant communities included an eutrophic grazed meadow, a temporary refused meadow, an underwood herb community and an oligotrophic lawn. Our results showed that seasonal changes in species composition were very strong and scale-dependent. Changes at plot scale were mainly driven by a seasonal shift. Changes at cell scale suggested high small-scale dynamics of species. Despite high changes at cell scale, {{the structure of the}} community did not change and local species richness did not show any trend. We found no correlation between the turnover at cell scale and cattle activity.

40|$|A {{system of}} <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> can be {{described}} by seven biological state variables (trees, shrubs, underwood grasslands, fallows, eutrophic meadows, oligrotrophic lawns and cattle) linked by a network of dynamic interactions, which are controlled by altitude and human activities. PATUMOD is a spatially implicit compartment model designed to simulate vegetation dynamics in such silvopastoral ecosystems at community level and according to an equilibrium paradigm. Computer simulations show that the state variables generally end up on a steady-state (one-point attractor), independent on their initial values but strongly dependent on cattle load. At a given altitude, to each value of the stock density is corresponding a stable equilibrium characterised by a given relative cover of each vegetation component. If the initial values are very far of the attractor, a long succession of intermediate stages is required before leading to the steady-state. A remarkable exception to this rule can occur at low altitude, with a repellor between switching trajectories towards two attractors, corresponding to a threshold between scarcely and densely wooded pastures. PATUMOD {{can be applied to}} simulate different management scenarios, which include changing global stock density and cutting trees or shrubs...|$|E
40|$|Agroforestry {{has long}} proved itself to provide many {{ecosystem}} services, ranging from provision of biodiversity to climate mitigation. In Switzerland, {{the region of}} Les Franches-Montagnes {{is famous for its}} large areas of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures,</b> which compose the typical mosaic structure of the landscape. Integrated management plans and typologies of the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> have been developed to better understand and manage these silvopastoral systems. However, few studies have considered their benefits to the local population and assessed their role in the landscape as an ecosystem services provider. This study aims to show how the people of the region perceive ecosystem services provision in their surrounding landscape and how the latter contributes to their well-being. To do so, a survey using public participation GIS developed for the AGFORWARD project, was answered by the inhabitants of Muriaux, one of the 13 municipalities of the district of Les Franches-Montagnes. In this survey, they were asked to map different ecosystem services indicators on web-based maps of the region.

However, the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> do not seem to hold more importance than other elements of the landscape in the provision of the latter. Answers to additional question of the survey suggest that the contribution of the landscape to personal well- being is mainly based on people-landscape relationships, such as tranquility and space and on social interaction between the inhabitants.

40|$|Vast {{areas of}} central Saskatchewan are {{occupied}} by aspen groves, aspen forest and mixed-wood (Rowe, 1959). A {{part of the}} aspen forest has been cleared and is now utilized as pastures. These pastures may {{be referred to as}} 'wooded', 'bushland' or 'northern wooded' pastures. Though, historically, the utilization of the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> {{can be traced back to}} the times of early settlers, their development as government sponsored pasture dates back to the early 1940 's. While the first government community pasture in the grassland zone was established in 1922 at Matador (Moen, 1964), it was not until 1941 that a community pasture was set up at Beaver Hills in the forest zone. By the early 1950 's it became obvious that the livestock industry was being greatly hampered by insufficient grazing facilities. The pastures in the grassland region could not cope with the increasing demand for grazing needs due to low carrying capacity as a result of frequent droughts. In the northern fringe of settlement there were still present vast areas of unutilized submarginal lands under aspen forest. The soil under aspen forest is podzolic, often low in fertility, of sandy texture, stony and poorly drained in low lying areas so that its tillage for cereal crops was not feasible. The importance of <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> would further increase with the rising demand of beef production. Haase (1964) has outlined the need and importance of increased forage production in Canada. He suggested that an additional 15 million acres of improved land would be needed by 1980. The investigators in various fields discussed effectively the problems and needed fields of study in the establishment of northern <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> in a meeting on "The development of pasture from bushlands in western Canada" under the auspecies of Canada Department of Agriculture in 1964.

The present study was undertaken primarily to consider the effect of grazing on herbaceous vegetation in <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> This involved the selection and study of comparable grazed and ungrazed stands under three different 'habitat' types: forest; forest, cleared; and forest, cleared, ploughed and seeded.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess separately or in combination the effect of these factors on the potential activities of soil microbial communities and to compare these effects with those of soil properties and plant composition or biomass. Controlled treatments simulating the three factors were applied in a fenced area including a light gradient (sunny and shady situation) : (i) repeated mowing; (ii) trampling; (iii) fertilizing with a liquid mixture of dung and urine. In the third year of the experiment, community level physiological profiles (CLPP) (Biolog Ecoplates¿) were measured for each plots. Furthermore soil chemical properties (pH, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus), plant species composition and plant biomass were also assessed. Despite differences in plant communities and soil properties, the metabolic potential of the microbial community in the sunny and in the shady situations were similar. Effects of treatments on microbial communities were more pronounced in the sunny than in the shady situation. In both cases, repeated mowing was the first factor retained for explaining functional variations. In contrast, fertilizing was not a significant factor. The vegetation explained a high proportion of variation of the microbial community descriptors in the sunny situation, while no significant variation appeared under shady condition. The three components of cattle activities influenced differently the soil microbial communities and this depended on the light conditions within the <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture.</b> Cattle activities may also change spatially at a fine scale and short-term and induce changes in the microbial community structure.

40|$|The loss of {{biodiversity}} {{has become a}} matter of urgent concern and a better understanding of local drivers is crucial for conservation. Although environmental heterogeneity is recognized as an important determinant {{of biodiversity}}, this has rarely been tested using field data at management scale. We propose and provide evidence for the simple hypothesis that local species diversity is related to spatial environmental heterogeneity. Species partition the environment into habitats. Biodiversity is therefore expected to be influenced by two aspects of spatial heterogeneity: 1) the variability of environmental conditions, which will affect the number of types of habitat, and 2) the spatial configuration of habitats, which will affect the rates of ecological processes, such as dispersal or competition. Earlier, simulation experiments predicted that both aspects of heterogeneity will influence plant species richness at a particular site. For the first time, these predictions were tested for plant communities using field data, which we collected in a <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> in the Swiss Jura mountains using a four-level hierarchical sampling design. Richness generally increased with increasing environmental variability and "roughness" (i. e. decreasing spatial aggregation). Effects occurred at all scales, but the nature of the effect changed with scale, suggesting a change in the underlying mechanisms, which will need {{to be taken into account}} if scaling up to larger landscapes. Although we found significant effects of environmental heterogeneity, other factors such as history could also be important determinants. If a relationship between environmental heterogeneity and species richness can be shown to be general, recently available high-resolution environmental data can be used to complement the assessment of patterns of local richness and improve the prediction of the effects of land use change based on mean site conditions or land use history...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe uptake of cadmium (Cd) was {{analyzed}} for six different perennial plant species growing in a <b>wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> of the Swiss Jura Mountains, where the soils are geogenically enriched in Cd (4. 58 mg·kg− 1 on average (n = 36); maximal value: 16. 3 mg·kg− 1). The six selected plants — Hypericum maculatum (Hypericaceae), Alchemilla xanthochlora (Rosaceae), Cynosurus cristatus (Poaceae), Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae), Dactylis glomerata (Poaceae) and Acer pseudoplatanus (Sapindaceae) — show variable Cd contents among the species and among {{individuals from the}} same family (Poaceae). Average Cd concentrations in the selected plants are in the 2 – 6 mg·kg− 1 range and exceed the maximal Cd concentration tolerated in vegetal feed for animals, which is established at 1 mg·kg− 1. High Cd concentrations in the soil result in a reduction of Cd accumulation in the shoots and a corresponding increase in the roots. This implies that Cd transfer coefficients from the soil/rhizosphere to the plant are inversely proportional to the total Cd concentrations in soils and do not depend on plant species but instead on soil type. Sequential chemical extractions reveal that variations in Cd distribution between the bulk soil and the corresponding rhizospheric soil occur mainly in the Cd-bearing phases, which are exchangeable, bound to carbonates, and associated with organic matter. This is principally due to the incorporation of root exudates, which modify pH and redox conditions of the rhizosphere. Elevated Cd concentrations in the shoots of A. xanthochlora (up to 8 mg·kg− 1), C. cristatus (9 mg·kg− 1) and H. maculatum (3 mg·kg− 1) may represent a long-term hazard for livestock and human health since these plants are used either by grazing cattle or for medicinal purposes. On the contrary, R. acris, A. pseudoplatanus, and especially D. glomerata show lower Cd concentrations and are of minor concern with regards to their environmental impact...|$|E

40|$|<b>Wooded</b> <b>pasture</b> {{and older}} forest with dead trees, about 10 % {{of an area}} of 3000 ha in {{the central part of}} the parish of Stenbrohult, was {{inventoried}} for wood-living beetles in 1985 - 2002. In the study areas Carl Linnaeus was born in 1707, and he spent his summers there until 1728. All standard methods for finding wood-beetles were used, including many window traps and 170 wood mould samples. As a new method, from 1992 and later, fragments in wood mould in hollow trees were collected and determined to species in the laboratory. We found 74 red-listed wood-beetles, including 13 threatened species (categories EN and VU). The highest numbers of threatened wood-beetles were found on properties owned by the church or by the largest landowners. This was because old (> 150 years), southern deciduous trees were largely absent on small farm properties. Recorded habitats in the study area for the red-listed species are given. Old hollow oaks Quercus robur, beeches Fagus sylvatica, small-leaved limes Tilia cordata, elms Ulmus glabra and big dead birches Betula spp. were the most important substrates for threatened species in the study area. These substrates, mainly old living trees but also standing dead trees, are also crucial habitats for species listed as possibly globally threatened and found in the study area: Corticeus fasciatus, Ptenidium gressneri, Plectophloeus nitidus, Oxypoda arborea, Gnorimus nobilis, Ampedus hjorti, Athous mutilatus, Procraerus tibialis, Xylophilus corticalis, Grynocharis oblonga, Cryptophagus fuscicornis, C. labilis, Latridius brevicollis, Mycetophagus populi, Hypulus quercinus. Mycetochara axillaris. Phloeophagus lignarius and P. thomsoni. Threats to the long-term survival of the red-listed species are discussed. The need for rapid habitat restoration to lower the "extinction debt" is stressed. This is especially urgent for features that have declined most since Linnaeus time, e. g. old sun-exposed oaks and other southern deciduous trees. The number of big dead spruces has probably increased in recent decades, and therefore species dependent on spruce are unlikely to be part of the extinction debt...|$|E

40|$|Seminatural grasslands i. e. the {{floodplain}} meadows, seashore meadows, wooded meadows, dry meadows, <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> {{are the very}} traditional part of Estonian landscapes, which {{play an important role}} in the appearance of the landscape in general and also serve as an important habitat for many plant and animal species. In order to preserve the seminatural grasslands continuous annual mowing and/or pasturing is needed. This activity is not economically profitable and needs subsidizing. The authors of the work raise a hypothesis that the Estonian seminatural grasslands could be viewed as a valuable non-market environmental good for which a significant public demand exists. In order to find out the non-market value of the seminatural grasslands a contingent valuation study was carried out among the Estonian working-age population (size of the sample 1061 individuals). The average individual willingness to pay was 11. 3 euros. During the study, the authors constructed the total demand function and discovered that the total annual demand for seminatural grasslands was 17. 9 million euros...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean savannas are landscapes with a {{continuous}} herbaceous cover and scattered trees. Savannas are usually intermingled with patches of woodland, shrub-land, tree-less grasslands, and crop-lands forming a complex mosaic. Heterogeneity in topography, soil and climate, interac-tions among species, and the superimposed selective activ-ity of wild and domestic herbivores, {{in addition to}} human activities such as clearing, ploughing and burning are main agents forging this type of landscape. Oaks are the dominant trees in the <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> (called dehesas or montados) of the Iberian Peninsula (west Mediterranean Basin) and in the savannas of Cali-fornia (northwest America). However trees and shrubs belonging to many taxonomic groups may form savanna-like systems in other regions with Mediterranean climate. These include Juniperus sp. and Retama sphaerocarpa in Spain, Pistacia atlantica and Ceratonia siliqua in north Af-rica, Acacia caven in Chile, other Acacia species in central Africa, Protea nitida in south Africa and Eucalyptus sp. in Australia.

40|$|The {{theme of}} my thesis is {{analysis}} {{and evaluation of}} development of wood pastures at several locations in the Elbe lowlands from {{the first half of}} 19 th century up to the present. The area is characterized by its fertility and the large share of arable land. The data analysis was developed using a geographic information system (GIS). The basic documents were maps and written operate of Stationary cadaster. The results of the work are map compositions depicting the change trajectories of wood pastures (extinct, continuous and new), graphs show the area of individual trajectories and evaluate the utility of written operate of the Stacionary cadastre. We have put the obtained information about the natural and social-economic development of the area into context. We got a possible explanation of development, therefore, why the old <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures</b> vanish and new ones arisen elsewhere. Changes of wood pastures were influenced by socio-economic development of the area and probably by distance from a watercourse. The informations obtained from written operate of Stacionary cadaster are useless for this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Browsing by {{livestock}} {{has been}} identi-fied {{as an important}} factor preventing tree regen-eration in <b>wooded</b> <b>pastures.</b> Two field experiments were performed to investigate the effects of cattle browsing on tree sapling growth in a mountain-wooded pasture. Two size classes (ca. 12 – 17 cm and 41 – 59 cm) of each of 4 species (Picea abies, Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylv-atica) were exposed to zero, low and high grazing intensities. We measured the proportion of sap-lings browsed {{and the effect of}} browsing on growth. A mowing treatment within the zero grazing intensity treatment showed no significant effect on sapling growth. One percent of the large saplings but 25 % of the small saplings escaped browsing. Saplings were better protected when surrounded by taller vegetation. The proportion of saplings browsed was not significantly different among species although evergreen tree saplings lost a larger proportion of biomass than deciduous species when browsed. Under grazing, average current-year shoot production and total above-ground biomass of all species were significantly reduced. Browsing effects tended to be smaller at the lower grazing intensity. Because the deciduous species were least reduced in aboveground growth, especially under the low grazing intensity, we conclude that at least in short-term, deciduous species are less affected by cattle browsing...|$|R
