2500|$|... 2001 {{marked the}} next great {{technological}} leap for storm chasers as the first Wi-Fi units began to emerge offering wireless broadband service in many cases for free. Some places (restaurants, motels, libraries, etc.) were known to reliably offer wireless access and <b>wardriving</b> located other availabilities. In 2002 the first Windows-based package to combine GPS positioning and Doppler radar appeared called SWIFT WX. SWIFT WX allowed storm chasers to seamlessly position themselves accurately relative to tornadic storms.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{phenomenon}} is <b>wardriving,</b> the searching for wireless networks (Wi-Fi) from a moving vehicle. <b>Wardriving</b> {{was named after}} wardialing, since both techniques involve actively scanning to find computer networks. The aim of <b>wardriving</b> is to collect information about wireless access points (not {{to be confused with}} piggybacking).|$|E
50|$|<b>Wardriving</b> is the act {{of searching}} for Wi-Fi {{wireless}} networks by {{a person in a}} moving vehicle, using a laptop or smartphone. Software for <b>wardriving</b> is freely available on the Internet.|$|E
50|$|Warbiking or warcycling {{is similar}} to <b>wardriving,</b> but is done from a moving bicycle or motorcycle. This {{practice}} is sometimes facilitated by mounting a Wi-Fi enabled device on the vehicle. Warwalking, or warjogging, {{is similar to}} <b>wardriving,</b> but is done on foot rather than from a moving vehicle. Warrailing, or wartraining, is similar to <b>wardriving,</b> but is done on a train or tram. Wardroning is accomplished with a drone.|$|E
50|$|Wireless {{networking}} — A {{technique of}} mapping and uploading the exact or accurate {{location of a}} wireless network is called <b>wardriving.</b> It uses signal-strength data from the wireless adapter and GPS to identify the location. Kismet for Linux is a widely used <b>wardriving</b> program.|$|E
50|$|The tiny design {{makes them}} ideal for mobile {{applications}} such as <b>wardriving.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Wardriving</b> is {{a common}} method of {{wireless}} network reconnaissance. A well-equipped wardriver uses a laptop computer with a wireless card, an antenna mounted on the car, a power inverter, a connected GPS receiver, and can connect to the internet wirelessly. The purpose of <b>wardriving</b> is to locate a wireless network and to collect information about its configuration and associated clients.|$|E

50|$|Piggybacking is {{distinct}} from <b>wardriving,</b> which involves only the logging or mapping {{of the existence of}} access points.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wardriving</b> & Wireless Penetration Testing - A brief {{account of}} the history of WLAN {{vulnerabilities}} is presented on pages 280-281.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} homebrew <b>wardriving</b> {{applications}} for handheld game consoles that support Wi-Fi, such as sniff jazzbox/wardive for the Nintendo DS/Android, Road Dog for the Sony PSP, WiFi-Where for the iPhone, G-MoN, Wardrive, Wigle Wifi for Android, and WlanPollution for Symbian NokiaS60 devices. There also exists a mode within Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops for the Sony PSP (wherein the player {{is able to}} find new comrades by searching for wireless access points) {{which can be used}} to wardrive. Treasure World for the DS is a commercial game in which gameplay wholly revolves around <b>wardriving.</b>|$|E

50|$|Common topics include <b>wardriving,</b> lockpicking, {{corporate}} and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, {{as well as}} general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as hackathons.|$|E
50|$|Ekoparty {{was founded}} in 2001 by Juan Pablo Daniel Borgna, Leonardo Pigner, Federico Kirschbaum, Jerónimo Basaldúa and Francisco Amato. In {{addition}} to the talks, Ekoparty has different activities like workshops, wargames, <b>Wardriving,</b> Lockpicking challenges, and forensics challenges.|$|E
50|$|At this point, unlike <b>Wardriving</b> no {{software}} or {{techniques are}} publicly available to enable Warzapping by casual computer users. It is predicted that, {{with the rise}} in popularity of remote disabling devices, such software will soon become available.|$|E
50|$|Passive, listen-only <b>wardriving</b> (with {{programs}} like Kismet or KisMAC) does not communicate {{at all with}} the networks, merely logging broadcast addresses. This can be likened to listening to a radio station {{that happens to be}} broadcasting in the area.|$|E
50|$|Warflying or warstorming is an {{activity}} consisting of using {{an airplane and}} a Wi-Fi-equipped computer, such as a laptop or a PDA, to detect Wi-Fi wireless networks. Warstorming shares similarities to <b>Wardriving</b> and Warwalking in all aspects except for the method of transport.|$|E
50|$|Skyhook {{was founded}} in 2003 by Ted Morgan and Michael Shean. Skyhook’s {{database}} was initially gathered through <b>wardriving,</b> when the company sent teams of drivers around the United States, Canada, Western Europe and selected Asian countries to map out Wi-Fi hot spots.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{is formed}} by analogy to <b>wardriving,</b> the {{practice}} of driving around an area in a car to detect open Wi-Fi nodes. That term in turn is based on wardialing, {{the practice of}} dialing many phone numbers {{hoping to find a}} modem.|$|E
50|$|Warrailing, or Wartraining, {{is similar}} to <b>wardriving,</b> but is done on a train or tram rather than from a slower more {{controllable}} vehicle. The disadvantages of this method are higher speed of travel (resulting in fewer and more infrequently discovered networks), and often limited routes.|$|E
50|$|Piggybacking {{has become}} a {{widespread}} practice {{in the 21st century}} due to the advent of wireless Internet connections and Wireless access points. Computer users who either do not have their own connections or who are outside the range of their own might find someone else's by <b>wardriving</b> or luck and use that one.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} side events {{has been an}} annual part of the conference, such as <b>Wardriving,</b> Lockpick Village, Capture The Flag, an [...] "unofficial" [...] Shooting event, Crypto Challenges, LAN gaming, Guitar Hero battle, Ham Radio, Crypto Key Signing, Vintage Tech Museum, etc. The Con {{generally}} closes with a game of Hacker Trivia.|$|E
50|$|Some portray <b>wardriving</b> as a {{questionable}} practice (typically from {{its association with}} piggybacking), though, from a technical viewpoint, everything is working as designed: many access points broadcast identifying data accessible to anyone with a suitable receiver. It could be compared to making a map of a neighborhood's house numbers and mail box labels.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{laws that}} {{specifically}} prohibit or allow <b>wardriving,</b> though many localities have laws forbidding unauthorized access of computer networks and protecting personal privacy. Google created a privacy storm {{in some countries}} after it eventually admitted systematically but surreptitiously gathering WiFi data while capturing video footage and mapping data for its Street View service. It has since been using Android-based mobile devices to gather this data.|$|E
5000|$|Kiwicon 6 {{was on the}} 17th and 18 November 2012, {{again at}} the Wellington Opera House. Talk topics included: {{hacktivist}} communities, measuring security, security lifecycle, one-time audio passwords, Bluetooth sniffing, biohacking, phishing, stealth web application reconnaissance, remote wiping smartphones connecting to Exchange, a social network monitoring tool, and a <b>wardriving</b> motorcycle. In reference to a joke from the previous year, a homebrew beer labelled [...] "cyberwar" [...] was given to volunteers and sold at the afterparty.|$|E

SWIFT WX allowed storm chasers to seamlessly position themselves accurately relative to tornadic storms.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to war dialing is a {{port scan}} under TCP/IP, which [...] "dials" [...] every TCP port of every IP address {{to find out}} what {{services}} are available. Unlike wardialing, however, a port scan will generally not disturb a human being when it tries an IP address, regardless of whether there is a computer responding on that address or not. Related to <b>wardriving</b> is warchalking, the practice of drawing chalk symbols in public places to advertise the availability of wireless networks.|$|E
50|$|Kiwicon IV {{was once}} again held on the weekend of 27th-28 November 2010 at Victoria University of Wellington, and sold out even earlier than in 2009. The title was a play on the term Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse. Some talk topics included: a survey of unpatched devices {{connected}} to the internet, fast data erasure, urban exploration, web scraping, <b>wardriving</b> with Arduino, New Zealand's proposed Search and Surveillance Act, and attacks on: RFID tags, Internet exchange points, Amazon Kindle, Microsoft Office and Java serialization.|$|E
50|$|While {{cooperating}} with authorities, he {{was said to}} have masterminded the hacking of TJX Companies in which 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18-month period ending in 2007, topping the 2005 breach of 40 million records at CardSystems Solutions. Gonzalez and 10 others sought targets while <b>wardriving</b> and seeking vulnerabilities in wireless networks along U.S. Route 1 in Miami. They compromised cards at BJ's Wholesale Club, DSW, Office Max, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority and T.J. Maxx.|$|E
50|$|Netstumbler is {{a network}} {{discovery}} program for Windows. It is free. Netstumbler {{has become one}} of the most popular programs for <b>wardriving</b> and wireless reconnaissance, although it has a disadvantage. It can be detected easily by most wireless intrusion detection systems, because it actively probes a network to collect information. Netstumbler has integrated support for a GPS unit. With this support, Netstumbler displays GPS coordinate information next to the information about each discovered network, which can be useful for finding specific networks again after having sorted out collected data.|$|E
50|$|Recreational {{logging and}} mapping of other people's access points {{has become known}} as <b>wardriving.</b> Indeed, many access points are {{intentionally}} installed without security turned on {{so that they can be}} used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the ISP. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and case law differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave graffiti describing available services was called warchalking. A Florida court case determined that owner laziness was not to be a valid excuse.|$|E
5000|$|F-Secure {{discovered}} that the data is transmitted to Apple twice a day and postulate that Apple is using the information to construct their global location database {{similar to the ones}} constructed by Google and Skyhook through <b>wardriving.</b> Nevertheless, unlike the Google [...] "Latitude" [...] application, which performs a similar task on Android phones, the file is not dependent upon signing a specific EULA or even the user's knowledge, but it is stated in the 15,200 word-long terms and conditions of the iPhone that [...] "Apple and their partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of user's Apple computer or device".|$|E
5000|$|With {{other types}} of software, such as NetStumbler, the wardriver {{actively}} sends probe messages, and the access point responds per design. The legality of active <b>wardriving</b> is less certain, since the wardriver temporarily becomes [...] "associated" [...] with the network, even though no data is transferred. Most access points, when using default [...] "out of the box" [...] security settings, are intended to provide wireless access to all who request it. The war driver's liability may be reduced by setting the computer to a static IP, instead of using DHCP, preventing the network from granting the computer an IP address or logging the connection.|$|E
50|$|Warkitting is a {{combination}} of <b>wardriving</b> and rootkitting. In a warkitting attack, a hacker replaces the firmware of an attacked router. This allows them to control all traffic for the victim, and could even permit them to disable SSL by replacing HTML content as it is being downloaded. Warkitting was identified by Tsow, Jakobsson, Yang, and Wetzel in 2006. Their discovery indicated that 10% of the wireless routers were susceptible to WAPjacking (malicious configuring of the firmware settings, but making no modification on the firmware itself) and 4.4% of wireless routers were vulnerable to WAPkitting (subverting the router firmware). Their analysis showed that the volume of credential theft possible through Warkitting exceeded the estimates of credential theft due to phishing.|$|E
50|$|Warwalking, or warjogging, {{is similar}} to <b>wardriving,</b> but is done on foot rather than from a moving vehicle. The {{disadvantages}} of this method are slower speed of travel (resulting in fewer and more infrequently discovered networks) {{and the absence of}} a convenient computing environment. Consequently, handheld devices such as pocket computers, which can perform such tasks while users are walking or standing, have dominated this practice. Technology advances and developments in the early 2000s expanded the extent of this practice. Advances include computers with integrated Wi-Fi, rather than CompactFlash (CF) or PC Card (PCMCIA) add-in cards in computers such as Dell Axim, Compaq iPAQ and Toshiba pocket computers starting in 2002. More recently, the active Nintendo DS and Sony PSP enthusiast communities gained Wi-Fi abilities on these devices. Further, many newer smartphones integrate Wi-Fi and Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|E
5000|$|From Hacking for Dummies [...] to Introduction to Neography, [...] WiGLE is a {{well known}} {{resource}} and tool. As early as 2004, its database of 228,000 wireless networks was being used to advocate better security of Wifi. Several books mentioned the WiGLE database in 2005, [...] including internationally, [...] and the association with vehicles was also becoming widely known. [...] Some associations of WiGLE have been positive, and some have been darker. [...] By 2004, the site was sufficiently well known that the announcement {{of a new book}} quoted the co-founder, saying “This is the ‘Kama Sutra’ of <b>wardriving</b> literature. If you can’t wardrive after reading this, nature has selected you not to. This is the first complete guide on the subject we’ve ever seen (it mentions us). Don’t quote me on that.”-Bob “bobzilla” Hagemann, WiGLE.net CoFounder" [...] and a shortened quote appeared on the book's cover.|$|E
