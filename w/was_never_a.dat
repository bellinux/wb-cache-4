5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E

5|$|The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, {{formed in}} 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, {{operated}} in the copper market as OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> member; it was dissolved in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} assault lasted {{less than}} an hour. The supporting attack by Wilcox and Lang on Pickett's right <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> factor; they did not approach the Union line until after Pickett was defeated, and their advance was quickly broken up by McGilvery's guns and by the Vermont Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{levels of}} the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738, although it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> heavily populated site. In the 9thcentury there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the abandonment of the city.|$|E

5|$|A stone pier {{was built}} in 1858 by the Somerset Central Railway. Soon afterwards, in 1860, a steamer service to Wales was inaugurated, but it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} success, and ended in 1888. Burnham-on-Sea railway station was the terminus of the Burnham branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It opened in 1858, closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951, and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. The former Great Western Railway station {{is now known as}} Highbridge and Burnham. A second pier, built of concrete between 1911 and 1914, is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

5|$|Although he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> {{vigorous}} apologist {{for that}} tradition, he always maintained {{the standards of}} clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|An {{assistant}} of LeHand's, Grace Tully, {{took over}} as Roosevelt's secretary, but <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> companion for Roosevelt {{in the same way}} as LeHand had been. After Missy departed the White House, she never saw FDR again, though he did keep in touch with letters, phone calls and by sending gifts. In the fall of 1941, FDR rewrote his will to leave half of the annual income from his estate (which was eventually probated at more than $3 million) for LeHand's care, and half to Eleanor. The will stated that upon LeHand's death the income would go to Eleanor, with the principal eventually divided equally among his children. As LeHand died before FDR, her half reverted to Eleanor.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.|$|E

5|$|Hammond was {{involved}} with several businesses. In 1933, to ease his financial concerns, {{he took a job}} with the Cater Motor Company. He was used as a sales promotions manager, which mainly involved publicity and meeting customers, although he also test-drove cars. Taking a job with Marsham Tyres in 1937 enabled him to become an amateur cricketer. He joined the board of directors and was again used for publicity, but he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> hard worker or determined salesman. Returning to Marsham's after he was discharged from the RAF in 1944, he supplemented his income by working as a journalist. He wrote for The Star during the 1948 Test series and penned three books with the assistance of a ghostwriter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1865, Melvin was elected prosecuting {{attorney}} of Hardy County in the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia. In 1866 he relocated to Wellsburg in Brooke County where he resumed the practice of law. He became a Republican following the war and remained affiliated with the party until his death although he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> strong partisan. In 1866, he was again elected as the prosecuting attorney for Hancock County, despite residing in Brooke County.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the small {{population}} of Ch'ol Maya in southern Petén and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, {{where the people}} were absorbed into the Q'eqchi' population. After the conquest, the colonial administration of Petén was divided between the ecclesiastical authorities in Yucatán and secular administration {{as part of the}} Captaincy General of Guatemala. There <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> strong Spanish presence in the area, which remained remote, although the Spanish built a fortress-prison, the Castillo de Arismendi; it was finished in 1700.|$|E
