25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1746, the Fairfield East Association of Ministers {{contacted}} the Church at the Unity Parish in Trumbull and advised them that Reverend Beebe was ready to become the minister at their parish. Beebe was ordained and installed at Unity Parish in May 1747. Beebe had his <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> him though, as the church had become scattered in 1744 by the conversion to Episcopacy by the last pastor, Reverend Richardson Miner. Under Beebe's leadership, 167 parishioners {{were added to the}} Unity Church rolls. Reverend Beebe's ministry in Trumbull lasted for 38 years until he died in office on September 8, 1785, in his 68th year.|$|E
25|$|The {{action in}} this year's Tour Championships {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon {{champion}} Petra Kvitová and 2008 finalist Vera Zvonareva. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets {{just a few weeks}} ago in Tokyo, Kvitová had her <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E
2500|$|The {{second half}} was {{reported}} to be a [...] "very poor exhibition of football" [...] with substitutes playing at most positions. [...] Michigan's sole points of the second half came on a fumble recovery by William Louis Day. [...] Michigan missed the extra point kicks on its final three touchdowns. [...] (Touchdowns were worth five points and goals from touchdown (or extra points) worth one point under 1898 rules.) [...] Guy Blencoe also missed a field goal from placement from the 40-yard line in the second half. [...] In assessing the team's performance, the Detroit Free Press opined that the team was green, ragged, and slow, and concluded that [...] "the coaches certainly have their <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> them {{if they are going to}} make a winning team out of the raw material at hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} attempt on Paul's life, Scott McGregor was {{introduced}} to the cast as Detective Brennan, who was placed in charge of the investigation. Brennan wasted no time in questioning the Ramsay Street residents, but he received conflicting information. Jackie Brygel from TV Week reported that Mark would have his <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> him as everyone was seemingly intent on pointing the finger at someone else. Everyone began jumping to conclusions as they had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor explained that Kate Ramsay would give Rebecca a false alibi, while Lyn would get Diana into [...] "strife" [...] and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) lands Andrew in trouble, but he would not help himself either. Channel 5 ran a poll on their website asking viewers to predict who pushed Paul and over 10,000 votes were cast. The majority of the voters thought it was someone other than the six suspects. 20% thought Diana had pushed Paul, followed by 19% who correctly guessed it was Rebecca. Declan pulled in 16% of the vote, Andrew had 14%, while Lyn drew 6%, Sonya 5% and Toadie had 1%.|$|E
2500|$|The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway’s western {{terminus}} was at Prince Rupert, {{and rail}} construction began from there in 1908. The railway construction firm of Foley, Welch and Stewart built the Distributor and the Skeena and purchased the Omineca in 1908. The latter was wrecked later that summer near Port Essington, but her machinery {{was put in}} another sternwheeler, and she was rechristened under the same name in 1909. That same year Foley, Welch and Stewart launched two more steamers, the Operator and the Conveyor, which would be piloted by Captain Con Myers and Captain Jack Shannon, respectively. These five sternwheelers had their <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> them. The construction of the railway from Prince Rupert to Hazelton {{was one of the}} most difficult sections of track that would ever be laid in North America. This [...] stretch would take nearly four years to build and would employ thousands of workers. Four of the company sternwheelers hauled material and supplies for construction, while a fifth, the Skeena, was used almost exclusively to supply food to the camps of the construction workers. Much of these supplies were provided by meatpacker Pat Burns, who had wisely anticipated this need and had a built slaughterhouse at Hazelton.|$|E

It was now necessary to demolish Bridget Bolster, and the opinion was general that if anybody could do it Mr. Chaffanbrass was the man. But there was a doggedness about Bridget Bolster which induced many to doubt whether even Chaffanbrass would be successful. Mr. Aram trusted greatly; but the bar would have preferred to stake their money on Bridget.|$|R

60|$|Of course, as fellow comrades, Scotty and I {{were called}} in for the drinking. We helped to make a hole in that fifty dollars not yet received. The afternoon, from just an {{ordinary}} common summer Sunday afternoon, became a gorgeous, purple afternoon. We all talked and sang and ranted and bragged, and ever French Frank and Nelson sent more drinks around. We lay in full sight of the Oakland water-front, and the noise of our revels attracted friends.

The UNGA on the global stage serves as a unique opportunity for mutual engagements. He notably suggested the addition of sideline meetings to focus on the discussed matters during the General Debate. Finally he called for the delegations to approach the upcoming year's work in the spirit of cooperation to make a difference and that [...] "as seen at the General Debate, the <b>work</b> is <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> us" [...] and there is then a need to take on responsibility and challenges to make a [...] "real and meaningful change."

50|$|In 1874 {{he became}} Co-Medical Officer of Health for Dublin Corporation {{and two years}} later became Chief Medical Officer. Being in charge of the Public Health Department of Dublin City meant that he was always in the public eye, and due to the level of poverty and disease in the city at the time his <b>work</b> was <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> him. He made many {{recommendations}} for improving the sanitation of dwellings and saw to it that unsanitary housing was either improved or closed down. He published numerous sanitary reports, papers on hygiene, the social life of the very poor and proper eating habits, those of the very poor in particular. On the other hand, he {{was in a position to}} meet the major figures of the day, from the monarchy and the government downwards. He was a member of several clubs in the city and dined with local and visiting celebrities alike, which he described in his reminiscences.|$|R
60|$|The {{truth of}} that was very soon in evidence. Cubby would not let well enough alone, {{and he would not}} have a slack rope. I think he wanted to choke himself or pull my arms out. When I {{realized}} that Cubby was three times as strong as I was I began to see that my <b>work</b> was <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> me. The more, however, that he jerked me and hauled me along, the more I determined to hang on. I thought I had a genuine love for him up to the time he had almost knocked my head off, but it was funny how easily he roused my anger after that. What would have happened had he taken a notion to go through the brush? Luckily he kept to the trail, which certainly was rough enough. So, with watching the cub and keeping my feet free of roots and rocks, I had no chance to look ahead. Still I had no concern about this, for the old hunter was at my heels, and I knew he would keep a sharp lookout.|$|R

40|$|The role of {{leadership}} in science fiction receives a particular analysis {{which is based on}} what can be termed transhumanist novels published in Italy between 2008 and 2013. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to answer the following question: What happens to (the nature of) leadership in a technologically-driven society? Four novels form the backbone of the description of futuristic leadership. The four conclusions drawn from this analysis regarding the nature {{of leadership}} in a technologically-driven society point to a much greater need for leadership studies to pay attention to technological advances (and the philosophical underpinnings of, specifically, transhumanism). The impact of nano-bio-technology affecting the role of leaders, followers, goals, alignment, commitment has ontological repercussions on the manner in which (augmented and unaugmented) humans deal with each other. If early augmented humans/cyborgs and any other sentient beings are in fact comparable to Giambattista Vico’s brutes, and if his corsi e ricorsi (ebbs and flows) of human history can apply to non-human, sentient beings’ history, then the <b>work</b> is <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> all disciplines, but especially for those which deal with ontologies of leadership...|$|R

40|$|This brief {{solicited}} response addresses Prof. Jacqueline Lipton 2 ̆ 7 s article 2 ̆ 2 Law of the Intermediated Information Exchange, 2 ̆ 2 {{which appeared}} in 64 Florida Law Review 1337 (2012). Prof. Lipton 2 ̆ 7 s ambitious project {{is to provide a}} unifying theory of cyberlaw, at the heart of which lies her proposal to reframe the field as a law of the global intermediated information exchange. I mainly discuss three critiques of her work. First, I raise the question of whether a significant focus on intermediaries will not inherently engender a mentality of attempting choking at the simplest choke point, whether other interests are at stake or not. Second, I argue that jurisdictional issues will remain present independent of the importance of intermediaries because we have to resolve the significant problem of legal diversity in a connected world. Third, I show that cyberlaw is not the only area of the law in which intermediaries play a key role, which raises some questions as to using the intermediary-heavy nature of the Internet as its main legal distinguishing feature. In summary, I conclude that Prof. Lipton’s piece encourages us to recognize the necessity of understanding the key role of information intermediaries, but that our <b>work</b> remains <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> us to color in the important lines that she has drawn...|$|R

[...] How the gentleman in his grave may have kept his countenance, I cannot inform you, having no acquaintance at all with the sexton; but for the other two, I take leave to assure you, there have not yet appeared the least signs of blushing or remorse in either, though some very good opportunities have offered, if they had thought fit to accept them; so that with your permission, I had rather engage to continue this work till {{they are in their}} graves too, which I am sure will happen much sooner than the other.|$|R
6000|$|And all {{the time}} I was in the Pen I was making myself solid with my pal. He had done much for me, and in return he {{expected}} me {{to do as much}} for him. When we got out, we were to travel together, and, it goes without saying, pull off [...] "jobs" [...] together. For my pal was a criminal--oh, not a jewel of the first water, merely a petty criminal who would steal and rob, commit burglary, and, if cornered, not stop short of murder. Many a quiet hour we sat and talked together. He had two or three jobs in view for the immediate future, in which my <b>work</b> was <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> me, and in which I joined in planning the details. I had been with and seen much of criminals, and my pal never dreamed that I was only fooling him, giving him a string thirty days long.

Of course I had not the slightest intention of joining him in a life of sordid, petty crime; but I'd have been an idiot to throw away all the good things his friendship made possible. When one is on the hot lava of hell, he cannot pick and choose his path, and so it was with me in the Erie County Pen.
