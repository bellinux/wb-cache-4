At the end of June 2012, textile mills employed 20% of the nation's workforce, and generated 1.3trillion rupees ($13.8billion) in textile products, most of which were exported to the US and Europe. While Punjab's economy is driven primarily by agriculture, the textile industry along <b>with</b> <b>leather</b> products and light engineering goods play an important role, with more than 48,000 industrial units spread across Punjab. In an effort to boost bilateral trade, Romania and Turkey have honorary-consulates in Faisalabad which enable trade links with the city.|$|E

5|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working <b>with</b> <b>leather</b> or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{confirmed}} that {{the site of the}} fire had been used as an illegal factory to manufacture leather bags. The factory was located {{on the third floor of}} a four-story building, which also featured residential units. Investigators determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, a situation that is not considered unusual in India. There was had just one emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away <b>with</b> <b>leather</b> goods. The building was located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district of Greater Kolkata region.|$|E
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound <b>with</b> <b>leather</b> strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of Chiprovtsi from a mining town to a trade hub owes {{much to the}} settlement of merchants from the Republic of Ragusa (today Dubrovnik, Croatia) {{and the quality of}} the local metalworking, as well as the lack of permanent Ottoman presence and the privileges enjoyed by the population. By the mid-17th century, mining was in decline, as the silver deposits had been all but exhausted (in 1666 there remained only 16 iron smelteries), forcing the population to seek a more profitable occupation. Since 1659, the Ragusan merchants from Provadiya altered their traditional route to Dubrovnik through Sofia in order to visit Chiprovtsi. The local residents produced and traded <b>with</b> <b>leather,</b> carpets, fabrics, clothes, remarkable gold and silver jewellery, metal tools, cattle, etc. Initially, the Chiprovtsi merchants would only visit Vidin, Pirot, Sofia and Vratsa. Later, however, they appeared at the markets in Istanbul, Thessaloniki, Bucharest, Odessa, BraÅov, Sibiu, Belgrade, Buda and Pest, with a particularly strong presence in Wallachia and Transylvania, where they established permanent agencies and sizable companies in TÃ¢rgoviÅte, CÃ¢mpulung and RÃ¢mnic during the rule of Matei Basarab (1632â1654). The international trade broadened the outlook of the locals and introduced the ideas of the age and the European culture of the time to the region.|$|E
