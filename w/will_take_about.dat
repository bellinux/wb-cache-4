5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
5|$|Because of Monitors {{advanced}} state of deterioration, timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical. Numerous fragile artifacts, including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns, an anchor, steam engine, and propeller, have been recovered. They were transported back to Hampton Roads to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, {{where they were}} treated in special tanks to stabilize the metal. It is reported that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> ten years for the metal to completely stabilize. The new USS Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale copy of USS Monitor, the original recovered turret, and artifacts and related items are now on display.|$|E

The other airport is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998. KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations in six continents around the world, and is the main hub for the national carrier, Malaysia Airlines and low-cost carrier, AirAsia. KLIA can be reached using the KLIA Ekspres a airport rail link service from KL Sentral, which takes twenty-eightminutes, while travelling by car or bus via highway <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> an hour.

2500|$|The Lake Jean Dam was {{constructed}} in the 1950s by the old Department of Forests and Waters. The dam was earthen and replaced an older dam. This operation combined Mud Pond with what was then Lake Jean to create the [...] lake that currently exists. While it has been maintained, various parts have deteriorated. In June 2015, the lake will be entirely drained to repair the dam's control tower. It <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> two weeks to drain the lake, though a stream of water will still flow through its deepest parts. In 2015, the project was expected to cost $800,000. Lake Jean was reopened in May 2016.|$|E
2500|$|The {{upper end}} {{is related to}} the {{stringent}} requirements of choosing keys used in encryption. [...] In 1999, an Electronic Frontier Foundation project broke 56-bit DES encryption in less than a day using specially designed hardware. In 2002, distributed.net cracked a 64-bit key in 4 years, 9 months, and 23 days. As of October 12, 2011, distributed.net estimates that cracking a 72-bit key using current hardware <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 45,579 days or 124.8 years. Due to currently understood limitations from fundamental physics, there is no expectation that any digital computer (or combination) will be capable of breaking 256-bit encryption via a brute-force attack. Whether or not quantum computers {{will be able to do}} so in practice is still unknown, though theoretical analysis suggests such possibilities.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{experts believe}} that {{hydrogen}} fuel cell cars will never become economically competitive with other technologies or {{that it will take}} decades for them to become profitable. Elon Musk stated in 2015 that fuel cells for use in cars will never be commercially viable because of the inefficiency of producing, transporting and storing hydrogen and the flammability of the gas, among other reasons. Professor Jeremy P. Meyers estimated in 2008 that cost reductions over a production ramp-up period <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 20 years after fuel-cell cars are introduced before {{they will be able to}} compete commercially with current market technologies, including gasoline internal combustion engines.

2500|$|The {{effort to}} {{handover}} security to Afghans has been hampered by {{a spike in}} attacks by local forces supposed {{to be working with}} American and NATO personnel. United States military officials suspended temporarily on 2 September 2012 the training of Afghan Local Police (ALP) {{in the wake of a}} deadly series of so-called ‘green on blue’ attacks by Afghan soldiers and police on their international allies. [...] The training has been put on hold in order to carry out intensified vetting procedures on new recruits, and 16,000 existing ALP recruits will be re-vetted. ALP training is a U.S. mission, carried out by Special Forces teams who work with Afghan elders and government officials in remote villages to help villagers defend themselves against insurgent attacks and intimidation. Training of uniformed police and army personnel is done under the banner of the NATO operation. The suspension affects not only Afghan Local Police, but also Afghan special operations and commando forces. Special Operations officials said that they anticipate it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> two months to rescreen all of the Afghan forces and that the training of new recruits could stall for as long as a month.|$|E

[...] Since 2006, [...] IDEAL won three infrastructure contracts yet it faces stiff competition {{from a number}} of other Mexican and Spanish construction companies. The number of contracts is fewer than its biggest local competitor, Empresas ICA. During the same period, Empresas obtained 18 Mexican projects valued at US$1.09billion, including airports, toll roads, hospitals and oil platforms. Some of the projects IDEAL has been awarded include the Nezahualcoyotl development, which is a landfill that was acquired for US$150million by Slim to develop a shopping mall, two schools, a hospital and a park on the site. Other contracts IDEAL has been awarded include a water-treatment plant contract, and a real estate partnership with the Mexican hospital chain Star Médica. IDEAL is also betting on one of the poorest landfills surrounding Mexico City. Slim has also planned to purchase several toll roads offered by the Mexican government that it took over from private companies following the December 1994 currency devaluation. Though speculation that the landfill <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>about</b> 12 years to yield a return, the development of a such poor area is revealed to promise handsome business profits over the years as Grupo Elektra, Mexico's largest consumer electronics retailer, sells 2,000 flat screen televisions a year at its store in the area, making it the third-best-selling outlet. Included in the development, IDEAL will also collect rent from a university, a hospital and a school that will be built around a mall, will have 178 stores, including Inditex's Zara fashion chain and Slim's Grupo Sanborns and the Mexican unit of Sears Holdings. A park in Nezahualcoyotl, {{the first of its kind}} will also be constructed. The park will comprise 34 soccer fields, 12 tennis, basketball and volleyball courts, a baseball field and a gym with a swimming pool.|$|E
