[...] The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: [...] "what really makes the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star." [...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful.

500|$|The {{prevailing}} critical {{view of the}} Beach Boys' {{early music}} changed after the 1970s, as academic Andrew Flory writes, [...] "Today , the group’s legacy in the rock press is contingent almost entirely on their experimental music ... while earlier surf-oriented albums receive little canonical attention." [...] Since the 1990s, the band has undergone a process of critical reevaluation. C.W. Mahoney of The Washington Free Beacon characterizes Wilson's appeal to the millennial indie music landscape as [...] "a Daniel Johnston who made listenable music". Love feels that the [...] "formula" [...] quote [...] "crystallizes" [...] a false theme that runs throughout the writings of Wilson's [...] "awestruck biographers": [...] "the morality tale of the tormented genius who was undone by his own family—putting commerce ahead of art—that tale was too great to resist." [...] Mahoney comments that in the 2016 memoir I Am Brian Wilson, [...] "Wilson takes the opportunity to elaborate his victim narrative, airing grievances about Mike or Murry or Carl or Dennis not always liking his creative decisions and how deeply it wounded him ...

500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E

Dave Halverson of GameFan praised Crash's animations, appearance and mannerisms as [...] "100% perfection". A reviewer for Game Revolution praised Crash's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] as [...] "always refreshing", and John Broady of GameSpot described Crash as [...] "disarmingly cute and fuzzy". Doug Perry of IGN {{was critical of}} the character, seeing him as [...] "insanely capitalistic", negatively comparing his voice to Luigi of the Mario series and accusing him of being [...] "the most see-through, copycat mascot that ever existed." [...] Louis Bedigian of GameZone also disliked Crash's voice, remarking [...] "it is really annoying to hear a child say, 'Whoa!' every time you fall in the water, especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> that the child's voice {{is supposed to be}} Crash". Crash's animations, particularly in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, have been praised as humorous by reviewers. Ryan Davis of GameSpot analyzed Crash's [...] "overextended running style and self-punishing attacks" [...] as establishing him as an [...] "empty-headed but enthusiastic character", and compared his facial contortions to those of comedian Red Skelton. In a poll held by MSN in late 2008 to determine the most iconic video game character, Crash ranked at #8. In the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition from 2011, he was voted as the eleventh best video game character. However, he also ranked eighth on IGN's top 10 list of video game characters who should die, adding {{that it would be a}} mercy killing. IGN editor Colin Moriarty stated that his games add little to innovate the series over the years, rendering the character useless.|$|E

Our marriage did not end on good terms and to make a long story short, we now have a sea of legalities between us ranging from a custody battle to felony charges for harassment and stalking, making it even harder to co-parent our three-year old son, Kristopher.

Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

As I sat alone at my breakfast--Mrs. Challenger is in the habit of keeping her room of a morning--it suddenly entered my head that it would be entertaining and instructive to see whether I could find any limits to this woman's inperturbability. I devised a simple but effective experiment. Having upset a small vase of flowers which stood in the centre of the cloth, I rang the bell and slipped under the table. She entered and, seeing the room empty, imagined that I had withdrawn to the study. As I had expected, she approached and leaned over the table to replace the vase. I had a vision of a cotton stocking and an elastic-sided boot. Protruding my head, I sank my teeth into the calf of her leg. The experiment was successful beyond belief. For some moments she stood paralyzed, staring down at my head. Then with a shriek she tore herself free and rushed from the room. I pursued her with some thoughts of an explanation, but she flew down the drive, and some minutes afterwards I was able to pick her out with my field-glasses traveling very rapidly in a south-westerly direction.
