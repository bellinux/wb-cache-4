40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline two {{suggestions}} for making existing democratic institutions in Hong Kong more effective. First, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>placing</b> {{more responsibility for}} policy-making at the District Council level, so as to provide greater stakes in District Council elections. Second, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> similarly increasing the stakes in LegCo elections by having some Principal Officials be appointed from LegCo based on the electoral success of their party’s platform – or (if current law is interpreted to prevent LegCo members from serving in the executive) by having each electorally-significant party nominate people associated with the party to be Principal Officials. By giving the parties that have significant electoral mandates material influence in executive policy formation, successful parties will become associated with and proponents and defenders of – rather than constantly being in opposition to – {{at least some of}} the policies being implemented by the government. This will also require the strengthening and development of Hong Kong’s political culture and its political party structures through building professional career tracks for talented politically-inclined people and through the addition of people within the major parties focused on designing party platforms through policy research, political marketing, and political strategy development. ...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by the Odlyzko root {{discriminant}} and Golod [...] Shafarevich p-group bounds, Martinet (1978) {{asked whether}} an imaginary quadratic number field K/Q must always have an infinite Hilbert 2 -class field tower when the class group of K has 2 -rank 4, or equivalently when the discriminant of K has 5 prime factors. No negative results are known. Benjamin (2001, 2002) and Sueyoshi (2004, 2009, 2010) systematically established infinite 2 -towers for many K in question, by casework on the associated Rédei matrices. Others, notably Mouhib (2010), {{have also made}} progress, but still many cases remain open, especially when the the class group of K has small 4 -rank. Recently, Benjamin (2015) made partial progress on several of these open matrices when the class group of K has 4 -rank 1 or 2. In this paper, we partially address many open cases when the 4 -rank is 0 or 2, affirmatively answering some questions of Benjamin. We then investigate barriers to our methods and ask an extension question (of independent interest) in this direction.

40|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the importance of}} accounting for detection probability have long been present in ecological literature. Various studies have demonstrated the influence of survey design on detection probabilities, and whilst the placement of camera traps along roads is a commonly used survey design, it has shown to be biased towards certain species. In arid environments, water sources {{have the potential to}} be efficient sites for camera trap placement. We compared the influence of a water source camera trap survey design on the detection probabilities of a guild of seven carnivore species, in comparison detection probabilities from camera traps along roads, on arid, commercial farmland in southern Namibia. Results showed detection probabilities for all species to be higher at water, with the water source design producing shorter latencies of detections and higher naive occupancy estimates for most species. However, for species with unique markings, the water source design produced lower proportions of images suitable for individual identification. As detection probabilities of all species were influenced in a positive manner, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>placing</b> camera traps at water sources in arid environments to be an effective survey design.

40|$|Skinks {{from the}} genera Eulamprus, Gnypetoscincus and Nangura are a {{prominent}} {{component of the}} reptile fauna of the mesic forests of {{the east coast of}} Australia and {{have been the subject of}} numerous ecological studies. Highly conserved morphology and the retention of ancestral traits have limited our understanding of the relationships within and among these genera beyond an initial identification of species groups within Eulamprus. To address this deficit and to explore the relationships between Eulamprus and the monotypic genera Nangura and Gnypetoscincus, sections of two mitochondrial genes (ND 4 and 16 S rRNA) were sequenced and subjected to Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. This phylogenetic analysis supports recognition of the three species groups proposed for Eulamprus (murrayi, quoyii and tenuis) and indicates that this genus is paraphyletic, with Gnypetoscincus and Nangura being proximal to basal lineages of the tenuis group. To resolve these and broader problems of paraphyly, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> that each of the species groups from 2 ̆ 7 Eulamprus 2 ̆ 7 should be recognised as a distinct genus. The phylogenetically and ecologically distinct water skinks of the quoyii group would be retained within Eulamprus and the diverse species of the tenuis group allocated to Concinnia. <b>We</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>placing</b> the monophyletic murrayi group, endemic to the rainforests of central eastern Australia, in a new genus (yet to be formally described). The sequencing data also revealed the existence of a genetically divergent but morphologically cryptic lineage within E. murrayi and substantial diversity within E. quoyii. There is evidence for two major habitat shifts from rainforest towards drier habitats, one leading to the quoyii group and the second defining a clade of three species within the tenuis complex. These ecological transitions may represent adaptations to general drying across eastern Australia during the late Miocene - Pliocene. Each of the major areas of east coast tropical or subtropical rainforest contains multiple phylogenetically diverse endemic species, reflecting the long-term persistence and high conservation value of wet forest habitats in each area...|$|R
40|$|Hippocampal place fields {{have been}} shown to reflect behaviorally {{relevant}} aspects of space. For instance, place fields tend to be skewed along commonly traveled directions, they cluster around rewarded locations, and they are constrained by the geometric structure of the environment. We hypothesize a set of design principles for the hippocampal cognitive map that explain how place fields represent space in a way that facilitates navigation and reinforcement learning. In particular, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>place</b> fields encode not just information about the current location, but also predictions about future locations under the current transition distribu-tion. Under this model, a variety of place field phenomena arise naturally from the structure of rewards, barriers, and directional biases as reflected in the tran-sition policy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this representation of space can support efficient reinforcement learning. We also propose that grid cells compute the eigendecomposition of place fields in part because is useful for segmenting an enclosure along natural boundaries. When applied recursively, this segmentation can be used to discover a hierarchical decomposition of space. Thus, grid cells might be involved in computing subgoals for hierarchical reinforcement learning. ...|$|R
40|$|Single-step {{electron}} tunnelling reactions can transport charges over {{distances of}} 15 – 20 Å in proteins. Longer-range transfer requires multi-step tunnelling processes along redox chains, {{often referred to}} as hopping. Long-range hopping via oxidized radicals of tryptophan and tyrosine, which has been identified in several natural enzymes, has been demonstrated in artificial constructs of the blue copper protein azurin. Tryptophan and tyrosine serve as hopping way stations in high-potential charge transport processes. It may be no coincidence that these two residues occur with greater-than-average frequency in O_ 2 - and H_ 2 O_ 2 -reactive enzymes. <b>We</b> <b>suggest</b> that appropriately <b>placed</b> tyrosine and/or tryptophan residues prevent damage from high-potential reactive intermediates by reduction followed by transfer of the oxidizing equivalent to less harmful sites or out of the protein altogether...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} research, meeting {{places have}} been favourably addressed by service users, {{but they have}} also been contested as exclusionary. In this participatory explorative study, we sought to perform a contextual analysis of meeting places in Norway based on a discourse analysis of three focus group discussions with 15 staff members. We asked the following question: how do meeting-place employees discuss their concrete and abstract encounters with service users and their experiences? We focused on service user involvement, which was largely analysed as neoliberal consultation and responsibilisation. Service users were positioned as resisting responsibility trickling down and defending staffed meeting places. Social democratic discourse was identified in the gaps of neoliberal discourse, which is noteworthy given that Norway is a social democracy. This relates to global concerns about displacements of democracy. <b>We</b> <b>suggest</b> that meeting <b>places</b> appear to hold the potential for staff and service users to collaborate more democratically...|$|R

40|$|Schools have {{received}} less attention from geographers than {{institutions such as}} the clinic and the hospital – despite the fact that, for most people, encounters with sites of medicine are rarer than encounters with sites of education.

In this article, we provide an introduction to, and review of, the literature that takes seriously the sociospatial dimensions of schooling. Our discussion is organized around two central themes: first, the organization of school space, and the ways in which it is implicated in issues of power, and the reproduction of preferred identities; second, the linkages between schools and broader communities, and what these tell us about the values and aspirations attached to schooling.

40|$|Abstract Background The Chaetognatha (arrow worms) are a {{group of}} marine {{carnivores}} whose phylogenetic relationships are still vigorously debated. Molecular studies have as yet failed {{to come up with}} a stable hypothesis on their phylogenetic position. In a wide range of metazoans, the nervous system has proven to provide a wealth of characters for analysing phylogenetic relationships (neurophylogeny). Therefore, in the present study we explored the structure of the ventral nerve centre ("ventral ganglion") in Sagitta setosa with a set of histochemical and immunohistochemical markers. Results In specimens that were immunolabeled for acetylated-alpha tubulin the ventral nerve centre appeared to be a condensed continuation of the peripheral intraepidermal nerve plexus. Yet, synapsin immunolocalization showed that the ventral nerve centre is organized into a highly ordered array of ca. 80 serially arranged microcompartments. Immunohistochemistry against RFamide revealed a set of serially arranged individually identifiable neurons in the ventral nerve centre that we charted in detail. Conclusion The new information on the structure of the chaetognath nervous system is compared to previous descriptions of the ventral nerve centre which are critically evaluated. Our findings are discussed with regard to the debate on nervous system organisation in the last common bilaterian ancestor and with regard to the phylogenetic affinities of this Chaetognatha. <b>We</b> <b>suggest</b> to <b>place</b> the Chaetognatha within the Protostomia and argue against hypotheses which propose a deuterostome affinity of Chaetognatha or a sister-group relationship to all other Bilateria. </p...|$|R
40|$|Because coyotes (Canis latrans) show {{an aversion}} to novel objects, we {{examined}} the effects of the presence and removal of repellent and attractive stimuli on coyote behavior. We found a greater proportion of captive coyotes investigated 10 -cm-tall cones (0. 95) compared to 90 -cm-tall cones (0. 68) and control sites (0. 81), and spent longer periods (P, 0. 001 in all instances) investigating small cones (x̅ = 465 sec), compared to large cones (x̅ = 212 sec) and control sites (x̅ = 45 sec). However, investigation times at sites following removal of large cones were 1. 6 and 2. 3 times greater than investigation times at sites following removal of small cones and the control, respectively. Results from pen studies were supported by a field study. Wild coyotes in south Texas visited 43 % of small cones but did not visit large cones. Following removal of cones, visits to small cone stations decreased to 29 %, whereas coyotes visited 43 % of large cone stations. Thus, we observed a direct relationship between aversion toward large novel objects and subsequent attraction to sites following their removal among both captive and wild coyotes. Based upon our results, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>placing</b> large novel objects over traps that are set and removing such objects after a few days, with the subsequent addition of an olfactory attractant, may increase exploratory behavior and capture of coyotes...|$|R
30|$|Microfinance is the {{provision}} of financial services to the financially excluded, usually the poor. We use literature reviews and descriptive research to present {{different aspects of the}} relationship of the microfinancial services to microenterprise. The first thrust in this field had been from microcredit and group lending to encourage business initiatives among the poor. The hope that these services would lift them out of poverty had largely built the brand image of the sector. However, the spread of consumer microcredit and uncontrolled growth of microfinance led to over-lending without adequate checks and balances, leading to over-indebtedness and associated stress, and critique of microcredit. To restore balance, other financial products, such as microequity, microsavings, microinsurance, microguarantees, and microremittances, have been <b>suggested.</b> <b>We</b> <b>place</b> these developments in a social innovation process perspective by showing that microfinance, through its wide range of innovatively distributed products, can be a key factor to foster entrepreneurship.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to propose}} {{a new line of}} {{research}} that explores the relationship between residents and destination brand building behaviours through the concept of place attachment. Design and methodology – We conducted a literature review on place attachment and brand building behaviour, and focused more specifically on place identity as an accumulation based dimension of place attachment and word-of-mouth as a behavioural outcome. Approach – With the emergence of new technologies, tourism managers no longer have a complete control over the development of destination brand, since various communication tools enable for residents to engage in the destination branding process. This calls for rethinking the role of residents in destination branding and the necessity to explore various place attachment dimensions and their outcomes. Findings – This study proposes a conceptual framework to understand the role of residents {{in the construction of the}} image of their place of residence as a tourism destination. Within this framework, <b>we</b> <b>suggested</b> that <b>place</b> satisfaction may affect residents’ internalisation process, contributing to residents’ behavioural output process, resulting in positive word-of-mouth, participation in tourism activities, and demonstration of destination ambassador behaviour. Originality – Despite the wide interest of researchers in human-place relationship, few studies have focused on residents’ place attachment and its outcomes. This framework suggests that it is important to understanding how residents form place attachment; how they perceive their place of residence as a tourism destination, and what they communicate in order to create positive destination image and strong destination brand...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Pernambuco Endemism Center in {{north-east}} Brazil has {{the most}} fragmented forest cover and {{the largest number of}} threatened birds of the whole Atlantic Forest. We analyzed the distribution of three groups of bird species: forest-dependent, endemic and/or threatened using the interpolation method of Inverse Distance Weighting. We also checked the concentration of these birds in protected and unprotected areas, suggesting new sites that need to be protected. The richness concentration of forest-dependent, endemic and/or threatened birds in 123 sites were analysed. There was a greater concentration of the three groups in north Alagoas, south and north Pernambuco, and north and west Paraíba. The distribution of the three groups was almost regular in different vegetation types, although a lower concentration was found in the pioneer formation. There was a greater concentration of birds from all three groups between Pernambuco and Alagoas, and this must be due to the presence of more forest fragments with better structure and vegetation heterogeneity. The protected and unprotected areas hosted important records of endemic and/or threatened birds. <b>We</b> <b>suggested</b> some important <b>places</b> for implementation of new protected areas due to the larger concentrations of the target birds and because they are located within the boundaries of the Important Bird Areas...|$|R
40|$|While {{there is}} almost {{universal}} agreement amongst researchers that autism {{is associated with a}}lterations in brain connectivity, the precise nature of these alterations continues to be debated. Theoretical and empirical work is beginning to reveal that autism is associated with a complex functional phenotype characterized by both hypo- and hyper-connectivity of large-scale brain systems. It is not yet understood why such conflicting patterns of brain connectivity are observed across different studies, and the factors contributing to these heterogeneous findings have not been identified. Develoopmental changes in functional connectivity have received inadequate attention to date. We propose that discrepancies between findings of autism related hypo-connectivity and hyper-connectivity might be reconciled by taking developmental changes into account. We review neuroimaging studies of autism, with an emphasis on functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of intrinsic functional connectivity in children, adolescents and adults. The consistent pattern emerging across several studies is that while intrinsic functional connectivity in adolescents and adults with autism is generally reduced compared with age-matched controls, functional connectivity in younger children with the disorder appears to be increased. <b>We</b> <b>suggest</b> that by <b>placing</b> recent empirical findings within a developmental framework, and explicitly characterizing age and pubertal stage in future work, {{it may be possible to}} resolve conflicting findings of hypo- and hyper-connectivity in the extant literature and arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of autism...|$|R

40|$|Capsule Nightjars prefer open {{places in}} younger forest areas, and open stands with wide forest tracks in older forest areas. Aims European Nightjars are a Species of European Conservation Concern (historical declines in both {{population}} and range). The reduction of heathland habitats means that forested areas are {{an increasingly important}} habitat for Nightjars. However, the ecology of Nightjars in forested areas is poorly understood. We set out to investigate Nightjar habitat preferences in a 5000 -ha forest landscape in northern Belgium. Methods Calling ‘churring’ males were counted in each year over ten years. Habitat descriptors were derived from detailed habitat mapping based on aerial photographs and extensive field surveys. The different habitat descriptors were compared between patches occupied by Nightjars and control patches (patches selected at random in the study area). Results As expected, Nightjars showed a preference for open places in younger forest areas (clearfelled areas, young stands, windfall and permanent open places). They also showed a preference for old and open stands that had wide forest tracks. Forest type appeared not to be significant. Heath, bare sand and, to a lesser extent, leaf litter have an increased presence in patches used by Nightjars. Conclusion For the conservation of Nightjars, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> that open <b>places</b> within larger forests should be created. Also a network of wide forest tracks can make smaller patches suitable for Nightjars. Patches of bare sand should be created or maintained...|$|R

Our purpose is to define the place of rhetoric into the stylistic descriptions (which are required for a specific test, coming within these examinations), and, further, to precise with witch theoretical presuppositions, and with witch special effects on the description itself. Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> to <b>place</b> all this facts onto the "rhetoric dimension" of discourses, and more generally, in {{the perspective of the}} "enunciative praxis". This analysis is first concerned with underlining the main semantic, syntactic and enunciative categories witch link the rhetorical analysis with the stylistic one. But, on the whole, and secondly, the matter is to examine how the stylistic analysis makes the rhetorical figures significant. Our final proposition is to consider that the stylistic analysis converts each rhetorical figure, and the whole of them gathered in the text, too, in a canonical sequence composed with three stages: (1) the stage of "confrontation" between two (at least) domains or enunciative positions, (2) the stage of "enunciative assuming" witch modifies the respective weight of the confronted domains, and (3) the stage of "resolution" of the semantic conflict, which defines the conditions and the process of interpretation.
