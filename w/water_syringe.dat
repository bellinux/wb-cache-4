40|$|Background: It {{is known}} that dental unit {{waterline}} can {{be a source of}} infection. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of a mouthwash, chlorhexidine, in controlling microbial and fungal contamination of dental unit waterlines. Materials and Methods: In the present experimental study, the water in high-speed handpieces and air/water syringes of 35 dental units in a dental school was investigated microbiologically. Five of the units and one tap water served as controls; 100 - 200 -mL water samples were collected aseptically in sterile containers in the morning after a 2 -min purge. Water reservoir bottles were emptied and 50 mL of 0. 2 % chlorhexidine mouthwash was introduced into the tank. Then the <b>water</b> <b>syringe</b> was used to flush the waterline until the pink-colored chlorhexidine was observed to flow from the <b>water</b> <b>syringe.</b> Before the next day′s session and before the students used the unit, two water samples from the <b>water</b> <b>syringe</b> and water turbine was collected. The samples were transferred to the laboratory. After 48 h at 37 °C, the microbial colonies were counted. The number of these colonies was evaluated using colony forming unit CFU. Data were analyzed with Mann - Whitney U test and SPSS 13. 5 statistical program. The statistical significance was defined at P ≤ 0. 05. Results: All 35 units were contaminated before chlorhexidine use; no contamination was detected after adding chlorhexidine to the waterlines of the units. After week 1, 28 of the 30 treated dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) had values of CFU/mL less than 200. Conclusion: The present study showed that the use of chlorhexidine could reduce microbial counts in dental unit waterlines...|$|E

Ten millilitres of water was collected in a sterile container from air <b>water</b> <b>syringe</b> in the mid afternoon, once before flushing and once after flushing for two minutes. One control sample was also taken from tap in the department. The samples were then sent to department of Microbiology, Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla where they were investigated for gram positive and gram negative cocci; gram positive and gram negative bacilli. Results: No organism was detected in the control sample from tap water. The only organism that was detected was staphylococcus coagulase negative. The mean of staphylococci coagulase negative colony forming units in pre flushing sample was 1460. 89 and in post flushing sample was 1380. The difference between pre flushing and post flushing sample was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Though the organism present in water was only staphylococci coagulase negative, the level was higher than as recommended by CDC, so appropriate disinfection methods should be used, and the source of staphylococci coagulase negative should be investigated.

The purpose of this investigation was to establish the effect of two disinfectants and to test their capacity to eliminate colony forming units (CFU) per mL. Vacuum lines of four chairs were treated for a total of 2 weeks. Two disinfectants (Bio 2000 and Alpron) were used as per manufacturer’s instructions. Water samples for hetereothrophic counts from each unit’s air ⁄ <b>water</b> <b>syringe</b> line were collected before treating the first patient of the day. Baseline, daily, first and second week samples of 10 mL were plated on blood agar plates and eosin ethylene blue agar. For meosifilic bacterial counts, Mueller Hinton agar plates with 1 mL direct and 1 ⁄ 10 were used in sterile serum and CFU were counted. The suspected colonies were further evaluated using API 20 E and API 20 NE. No Gram(–) opportunistic pathogens were found during the entire observation. Baseline contamination level (> 102 CFU mL- 1) without use of disinfectants was significantly higher (P < 0 Æ 0001) than at both first and second weeks when disinfectants were used. No colony was formed when Bio 2000 was used after both first and second weeks, whereas small number of CFU mL- 1 was found {{at the end of the}} first week when Alpron (< 10) was used. In conclusion, when used daily, both disinfectants prevent the development of bacterial contamination after first and second weeks with no significant differences (P = 0 Æ 35). ...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Occlusal {{pits and}} {{fissures}} are ideal places for caries development. Placement of dental sealants {{has been reported}} to be effective in preventing this process. However, the effectiveness of dental sealants {{has been reported to}} be influenced by clinical factors, such as preparation and placement techniques. A report recently published by the American Dental Association on the clinical recommendations for use of pit-and-fissure sealants included critical evaluation and a summary of relevant scientific evidence on the use of sealants aimed at assisting clinicians. The report addressed concerns such as: Does placing sealants over early (noncavitated) lesions prevent progression of the lesions? Are there any techniques that could improve sealants’ retention and ffectiveness in caries prevention? The investigators concluded that there is limited and conflicting evidence to support that mechanical preparation with a bur results in higher retention rates in children and recommend that pit-and-fissure sealants should be placed on early (noncavitated) carious lesions. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate two methods of fissure treatment before sealant placement on different caries levels. In this study, 135 extracted human molars (ICDAS codes 0 to 2) were collected and ranked by a calibrated examiner into three groups. These were further divided into three subgroups (nine total). Occlusal surfaces were prepared with: 1) a ¼-mm round bur, 2) air abrasion, and 3) no treatment as a control. All groups were etched with 3. 0 - percent phosphoric acid for 15 seconds, rinsed thoroughly, and dried with an air <b>water</b> <b>syringe.</b> Opaque dental sealants were placed on the etched occlusal surfaces according to the accepted clinical standards and light-cured for 30 seconds. All groups were thermocycled for 5000 cycles. The roots of the teeth were painted with nail varnish, root apices were sealed with wax, and the occlusal surfaces were immersed in 1. 0 -percent methylene blue for a full 24 hours. The next day the teeth were cleaned, and the roots were sectioned to expose the crowns. Crowns were cut along the occlusal surfaces in the buccolingual direction. The sectioned surfaces were examined under the Nikon SMZ 1500 microscope for sealant penetration in the fissure and microleakage along the sealant enamel interface. The analyses were performed on a transformation of the sealant penetration percentage commonly used for calculated percentages: sin- 1 (p 1 / 2). The effects of the type of group, the ICDAS code, and the fissure type on sealant penetration percentage were compared using ANOVA. The effects on microleakage and bubbles were compared using GEE methods applied to logistic regression. The effects on dye penetration were compared using GEE methods applied to cumulative logistic regression to account for the ordered categories of the dye penetration scale. In the findings of sealant penetration, the group type did not {{have a significant effect on}} sealant penetration (p = 0. 195). ICDAS codes had a significant effect on sealant penetration (p = 0. 0113) where ICDAS Code 0 had greater penetration than ICDAS codes 1 and 2. Fissure type had a significant effect on sealant penetration (p = 0. 0001) where fissure types V and U had greater sealant penetration than Fissure types Y and W. In the findings of microleakage, the type of group had a significant effect on microleakage (p = 0. 0004) where the abrasion group had increased microleakage as compared with the 1 / 4 round bur and control groups. ICDAS code had a significant effect on microleakage (p = 0. 0022) where ICDAS code 0 had less microleakage as compared with ICDAS code 1 and 2.

40|$|Purpose: To {{confront the}} {{statement}} that gadolinium contrast media (Gd-CM) are less nephrotoxic than iodine contrast media (I-CM) when used in x-ray angiographic and computed tomographic (CT) examinations. Methods: I) For CT measurements (mean density in Hounsfield numbers) 20 -mL syringes filled with I- and Gd-CM at 0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 05 and 0. 1 mmol attenuating atoms/mL were scanned in air and in a 30 cm polystyrene phantom. For measurements on radiofluoroscopy (RF), X-ray angiography (XA) and direct digital systems (DX) systems (relative contrast values) 20 -mL syringes were filled with 0. 5 M Gd-CM and I-CM at 35, 50, 70, 90, 110 and 140 mg I/mL. The syringes were placed in phantoms equivalent to 13 (thin) and 20 cm (thick) <b>water.</b> <b>Syringes</b> filled with distilled water served as a constancy reference. II) In a non-crossover design in three separate studies 3 ml of each test solution were injected in 8 pigs/study {{at a rate of}} 20 mL/min into the balloon-occluded (10 -minutes) right renal artery of left-sided nephrectomized pigs. Test solutions: 1) 0. 5 M gadopentetate (1. 96 Osm/kg H 2 O), 0. 5 M gadodiamide (0. 78 Osm/kg), 0. 5 M iohexol (190 mg I/mL; 0. 42 Osm/kg), 0. 18 M iohexol (70 mg I/mL; with an x-ray attenuation equal to that of 0. 5 M Gd-CM at 80 kVp) and saline; 2) 0. 5 M gadopentetate, 0. 5 M gadodiamide, 0. 5 M iohexol and mannitol solutions iso-osmotic to these CM; 3) 1. 0 M gadobutrol (1. 6 Osm/kg), 0. 5 M gadodiamide, iodixanol 150 and 320 mg I/mL (290 mOsm/kg) and iopromide 150 mg I/mL (340 mOsm/kg). The plasma half-life elimination time of a GFR-marker were used to compare their effects on glomerular filtration rate 1 - 3 hours post-injection. III) After the experiments the kidneys were evaluated histomorphologically. Results: I) In vitro measurements indicate that 0. 5 M Gd-CM are equal attenuating with 60 - 80 mg I/mL at commonly used 70 - 90 kVp for XRA and with 110 mg I/mL at 120 kVp CT using a body phantom. II) Gadopentetate and iso-osmotic mannitol as well as gadobutrol caused severe impairment of renal function. Gadodiamide caused a 90 % prolongation of plasma half-life relative to saline, significantly longer than 0. 5 M iohexol with a 35 % prolongation. GFR following injections of iohexol 70, iopromide 150, and iodixanol 150 and 320 were in the same range as that following saline. III) Gd-CM with the highest osmolality caused marked necroses and haemorrhage/congestion correlating with their marked impairment of renal function, while the plasma iso-osmotic I-CM caused no or only minimal changes. Conclusions: Gd-CM are more nephrotoxic than equal volumes of I-CM resulting in the same or even better attenuation of x-rays. Thus, Gd-CM should not be used as a substitute for I-CM in patients with renal impairment when performing radiographic examinations.

Recovery of genotype- 2 a reporter HCV from LDS syringe-needle combinations was compared to recovery from insulin syringes with fixed needles and standard HDS syringe-needle combinations. Recovery of HCV from syringes was determined immediately following their contamination with HCV-spiked plasma, after storage at 22 °C for up to 1 week, or after rinsing with <b>water.</b> Insulin <b>syringes</b> with fixed needles had the lowest proportion of HCV-positive syringes before and after storage. HCV recovery after immediate use ranged from 47 %± 4 % HCV-positive 1 mL insulin syringes with 27 -gauge ½ inch needles to 98 %± 1 % HCV-positive HDS 2 mL syringes with 23 -gauge 1 ¼ inch detachable needles. LDS combinations yielded recoveries ranging from 65 %± 5 % to 93 %± 3 %. Recovery was lower in combinations containing LDS needles than LDS syringes. After 3 days of storage, as much as 6 -fold differences in virus recovery was observed, with HCV recovery being lower in combinations containing LDS needles. Most combinations with detachable needles required multiple rinses to reduce HCV infectivity to undetectable levels whereas a single rinse of insulin syringes was sufficient. Our study, the first to assess the infectivity of HCV in residual volumes of LDS syringes and needles available to PWID, demonstrates that LDS syringe-needle combination still has the greater potential for HCV transmission than insulin syringes with fixed needles. Improved LDS designs {{may be able to}} further reduce HCV recovery, but based on the designed tested, LDS needles and syringes remain intermediate between fixed-needle syringes and HDS combinations in reducing exposure to HCV...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMethacrylamide-based {{oligomers}} bearing phosphonate pending {{groups at}} the end of a long alkyl chain and originating from undecylenic acid synthons were subjected to direct oligomer dissolution. Size improvement towards much smaller objects was reached using the nanoprecipitation method: the oligomers were first dissolved in an organic solvent, and then precipitated in <b>water</b> using a <b>syringe</b> pump. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed phosphorous containing monomodal and quite narrow-sized self-assemblies in water with hydrodynamic diameters (DH) ranging from 80 to 280 nm (depending on the oligomer system). Direct visualization using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed filled and almost individual particles with spherical shape. They were considerably shrunk, suggesting the highly swollen character of the self-assemblies in suspension. Morphological information on the multi-scale self-assembled structures was complementarily obtained using static light scattering (SLS). Thus, at a low length-scale, highly segregated sub-units having sharp boundaries surrounded by water (Porod behaviour) were observed, whereas at a high length-scale random non-compact organization of these sub-units via weak interactions was found, forming a chaplet-like structure (Gaussian behaviour). Furthermore, the pH-sensitiveness of the suspensions obtained after the nanoprecipitation method was studied. Particularly, at pH = 12, the characteristic size drastically increased within few hours from typically ~ 280 nm to 2 mm due to electrostatic repulsion between deprotonated hydroxyl groups. At longer times, the observed peculiar behaviour corresponded to the model of diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) where the particles stuck easily together upon contact...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to compare microbial levels of dental units with independent water source (closed-circuit) to dental units {{directly linked to}} municipal water system (open-circuit). Ten dental units with a closed-circuit and ten dental units with open-circuit water systems were randomly selected for this study. Both dental unit types were supplied by municipal water and subjected to the same disinfection protocol. Water samples were collected from the distal outlet of the 3 -in- 1 syringe and from the cup filler. The samples were cultured on yeast extract agar medium for 48 hours at 37 ˚C. The total number of colony forming units (CFU) was counted using a Darkfield Quebec Colony Counter. The results were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with significance level set to p < 0. 05. The mean total viable count (TVC) for the 3 -in- 1 <b>syringe</b> <b>water</b> samples was 619 CFU ml- 1 for closed-circuit water system units and 496 CFU ml- 1 for open-circuit system units {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (p= 0. 565). The mean TVC for the cup filler water samples was 466 CFU ml- 1 for closed-circuit system units, and 336 CFU ml- 1 for open circuit system units, the difference was not statistically significant (p= 0. 534). Over 50 % of all the collected samples contained TVC exceeding the ADA recommended level of < 200 CFU ml- 1. It was concluded that both dental unit types were similar in containing unacceptably high levels of microorganisms. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} assess the {{prevalence}} of Legionella spp. in dental unit waterlines of a dental clinic and to verify whether the microbiological parameters used as indicators of water quality were correlated with Legionella contamination. A risk management plan was subsequently implemented in the dental health care setting, in order to verify whether the adopted disinfection protocols were effective in preventing Legionella colonization. The <b>water</b> delivered from <b>syringes</b> and turbines of 63 dental units operating in a dental clinic, was monitored for counts of the heterotrophic bacteria P. aeruginosa and Legionella spp. (22 °C and 37 °C). At baseline, output water from dental units continuously treated with disinfection products was more compliant with the recommended standards than untreated and periodically treated water. However, continuous disinfection was still not able to prevent contamination by Legionella and P. aeruginosa. Legionella was isolated from 36. 4 %, 24. 3 % and 53. 3 % of samples from untreated, periodically and continuously treated waterlines, respectively. The standard microbiological parameters used as indicators of water quality proved to be unreliable as predictors {{of the presence of}} Legionella, whose source was identified as the tap water used to supply the dental units. The adoption of control measures, including the use of deionized water in supplying the dental unit waterlines and the application of a combined protocol of continuous and periodic disinfection, with different active products for the different devices, resulted in good control of Legionella contamination. The efficacy of the measures adopted was mainly linked to the strict adherence to the planned protocols, which placed particular stress on staff training and ongoing environmental monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Phase {{separation}} {{is one of}} the most significant obstacles encountered during the development of analytical methods for water quality monitoring in spacecraft environments. Removing air bubbles from water samples prior to analysis is a routine task on earth; however, in the absence of gravity, this routine task becomes extremely difficult. This paper details the development and initial ground testing of liquid metering centrifuge sticks (LMCS), devices designed to collect and meter a known volume of bubble-free water in microgravity. The LMCS uses centrifugal force to eliminate entrapped air and reproducibly meter liquid sample volumes for analysis with Colorimetric Solid Phase Extraction (C-SPE). C-SPE is a sorption-spectrophotometric platform that is being developed as a potential spacecraft water quality monitoring system. C-SPE utilizes solid phase extraction membranes impregnated with analyte-specific colorimetric reagents to concentrate and complex target analytes in spacecraft water samples. The mass of analyte extracted from the water sample is determined using diffuse reflectance (DR) data collected from the membrane surface and an analyte-specific calibration curve. The analyte concentration can then be calculated from the mass of extracted analyte and the volume of the sample analyzed. Previous flight experiments conducted in microgravity conditions aboard the NASA KC- 135 aircraft demonstrated that the inability to collect and meter a known volume of <b>water</b> using a <b>syringe</b> was a limiting factor in the accuracy of C-SPE measurements. Herein, results obtained from ground based C-SPE experiments using ionic silver as a test analyte and either the LMCS or syringes for sample metering are compared to evaluate the performance of the LMCS. These results indicate very good agreement between the two sample metering methods and clearly illustrate the potential of utilizing centrifugal forces to achieve phase separation and metering of water samples in microgravity...|$|R
40|$|The PrePex is a WHO [...] prequalified {{medical device}} for adult male {{circumcision}} for HIV prevention. The Government of Rwanda {{was the first}} country to implement the PrePex device and acts as the leading center of excellence providing training and formal guidelines. As part of the Government's efforts to improve PrePex implementation, it made {{efforts to improve the}} psychological acceptability of device by men, thus increasing uptake with VMMC in sub-Saharan Africa. Some men who underwent the PrePex procedure complained of foreskin odor while wearing the PrePex 3 - 7 days after it was placed. This complaint was identified as potential risk for uptake of the device. Researchers from Rwanda assumed there is a possible relation between the level of foreskin odor and patient foreskin hygiene technique. The Government of Rwanda decided to investigate those assumptions in a scientific way and conduct a trial to test different hygiene-cleaning methods in order to increase the acceptability of PrePex and mitigate the odor concern. The main objective of the trial was to compare odor levels between three arms, having identical personal hygiene but different foreskin hygiene techniques using either clear water with soap during a daily shower, soapy <b>water</b> using a <b>syringe,</b> or chlorhexidine using a syringe. One hundred and one subjects were enrolled to the trial and randomly allocated into three trial arms. Using chlorhexidine solution daily almost completely eliminated odor, and was statistically significant more effective that the other two arms. The trial results suggest that odor from the foreskin, while wearing the PrePex device, could be related to the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which can be prevented by a chlorhexidine cleaning method. This finding can be used to increase acceptability by men when considering PrePex as one of the leading methods for HIV prevention in VMMC programs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Needle sharing during {{injection}} {{drug use is}} the most common mode of transmission for the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in the U. S. The scientific literature on the relationship between knowledge and risk behaviors for HCV transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID) is minimal. Evidence-based and harm reduction programs (e. g., needle exchange programs; reducing needle and works sharing) exist to reduce the risks of HCV and other blood-borne pathogens, however these programs are not widely available. Solutions to reduce HCV transmission in the general population involve changes at the individual level {{as well as at the}} policy level. On the U. S. -Mexico border region, where drug trafficking, violence, and other structural factors have led to an increase in local drug consumption, residents are vulnerable for {{injection drug}} use, works and needle sharing, and thus HCV. AIMS: The study aims are to determine the: (1) level of HCV knowledge; (2) prevalence of HCV risk behaviors including needle and works sharing; and (3) association between HCV knowledge measures and HCV risk behaviors among HCV PWID living in Cd. Juárez, CHIH. METHODS: This study is a secondary data analysis from a cross-sectional study conducted in collaboration with Programa Compañeros, A. C. to assess the prevalence of HCV and HIV and risk behaviors among PWID and their non-injecting sex partners. Face to face interviews were conducted between March - May 2012. Measures collected include socio-demographic characteristics, drug use, needle and works sharing, HCV knowledge, and other HCV risk behaviors among 48 PWID who were HCV positive and living in Cd. Juárez. There are five outcome measures for HCV transmission risk behaviors: 1) injecting with others; 2) receptive syringe sharing; 3) receptive works sharing; 4) use of bleach water to clean the syringes; and 5) use of used <b>water</b> to clean <b>syringes.</b> The association between the HCV transmission risk behaviors (binary outcomes) and knowledge of HCV transmission and other measures will be determined using the Pearson Chi-Square Tests for categorical variables, t-tests for continuous variables, and non-parametric equivalent tests as needed. RESULTS: Overall, this was a sample of 48 PWID who were HCV reactive were primarily males (68. 8...|$|R
