60|$|There is, {{almost all}} the Spring and Summer time, a certain small, round, white Cobweb, as 'twere, about the bigness of a Pea, which sticks very close and fast to the stocks of Vines nayl'd against a warm wall: being attentively viewed, they seem cover'd, upon the upper side of them, with a small husk, not unlike the scale, or shell of a Wood-louse, or Hog-louse, a small Insect usually found about rotten wood, which upon {{touching}} presently rouls it self into {{the form of a}} peppercorn: Separating several of these from the stock, I found them, with my Microscope, to consist of a shell, which now seemed more likely to be the husk of one of these Insects: And the fur seem'd a kind of cobweb, consisting of abundance of small filaments, or sleaves of cobwebs. In the midst of this, if they were not hatch'd, and run away before, the time of which hatching was usually about the latter end of June, or beginning of July, I have often found abundance of small brown Eggs, such as A and B in the second Figure of the 36. Scheme, much about the bigness of Mites Eggs; and at other times, multitudes of small Insects, shaped exactly like that in the third Figure marked with X. Its head large, almost half the bigness of its body, which is usual in the foetus of most Creatures. It had two small black eyes aa, and two small long joynted and brisled horns bb. The hinder part of its body seem'd to consist of nine scales, and the last ended in a forked tayl, much like that of a Cutio, or <b>Wood</b> <b>louse,</b> out of which grew two long hairs; they ran to and fro very swiftly, and were much of the bigness of a common Mite, but some of them less: The longest of them seem'd not the hundredth part of an inch, and the Eggs usually not above half as much. They seemed to have six legs, which were not visible in this I have here delineated, by reason they were drawn under its body.|$|E
40|$|Two maternally {{inherited}} {{sex ratio}} distorters (SRD) impose female-biased sex ratios on the <b>wood</b> <b>louse</b> Armadillidium vulgare by feminizing putative males. These SRD are (i) an intracytoplasmic bacterium {{of the genus}} Wolbachia, and (ii) another non-Mendelian element of unknown nature: the f element. Mitochondrial DNA variation was investigated in A. vulgare field populations to trace the evolution of host-SRD relationships and to investigate the effect of SRD on host cytoplasmic polymorphism. The Wolbachia endosymbionts showed no polymorphism in their ITS 2 sequence and were associated with two closely related mitochondrial types. This situation probably reflects a single infection event followed by a slight differentiation of mitochondria. There was no association between the f element and a given mitochondrial type, which may confirm {{the fact that this}} element can be partially paternally transmitted. The spreading of a maternally inherited SRD in a population should reduce the mitochondrial diversity by a hitchhiking process. In A. vulgare, however, a within-population mtDNA polymorphism was often found, because of the deficient spread of Wolbachia and the partial paternal inheritance of the f element. The analysis of molecular variance indicated that A. vulgare populations are genetically structured, but without isolation by distance...|$|E

40|$|Careful {{investigation}} {{has shown that}} when garbage is divided into different categories such as plastic, paper, metals, etc., food waste accounts for about 8 % of the refuse. This food waste is all decomposable and rather than send it away to dumps, can be put to valuable use as organic compost for yards and gardens. The idea below shows how the KITCHEN KOMPOSTER, which is made almost entirely of recycled materials, will produce a fine, clean, non-toxic compost. The entire process is natural and uses bacteria, millipedes, worms, <b>wood</b> <b>lice</b> and other invertebrates {{to break down the}} refuse thrown into the bin. How to use the KITCHEN KOMPOSTER: 1. Place the KOMPOSTER on a flat smooth surface such as concrete or a metal sheet. Be sure the bin is level. 2. Put large breadfruit leaves or other large leaves {{in the bottom of the}} bin to cover the holes. 3. Add millipedes, worms and <b>wood</b> <b>lice</b> from a sack of prestarted compost. Spread the mixture evenly on the leaves making sure the insects have an adequate depth of 'soil` to burrow into. 4. Add kitchen refuse into the bin whenever you need to dispose of scraps. Anything that is organic will decompose in the KOMPOSTER. 5. From time to time, add some garden refuse to the bin to help balance the moisture content in the bin. Be careful not to overheat the KOMPOSTER by adding a large amount of very fresh grass clippings. They will generate a high degree of heat if too much is added at the same time. 6. If you find any millipedes worms or <b>wood</b> <b>lice</b> while working in your garden or yard, add these to the KOMPOSTER, they will help speed up the composting process.

25|$|O. bauri usually spends {{its time}} below the leaf litter, {{classifying}} it as a leaf-litter ant. It is also widely {{known as a}} generalist predator. A few of O. bauri’s common prey include worms, spiders, termites, ants, butterflies, flies, and beetles. Usually prey would be around 3 mm and 4 mm in length. The most common prey O. bauri enjoys are soft bodied, for example, termites and <b>wood</b> <b>lice.</b> O. bauri is able to “exploit a food resource largely unavailable to other ants”. This was determined after a researcher found remnants of Nasuitermes a type of termite that as a defense will discharge material that irritates and can block the predator’s sensory organs. Finding parts {{of this type of}} termite prove that the mandibles of O. bauri are able to combat prey which is chemically protected.|$|R
40|$|In 1997 – 2003 we {{discovered}} {{and described the}} transmission of microarthropods, including oribatid mites (Acariformes, Oribatei), springtails (Collem-bola), small spiders, beetles, insect larvae, pseudoscor-pions, millipedes, and <b>wood</b> <b>lice</b> 0. 1 – 1. 5 mm in size by birds in their feathering. This phenomenon suggests a considerable role of birds {{in the distribution of}} these arthropods [1 – 3]. Birds are probably the most impor-tant factor determining the distribution of microarthro-pods on Arctic islands; we found in bird feathering 44 species of oribatid mites, the microarthropod group with the largest species diversity, out of the 74 species that have ever been found in soils of Arctic islands from the Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya to Wrangel Island [3]. It was interesting to determine whether birds could have brought these animals to the Antarctic continent, where soil microarthropods are relatively numerous and diverse in the soils of Subantarctic islands and “oases ” on the continent itself [4]. In this work, we studied soil microarthropods in the feathering of Antarctic birds, including those that do not come in contact with soil even during the reproduc-tive period...|$|R
40|$|Arthropods play {{a crucial}} role in the {{decomposition}} of organic matter. Soil macrofauna, such as <b>wood</b> <b>lice,</b> earth worms and millipedes, represent the first step in the process of litter decomposition on forest floors. They reduce large particles to smaller sizes and are therefore functionally important regarding nutrient cycling. In this study we focus on the distribution of woodlice and millipedes in the forest interior and edges of small forest fragments in agricultural landscapes. Arthropods were sampled using pitfalls in 224 deciduous forest fragments in 7 regions across Europe from south France to central Sweden. Woodlice and millipedes show different patterns and respond in a different way to forest edges. Woodlice were far more abundant in forest edges compared to interiors. This pattern was less clear for millipedes. Also the intensification of the surrounding landscape influences the species composition and numbers, with more individuals in more intensively used landscapes. These relatively immobile species groups show to be strong indicators for the age but less for the size of forest fragments. The differences in species composition and numbers of these important detritivores among forest patches and landscapes is discussed with respect to litter decomposition...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of soil bacteria and fungi to the digestive fluid of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa was studied. The fluid {{was obtained by}} centrifugation of the native enzymes of the digestive tract. The inhibition of growth of certain bacteria, spores, and fungal hyphae under the effect of extracts from the anterior and middle sections of the digestive tract of A. caliginosa was discovered for the first time. In bacteria, microcolony formation was inhibited as early as 20 - 30 s after {{the application of the}} gut extracts, which may indicate the nonenzymatic nature of the effect. The digestive fluid exhibited the same microbicidal activity whether the earthworms were feeding on soil or sterile sand. This indicates that the microbicidal agents are formed within the earthworm's body, rather than by soil microorganisms. The effect of the digestive fluid from the anterior and middle divisions is selective in relation to different microorganisms. Of 42 strains of soil bacteria, seven were susceptible to the microbicidal action of the fluid (Alcaligenes. faecalis 345 - 1, Microbacterium sp. 423 - 1, Arthrobacter sp. 430 - 1, Bacillus megaterium 401 - 1, B. megaterium 413 - 1, Kluyvera ascorbata 301 - 1, Pseudomonas reactans 387 - 2). The remaining bacteria did not die in the digestive fluid. Of 13 micromycetes, the digestive fluid inhibited spore germination in Aspergillus terreus and Paecilomyces lilacinus and the growth of hyphae in Trichoderma harzianum and Penicillium decumbens. The digestive fluid stimulated spore germination in Alternaria alternata and the growth of hyphae in Penicillium chrysogenum. The {{reaction of}} the remaining micromycetes was neutral. The gut fluid from the posterior division of the abdominal tract did not possess microbicidal activity. No relation was found between the reaction of microorganisms to the effects of the digestive fluid and the taxonomic position of the microorganisms. The effects revealed are similar to those shown earlier for millipedes and <b>wood</b> <b>lice</b> in the following parameters: quick action of the digestive fluid on microorganisms, and the selectivity of the action on microorganisms revealed at the strain level. The selective effect of the digestive gut fluid of the earthworms on soil microorganisms is important for animal feeding, maintaining the homeostasis of the gut microbial community, and the formation of microbial communities in soils...|$|R
