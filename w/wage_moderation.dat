40|$|Until the mid- 1990 s Belgium and the Netherlands {{remained}} largely aligned {{in terms of}} output growth. However, since then they have shown a more divergent growth pattern as the Netherlands experienced a much more pronounced cycle than Belgium. There are three main explanations. (1) The Netherlands saw significant equity withdrawals from rising housing prices that only lessened as the real-estate market cooled down {{at the start of}} the new millennium, while the dynamic in the Belgian housing market has been much more modest and home equity withdrawal insignificant. (2) The inflation pressures and labour market tensions that built up during the late 1990 s in the Netherlands resulted in high nominal labour cost growth, a substantial loss in international competitiveness and the need for severe <b>wage</b> <b>moderations</b> in the ensuing years, which in turn reinforced the downward part of the cycle.

40|$|The {{consensus}} of empirical {{evidence on the}} wage and price relationship reveals that causal relationships are difficult to identify. Moreover, elements other than wages, prices and productivity have significant impact in determining the wage-price setting equilibrium. Application of VECM analysis in the wage-price relationship for EU 28 and EMU over the period 2000 :Q 1 – 2014 :Q 4 implies that there is statistically robust evidence of long-run cointegration relationship between wages and prices. Additionally, the estimated values of cointegration coefficients provide strong evidence in favor of hypothesis that assumption of near-rational behavior in the wage-price relationship is valid in case of EU 28, whereas that of rational expectations is valid in case of EMU. Specifically, {{the evidence suggests that}} wage setters have under-adjusted for inflation as probably in their view the costs of such behavior were low. This can serve as an argument that wage and price setters have unconditionally accepted the strict rigor of monetary policy authorities. Such behavior can also be attributed to labor market flexibility which is a central element in determining the overall economic performance. In principle, <b>wage</b> <b>moderations</b> induced by a flexible labor market should improve and/or restore the international competitiveness and result in more output and employment in EU 28 and EMU...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the overall macroeconomic impact arising from reform in government wages and employment, {{at times of}} fiscal consolidation. Reform of these two components of the government wage bill appeared necessary for containing {{the deterioration of the}} public finances in several EU countries, {{as a consequence of the}} financial crisis. Such reforms entailed in some instances, but not always, the implementation of cost-cutting measures affecting the government wage bill, as part of broader consolidation packages that typically hinged more heavily on other fiscal instruments, like public investment. While such measures have adverse short-term macroeconomic effects, public wage bill restraining policy changes present the idiosyncrasy that they can yield medium- to longer-term benefits due to possible competitiveness and efficiency gains through their impact on labour market dynamics. This paper provides some evidence of such medium- to long-run effects, based on a wealth of micro and macro data in the euro area and the EU. It concludes that appropriately designed government <b>wage</b> bill <b>moderation</b> could indeed produce positive dividends to the economy, which depend on certain country-specific conditions. These gains can be reinforced by relevant fiscal-structural reforms...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} 25 years, Denmark {{is one of}} the European economies where the {{unemployment}} rate has changed the most dramatically. Previously, from 1979 on and up to 1994 it rose far above the EU-average. In 1993 a centre-left government took office, and a major change in economic policies was undertaken both with regard to demand management and labour market reforms. From 1994 to 2002, the official rate of unemployment was reduced from 12 ½ percent to 5 percent. This paper challenges the conventional wisdom put forward by a number of Danish and international observers that the major explanatory factor for this Danish “unemployment miracle” can be solely explained by the 1994 / 1996 labour market reforms reinforcing the existing Danish flexicurity system. To put the analysis into a proper perspective we have chosen to look at the development in employment in a somewhat longer period, because the ‘flexicurity system’ is well established, and {{has been a part of}} the Danish Model, since the 1960 s. Anyhow, it went through a number of changes in the 1980 s and 1990 s which might have improved the labour market performance. Hence, our task with this paper is to investigate to what extent jobs were created by demand management policies or by improved international competitiveness caused by improved labour market adjustment and <b>wage</b> cost <b>moderation.</b> The arguments are supported by a theoretical framework as well as by empirical findings concerning the Danish economy...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{previous}} forecasts, {{there have been}} increasing signs of recovery, {{in the wake of}} the most severe recession suffered by the global economy in the last sixty years. Indicators show that confidence has returned since the spring, against a backdrop of easing financial tension, while industrial production and trade have both increased slightly worldwide. Doubts still remain, however, as to the sustainability of the recovery. This recovery has, in fact, largely been driven by budgetary and monetary policy stimulus, along with movements in inventories, the effects of which are temporary. In contrast, unemployment is likely to increase further in most of the advanced economies, with investment remaining low, and this will restrict growth in 2010. In Belgium, the sheer scale of the GDP decline at the end of 2008 and the start of 2009 was historic. However, GDP did rise by 0. 5 p. c. in the third quarter, and a revival in business cycle indicators suggests that the economy should continue to grow. The growth rate will remain low, however, given the absence of any vigorous recovery in foreign demand and the anticipated weakness of investment and private consumption, against the backdrop of a deteriorating labour market. GDP is thus set to contract by 3. 1 p. c. on average in 2009, before growing by 1 p. c. in 2010. The labour market initially showed a certain degree of resilience in the face of the severe contraction in activity. Job losses and increasing unemployment were contained by the massive use of temporary lay-offs and other methods of reducing working hours. They were also cushioned by a significant drop in company productivity. Employment is likely to fall by 118, 000 units between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010. As an annual average, net job losses are forecast at 27, 000 and 64, 000 persons respectively in 2009 and 2010. The unemployment rate is set to rise from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 9 p. c. in 2010. The deterioration in labour market conditions is expected to result in <b>wage</b> growth <b>moderation.</b> The combination of a severe financial crisis and a generalised decline in economic activity significantly affected both consumers and businesses in 2009. With the exception of public sector consumption and investment, all the main expenditure categories affected GDP negatively. Businesses had to face the synchronised collapse of most foreign markets, with exports contracting by more than 12 p. c. In addition, inventories were reduced significantly. Finally, businesses are likely to cut their investments, due to the unprecedented decline in their capacity utilisation rate in particular, along with modest demand prospects. Consumers are also likely to reign in their expenditure significantly in 2009, both in terms of consumption and investment in housing. This behaviour is largely an expression of great restraint in the face of uncertain prospects for jobs or future incomes. In 2010, the modest recovery in growth is likely to be based on a slight increase in private consumption and exports, and on a turnaround in inventory movements. Private investment adjustment is, however, likely to continue. As in the euro area, inflation in Belgium eased rapidly over the course of 2009, even turning negative from May to November, as a consequence of the significant fall in energy prices in comparison with {{the previous}} year. Due to the recent increase in international oil quotations, inflation is expected to return to positive figures at the end of 2009, though remaining low, owing to the rapid attenuation of pressure from import prices and wages. In all, as an annual average, inflation is expected to be 0 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 6 p. c. in 2010. In the macroeconomic context depicted above, and in the light of the measures approved by the authorities, e. g. in the budgetary context, the public deficit is expected to reach 6. 1 p. c. of GDP in 2009 and 5. 4 p. c. in 2010, if there is no change in policy. In 2009 and 2010, the general government debt is expected to record a further sharp rise, though the increase should be slightly lower than the average for the euro area, rising from 89. 8 p. c. of GDP in 2008 to 98. 1 p. c. in 2009 and 102 p. c. in 2010.

40|$|Since the {{previous}} forecasts {{were published in}} February 2009, the downturn in activity and international trade in late 2008 and early 2009 {{has proved to be}} even sharper than initially expected. An unprecedentedly deep recession has spread across the various economic regions of the world, requiring resolute action in the monetary and fiscal sphere. There are signs which suggest some stabilisation of both financial market conditions and business and consumer confidence. Nonetheless, the adjustments to be made to employment, investment and the position of financial institutions are likely to hamper the economic recovery. The sharp cyclical downturn in the euro area at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 had a major impact on economic activity in Belgium. In particular, both industrial production and foreign trade in goods plummeted from October 2008. According to the national accounts data, real GDP was down by 1. 7 p. c. {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, falling by a further 1. 6 p. c. in the first quarter of 2009, the deepest recession since the Second World War. The decline in activity should decelerate sharply from the second quarter of 2009, and give way to a modest recovery in 2010. Thus, having grown by 1 p. c. in 2008, GDP is set to contract by 3. 5 p. c. on average in 2009 and by 0. 2 p. c. in 2010. In the face of the abrupt contraction in activity, firms reacted for example by reducing agency work and greatly increasing their use of temporary lay-offs. Such systems offer a provisional buffer against the effect on employment of fluctuations in production. However, taking account of the deep and sustained decline in activity, the number of persons employed is likely to decline progressively. As an annual average, net job losses are forecast at 36, 000 and 80, 000 persons respectively in 2009 and 2010. The unemployment rate is set to rise from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 9. 2 p. c. in 2010, reaching 9. 7 p. c. by the end of 2010. In 2009, all the main expenditure categories – domestic demand, change in stocks and net exports – are set to be seriously affected, directly or indirectly, by the recession in global demand and the repercussions of the global financial crisis; in 2010, their contribution to the change in GDP is forecast to be broadly neutral. Exports of goods and services are projected to record a very marked fall in 2009, following the collapse of foreign demand. They are likely to continue falling slightly in 2010. In the absence of support from domestic demand, the profile of imports is expected to mirror that of exports. Following the curb on growth in 2008 resulting from the stagnation of real disposable income in a context of rising inflation, private consumption is set to fall in 2009, mainly owing to the plunge in share prices and the deterioration in economic conditions and the labour market outlook, both these factors contributing to an increase in the savings rate. In the context of the decline in their capacity utilisation rate, gloomy forecasts for demand, the high cost of external financing and the reduction in the financial resources generated by their own activity, businesses are likely to cut their investment in 2009 and 2010, following more than four years of sustained vigour. Investment in housing is also set to fall in 2009 and 2010, continuing the slowdown which began in 2007. Having peaked at 5. 9 p. c. in July 2008, inflation in Belgium eased rapidly and should continue to fall in the short term, becoming negative for a time. This situation, likely to last only a few months, is due mainly to base effects connected with the record prices of petroleum products during the summer of 2008. Once these base effects have faded away, inflation is expected to return to positive figures at the end of 2009, though remaining low up to the end of the projection period, owing to the rapid attenuation of pressure from import prices and wages. In all, as an annual average, inflation is expected to reach 0. 1 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 3 p. c. in 2010, having stood at 4. 5 p. c. in 2008. The health index is projected to rise by 0. 8 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 1 p. c. in 2010. Reflecting both the fall in labour productivity, following the cyclical weakness, and the still sustained rise in hourly labour costs, unit labour costs in the private sector rose by 3. 9 p. c. in 2008 and are likely to rise by a further 2. 9 p. c. in 2009, as a result of high indexation which follows from the surge in inflation in 2008. In 2010, they should remain more or less steady. This deceleration between 2009 and 2010 is due partly to the cyclical recovery in labour productivity. Also, the growth of hourly labour costs is set to fall from 3. 5 p. c. in 2008 to 2. 3 p. c. in 2009 and 0. 4 p. c. in 2010. The deterioration in labour market conditions is expected to result in <b>wage</b> growth <b>moderation.</b> According to the provisional figures published by the NAI in March 2009, Belgium’s public finances recorded a deficit of 1. 2 p. c. of GDP in 2008. In the macroeconomic context depicted above and in the light of the measures approved by the federal government and the regional governments, e. g. in connection with the recovery plans, that deficit is expected to reach 5. 5 p. c. of GDP in 2009 and 6 p. c. in 2010, if policy remains unchanged. After having declined continuously since 1993, to reach 84 p. c. in 2007, the ratio of public debt to GDP began rising again in 2008, mainly as a result of the capital injections and loans granted to financial institutions. In 2009 and 2010, the general government debt is expected to record a further sharp rise to 97. 4 and 103 p. c. of GDP respectively. Belgium, macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem...|$|R

Since such wages are independent of the workers' domestic outside opportunities, <b>wage</b> <b>moderation</b> - induced by deeper economic integration - creates leeway {{for the government to}} engage in redistributive policies even if this improves the workers' domestic outside options. Only if the latter become sufficiently attractive will redistribution induce some offshoring, and it is only at that level that further economic integration will lead to both <b>wage</b> <b>moderation</b> and offshoring activities. Therefore, our analysis suggests that rather than provoking a downsizing of the welfare state, offshoring defines an upper limit for the generosity of the welfare state below which redistribution becomes less instead of more distortive.

40|$|In this paper, {{the rising}} {{divergence}} in sectoral <b>wage</b> <b>moderation</b> within European Monetary Union (EMU) member states since {{the introduction of}} the Euro is examined. During the 1980 s and 1990 s, wage restraint cycles between exposed, manufacturing sectors, and sheltered, private services sectors within EMU candidate-countries were highly synchronous, and differences in wage inflation between sectors within countries was low. After 1996, significant divergence in sectoral wage inflation emerged, and synchronicity of wage restraint cycles between sectors collapsed after 1999. This paper will address the question of why divergence occurred between sectoral wage restraint within EMU countries after 1996. It will be argued that monetary union’s removal of national exchange rate pegs and inflation criteria, and the central banks that enforced them, accentuated wage preference divergence between actors in the exposed and sheltered sectors, enabling unions in sheltered sectors to push for high wage increases while unions in more exposed sectors had to continue with <b>wage</b> <b>moderation</b> due to competitiveness constraints. Unlike some political science literature that assumes powerful, protected sectors produce excessive wage inflation {{at the expense of the}} exposed sector, it will be argued that the European Monetary System’s fixed exchange rate arrangements, and more importantly the Maastricht inflation criteria, provided an effective monetary constraint on sheltered sector wage growth, keeping sheltered sector <b>wage</b> <b>moderation</b> in line with wage restraint developments in the exposed sector in the 1980 s and early 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a firm's profits under Cournot {{oligopoly}} can be increasing {{in the number of}} firms in the industry if wages are determined by (decentralised) bargaining in unionized bilateral oligopoly. The intuition for the result is that increased product market competition following {{an increase in the number}} of firms is mirrored by increased labor market rivalry which induces (profit-enhancing) <b>wage</b> <b>moderation.</b> Whether the product or labor market effect dominates depends both on the extent of union bargaining power and on the nature of union preferences. A corollary of the results derived is that if the upstream agents are firms rather than labor unions, then profits are always decreasing in the number of firms, as in the standard Cournot model. We also show that if bargaining is centralized then there is no <b>wage</b> <b>moderation</b> effect and wages are the same independent of the number of firms, as in the standard model with exogenous factor costs...|$|E
40|$|In the Dutch {{economic}} policy debate, <b>wage</b> <b>moderation</b> {{is widely considered}} as a key factor for achieving economic growth and low unemployment. However, some economists criticise the policy emphasis on <b>wage</b> <b>moderation,</b> claiming that high wages are needed to maintain structural labour productivity growth. This paper analyses {{the effects of a}} wage push on labour productivity within the framework of endogenous technological progress, endogenous technology adoption and insufficient competition. The conclusion is that a wage push raises labour productivity in the short run. However, this rise in labour productivity is temporary and inefficient. In the long run, a wage push may well harm labour productivity. The main message of the paper is that it is probably best not to use wage policy at all as a tool to influence productivity. As a tool against unemployment, however, it is very effective. These insights are applied in a review of the Dutch post-war productivity growth. ...|$|E
