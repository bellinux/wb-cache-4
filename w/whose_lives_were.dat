5|$|Well-to-do men {{wore the}} Petha or Kulavi, a tall turban made of silk and {{decorated}} with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used {{by men and women}} and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water, civet musk, musk or sandalwood. In stark contrast to the commoners <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> modest, the lives of the empire's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery, their daily duties being light.|$|E
25|$|Social and {{political}} strife {{have played a}} key role in the development of new sorts of kami, specifically the goryo-shin (the sacred spirit kami). The goryo are the vengeful spirits of the dead <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> cut short, but they were calmed by the devotion of Shinto followers and are now believed to punish those who do not honor the kami.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{deficiency}} and toxicity can {{be either}} of genetic or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's genetic diseases, which {{are the focus of}} intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential micronutrient. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the victims}} found {{alongside}} the highway, 16-year-old Ramona Wilson, was a subject of a 2006 documentary film by Métis filmmaker Christine Welsh, entitled Finding Dawn. Welsh's documentary highlights the tragic reality that Aboriginal women face today; in the past 30 years, an estimated 500 Aboriginal women have gone missing or have been murdered in Canada. Welsh uncovers the social, economic and historical {{factors that contribute to}} this grim statistic. Finding Dawn honours the women <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> lost and instills hope within a deeply wounded culture. The film can be accessed online on the Nation Film Board web page.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} {{to the victims of}} the attack was dedicated at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia on 12 October 2001. It was erected along the shore of Willoughby Bay, and overlooks the channel used by Navy ships transiting to sea. Seventeen low-level markers stand for the youthfulness of the sailors, <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> cut short. Three tall granite monoliths, each bearing brass plaques, stand for the three colors of the American flag. A set of brown markers encircling the memorial symbolize the darkness and despair that overcame the ship. In addition, 28 black pine trees were planted to represent the 17 sailors and the 11 children they left behind.|$|E
25|$|The Mae West was {{a common}} {{nickname}} for the first inflatable life preserver, which was invented in 1928 by Peter Markus (1885–1974) (US Patent 1694714), with his subsequent improvements in 1930 and 1931. The nickname originated because someone wearing the inflated life preserver often appeared to be as large-breasted as the actress Mae West. It was popular during the Second World War with U.S. Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force servicemen, who were issued inflatable Mae Wests {{as part of their}} flight gear. Air crew members <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> saved by use of the Mae West (and other personal flotation devices) were eligible for membership in the Goldfish Club.|$|E

25|$|The first {{large-scale}} exoduses {{took place}} in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily from Iraq, Yemen and Libya. In these cases over 90% of the Jewish population left, despite the necessity of leaving their property behind. Two hundred and sixty thousand Jews from Arab countries immigrated to Israel between 1948 and 1951, accounting for 56% of the total immigration to the newly founded state. Following the establishment of the State of Israel, a plan to accommodate 600,000 immigrants over four years, doubling the existing Jewish population, was submitted by the Israeli government to the Knesset. The plan, however, encountered mixed reactions; there were those within the Jewish Agency and government who opposed promoting a large-scale emigration movement among Jews <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> not in danger.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish Agency {{has played}} an {{important}} role in supporting the residents of Sderot and the surrounding area, which has been the target of many rockets launched from Gaza. More than 12,000 children have enjoyed respite activities in the center and north of the country (during Operation Protective Edge); 300 educators have been trained to work with children living through trauma (during Operation Cast Lead); supplemental educational activities have been offered to more than 2,000 students; the S.O.S. Emergency Fund for Victims of Terror has helped more than 200 people <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> directly affected by the Kassam attacks; 100 bomb shelters were renovated in the region during Cast Lead and 500 during Operation Protective Edge; and 500 students received scholarships (during Cast Lead) to study at Sapir College in Sderot, with more scheduled to receive scholarships as of the aftermath of Operation Protective Edge.|$|E
25|$|As {{the genre}} of {{expressionism}} began to diminish, {{the genre of}} the New Objectivity (die neue Sachlichkeit) began to take its place. It was influenced by new issues which occupied the public in those years, as the rampant inflation caused deterioration in the economic status of the middle class. These films, often called “street films” or “asphalt films”, tried to reflect reality in all its complexity and ugliness. They focused on objects surrounding the characters and cynically symbolized the despair felt by the German people, <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> shattered after the war. The most prominent film maker who is associated with this genre is Georg Wilhelm Pabst in his films such as: Joyless Street (1925), Pandora's Box (1929), and The Loves of Jeanne Ney (1927). Pabst is also credited with innovations in film editing, such as reversing {{the angle of the}} camera or cutting between two camera angles, which enhanced film continuity and later became standards of the industry.|$|E

During the event, she said: [...] "It has been both unfortunate and unfair for HIV infection {{to be considered a}} shameful disease, for people living with HIV to be judged as blameworthy, and for AIDS to be equated with certain death.

500|$|Before {{the end of}} the war the {{international}} community had begun to provide aid in large quantities to the refugees living in India. Although humanitarian aid was given, there was little support for the war crimes trials which Bangladesh proposed at {{the end of the}} war. Critics of the United Nations have used the atrocities of 1971 to argue that military intervention was the only thing to stop the mass murder. Writing to The New York Times, a group of women said in response to women being shunned by family and husbands, [...] "It is unthinkable that innocent wives <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> virtually destroyed by war are now being totally destroyed by their own husbands". International aid was also forthcoming owing to the issue of war rape.|$|E

500|$|In August, {{journalist}} Al Aronowitz {{arranged for}} the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were [...] "perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds": Dylan's audience of [...] "college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style" [...] contrasted with their fans, [...] "veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>were</b> totally {{wrapped up in the}} commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. They were seen as idolaters, not idealists." [...] Within six months of the meeting, Gould writes, [...] "Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona". Within a year, [...] "the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [...] audience... showing signs of growing up." ...|$|E
