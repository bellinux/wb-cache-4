25|$|A related {{speculation}} by Sagan and Newman {{suggests that}} if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is {{a tiny fraction of}} the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> of this transition is considered low in the paradox.|$|E

2500|$|Returning to the Tribune in 1849, Dana {{became a}} {{proprietor}} and its managing editor, {{and in this}} capacity actively promoted the anti-slavery cause, seeming to shape the paper's policy {{at a time when}} Horace Greeley was undecided and vacillating. However, his writing expressed racist feelings towards blacks on at least one occasion. In 1895, as editor of the New York Sun, he wrote [...] "we {{are in the midst of}} a growing menace," [...] the year of eventual black heavy weight champion Jack Johnson's first professional fight. [...] "The black man is rapidly forging to the front ranks in athletics, especially in the field of fisticuffs. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> of a black rise against white supremacy." [...] The extraordinary influence and circulation attained by the newspaper during the ten years preceding the Civil War was in a degree due to the development of Dana's genius for journalism, reflected not only in the making of the Tribune as a newspaper, but also in the management of its staff of writers, and in the steadiness of its policy as the leading organ of anti-slavery sentiment.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, Attlee {{opposed the}} Munich Agreement, in which Chamberlain {{negotiated}} with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland: We all feel relief that war {{has not come}} this time. Every {{one of us has}} been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There {{can be no doubt that}} it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.|$|E

60|$|In {{this state}} of affairs the Genius of Discord himself could {{scarcely}} have invented a way of again setting us by the ears but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past. The counsels of that Genius seem to have prevailed.

Who is responsible for this? Is it those who resist the measure, or those who causelessly brought it forward, and pressed it through, having reason to know, and in fact knowing, it must and would be so resisted? It could not but be expected by its author that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery, aggravated by a gross breach of faith.|$|E
