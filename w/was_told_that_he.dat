One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, {{only a few miles}} from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{made this}} {{announcement}} on a Saturday when most Football League clubs, including Oxford and Reading, were playing League fixtures. Oxford were playing away at Doncaster Rovers. Jim Smith {{learned of the}} announcement shortly before kick-off at Doncaster's Belle Vue ground from John Ley, a journalist with the Oxford Mail, who had heard the news from another newsman by telephone.

He had also sent an application to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a government agency whose Langley Research Center was located in Hampton, Virginia; Kraft considered it to be too close to home, but applied as insurance. On arrival at Chance Vought he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not be inducted without his birth certificate, which he had not brought with him. Annoyed by the bureaucratic mindset of the company, he decided to accept the offer from NACA instead.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{was taken}} to several {{internment}} centres for Nazi officials and interrogated. In September1945, he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be tried for war crimes, and several days later, he {{was taken to}} Nuremberg and incarcerated there. Speer was indicted on all four possible counts: first, participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace; second, planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace; third, war crimes; and lastly, crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E

5|$|He {{was linked}} with {{a move to}} League One club Crewe Alexandra in February 2008, having been unable to figure in Mixu Paatelainen's plans at Hibs, meaning he was frozen {{out of the first}} team. Donaldson {{finished}} 2007–08 with 21 appearances and 6 goals, his last goal of the season coming against Falkirk in December 2007. In the summer of 2008, he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was available for transfer by Hibs. Crewe were believed to be lining up a bid for him in July 2008, who had money available after selling striker Nicky Maynard to Bristol City for £2.25million and held negotiations with Donaldson. The move stalled after a six-figure fee had been agreed but Donaldson later agreed personal terms.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|Meredith {{signed for}} League Two team Shrewsbury Town on 14 January 2008 on a one-and-a-half-year {{contract}} after training with the club, {{which included a}} clause that after making five appearances the contract could be renegotiated.

Parsons, and Norman F. Ramsey Jr., who briefed him on the project. Tibbets <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would {{be in charge of the}} 509th Composite Group, a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of military stores. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: Great Bend Army Airfield, Kansas; Mountain Home Army Airfield, Idaho; or Wendover Army Air Field, Utah. Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{days after}} the Double Tenth, Bishop John Wilson of St Andrew's Cathedral {{was taken to the}} YMCA, and placed in the cell next to Elizabeth. He was {{severely}} beaten for three days before the Japanese accepted that he was not one of the ringleaders in their imagined conspiracy. One night Elizabeth saw Rob Scott, by then badly disfigured {{as a result of the}} beatings and water tortures that he had been subjected to. At the end of one session Scott <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been sentenced to death, and was forced to write a farewell letter to his wife. He was later sentenced to six years' imprisonment in Outram Road Prison instead, the site where convicted sepoy mutineers had been detained and executed by the British Army in 1915.|$|E
5|$|The first {{selection}} round, {{consisted of}} a selection based on science qualifications {{in the field in}} question, which Van den Berg easily passed. The final four candidates were tested on physical and mental qualifications which he also passed, while two of the others failed due to possible heart issues. He was now part of the final two, and NASA always trains two astronauts, a prime and a back-up. In 1983 he started to train as an astronaut and six months before the launch he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be the prime astronaut, much to his own surprise.

However, when she tried to contact Chen, she <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had already married {{and did not want to}} meet her.

5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E

5|$|When the {{campaign}} {{came to an}} end, the battalion returned to Salisbury. Guest then travelled to England and sought a commission, joining the South Lancashire Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant in September 1916. He was later promoted to Captain. He went with his battalion to France where they were posted to the 59th Division, then in the line. The sector they occupied was not very active, but shelling and sniping from both sides were carried out fairly regularly. It {{was not long before}} Guest was wounded, and then he fell victim to an irritating and persistent skin complaint which was common in the trenches and did not respond to treatment. He was evacuated to England and after a brief period in hospital was sent to the Imperial Hydro at St Annes, where he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not be fit to return to his unit for six months.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{is said to}} {{have been}} found {{enclosed}} in a wooden box in a dry cave in the highlands of Chiapas near Tortuguero; it was said to have been found with a turquoise mask that is now in the collection of Dumbarton Oaks. In 1965 Mexican collector Dr. Josué Sáenz was taken by two men on a light plane to a remote airstrip in the foothills of the Sierra Madre near Tortuguero in Tabasco state; the compass of the plane was covered with a cloth but Sáenz recognized his approximate location. At the airstrip he was shown the codex along with some other looted Maya artifacts and <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could take the items back to Mexico City for authentication before purchasing them. The antiquities expert that Sáenz consulted declared that the artifacts were fakes but Sáenz later purchased the codex and permitted Michael Coe to display the codex at the Grolier Club in 1971. In 1976, the United States-Mexico Artifacts Treaty of 1970 was invoked by the Attorney General of Mexico. This resulted in the seizure of the codex and its return to Mexico. Sáenz donated the codex to the Mexican government and it is currently kept in a vault in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City and is not on public display. The claimed discovery of the Grolier Codex would make it the only pre-Columbian codex discovered in the course of the 20th century, except for some codex fragments excavated by archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Under the new {{management}} of Andy Hessenthaler, Julian started the 2010–11 season as first choice goalkeeper, {{starting in the}} club's {{first game of the}} season, a 1–1 draw with Cheltenham Town on 7 August 2010. However, similarly to the 2009–10 season, Julian lost his first-team place after a winless run {{at the start of the}} campaign. New signing Lance Cronin impressed in an away draw against Morecambe, and kept Julian out of the first-team for five weeks. After Gillingham's 7–4 away loss at Accrington Stanley, Julian regained his first-team place, playing in a 2–1 home win against Stockport County on 9 October 2010. Julian was part of the side that ended Gillingham's 35 game winless away streak when they won 1–0 against Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium on 20 November 2010, making a number of key saves during the game. He remained as first choice goalkeeper throughout the season as Gillingham finished in eighth position in League Two, narrowly missing out on a play-off place after losing three out of their last four games. Julian made 41 appearances for Gillingham in all competitions during the 2010–11 season, keeping 12 clean sheets. Despite being the club's first choice goalkeeper during the campaign, Julian <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> no longer featured in the club's plans, and was subsequently released on 11 May 2011.
