5|$|While {{the doctor}} {{talks with the}} police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an {{abandoned}} German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring {{his face in the}} process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> into the woods outside Génessier's house with one of the freed doves on her hand.|$|E
25|$|Web-based spiders have poor spatial {{appreciation}} and {{get much of}} their information from reading tensions and movement in their web. P. africana, P. fimbraba and P. labiata can use their eight legs and two palps to pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of movements, using a trial and error method, until it finds and repeats a set of movements that either lures the prey {{out into the open}} or calms the prey while the Portia <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> close enough to bite the victim. If the prey stops being controlled by the sequence, the Portia tries new combinations until one works, and then repeats the new sequence. While such hunting shows use of least short-term memory, as of 2011 researchers do not know how long a Portia can retain such memories nor whether a Portia may use different trial and error starts for some prey species.|$|E
500|$|The {{black stork}} {{is a large}} bird, {{measuring}} between [...] in length with a [...] wingspan, and weighing around [...] Standing as tall as , it has long red legs, a long neck and a long, straight, pointed red beak. It bears some resemblance to Abdim's stork (C. abdimii), which can be distinguished by its much smaller build, predominantly green bill, legs and feet, and white rump and lower back. The plumage is black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, armpits, axillaries and undertail coverts. The breast feathers are long and shaggy, forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The black stork has brown irises, and bare red skin around its eyes. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. Moulting takes place in spring, with the iridescent sheen brighter in new plumage. It <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> and steadily {{on the ground and}} like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.|$|E

500|$|A Portia can pluck another spider's web with a {{virtually}} unlimited range of signals, either {{to lure the}} prey {{out into the open}} or calming the prey by monotonously repeating the same signal while the Portia <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> close enough to bite it. Such tactics enable Portia species to take web spiders from 10% to 200% of a Portia′s size, and Portia species hunt in all types of webs. In contrast, other cursorial spiders generally have difficulty moving on webs, and web-building spiders find it difficult to move in webs unlike those they build. When hunting in another spider's web, a Portia′s slow, choppy movements and the flaps on its legs make it resemble leaf detritus caught in the web and blown in a breeze. P. fimbriata and some other Portia species use breezes and other disturbances as [...] "smokescreens" [...] in which these predators can approach web spiders more quickly, and revert to a more cautious approach when the disturbance disappears. A few web spiders run far away when they sense the un-rhythmical gait of a Portia entering the web – a reaction Wilcox and Jackson call [...] "Portia panic".|$|E
500|$|A web spider's web is an {{extension}} of the web spider's senses, informing the spider of vibrations that signal the arrival of prey and predators. If the intruder is another web spider, these vibrations vary widely depending on the new web spider's species, sex and experience. A Portia can pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of signals, either to lure the prey out into the open or calming the prey by monotonously repeating the same signal while the Portia <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> close enough to bite it. Such tactics enable Portias to take web spiders from 10% to 200% of a Portia′s size, and Portias hunt in all types of webs. In contrast, other cursorial spiders generally have difficulty moving on webs, and web-building spiders find it difficult to move in webs unlike those they build: sticky webs adhere to cursorial spiders and to web-builders of non-sticky webs; builders of cribellate webs have difficulty with non-cribellate webs, and vice versa. Where the web is sparse, a Portia will use [...] "rotary probing", in which it moves a free leg around until it meets a thread. When hunting in another spider's web, a Portia′s slow, choppy movement and the flaps on its legs make it resemble leaf detritus caught in the web and blown in a breeze. P. labiata and some other Portias use breezes and other disturbances as [...] "smokescreens" [...] in which these predators can approach web spiders more quickly, and revert to a more cautious approach when the disturbance disappears.

2500|$|New York [...] has {{the social}} faults which belong to an eminently {{business}} place, {{and to a}} shifting, moneymaking people. Everything there is confused, and every man there is busily pursuing some selfish aim. One who <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> in the streets {{is in danger of}} being run over, and everybody is so much in a hurry there that, in such a case, no resident would probably stop to pick him up.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common dowsing rod is a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush. Some dowsers prefer {{branches}} from particular trees, and some prefer the branches to be freshly cut. Hazel twigs in Europe and witch-hazel in the United States are traditionally commonly chosen, as are branches from willow or peach trees. The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. Often the branches are grasped palms down. The dowser then <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> over the places where he suspects the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing rod dips, inclines or twitches when a discovery is made. This method is sometimes known as [...] "willow witching".|$|E
2500|$|... "Alive" [...] {{has been}} {{revealed}} by Vedder {{to be part}} autobiographical and part fiction. When Vedder was a teenager, his mother revealed {{to him that the}} man he thought was his father was actually his stepfather, and that his biological father was dead. The first and last verses detail those actual events, but the second verse is storytelling on Vedder's part. The lyrics of the second verse read, [...] "Oh, she <b>walks</b> <b>slowly,</b> across a young man's room/She said I'm ready...for you/I can't remember anything to this very day/'Cept the look, the look.../Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare...," [...] and Vedder revealed that [...] "she" [...] was the mother, and [...] "the look" [...] referred to was not the look on her face, but [...] "the look is between her legs. Where do you go with that? That's where you came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'The {{pavement}} {{and the road}} are crowded with purchasers and street-sellers. The housewife in her thick shawl, with the market-basket on her arm, <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> on, stopping now {{to look at the}} stall of caps, and now to cheapen a bunch of greens. Little boys, holding three or four onions in their hand, creep between the people, wriggling their way through every interstice, and asking for custom in whining tones, as if seeking charity. Then the tumult of the thousand different cries of the eager dealers, all shouting {{at the top of their}} voices, at one and the same time, is almost bewildering. [...] "So-old again," [...] roars one. [...] "Chestnuts all'ot, a penny a score," [...] bawls another. [...] "An 'aypenny a skin, blacking," [...] squeaks a boy. [...] "Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy-- bu-u-uy!" [...] cries the butcher. [...] "Half-quire of paper for a penny," [...] bellows the street stationer. [...] "An 'aypenny a lot ing-uns." [...] “Twopence a pound grapes." [...] “Three a penny Yarmouth bloaters." [...] “Who'll buy a bonnet for fourpence?" [...] “Pick 'em out cheap here! three pair for a halfpenny, bootlaces." [...] “Now's your time! beautiful whelks, a penny a lot." [...] “Here's ha'p‘orths," [...] shouts the perambulating confectioner. [...] "Come and look at 'em! here's toasters!" [...] bellows one with a Yarmouth bloater stuck on a toasting-fork. [...] "Penny a lot, fine russets," [...] calls the apple woman: and so the Babel goes on.' ...|$|E

6000|$|LUCREZIA (looking up and {{stretching}} forth her hands). Sidney.... (DOLPHIN {{does not look}} round, and disappears through the glass door into the hotel, LUCREZIA covers {{her face with her}} hands and sits for a little sobbing silently. The nightingale sings on. Midnight sounds with an infinite melancholy from all the twenty campaniles of the city in the valley. From far away comes the spasmodic throbbing of a guitar and the singing of an Italian voice, high-pitched, passionate, throaty. The seconds pass, LUCREZIA rises to her feet and <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> into the hotel. On the threshold she encounters the VICOMTE coming out.) ...|$|E
60|$|There is a capacious writing-table in {{the room}} on which is a pretty large {{accumulation}} of papers. The green lamp is lighted, his reading-glasses lie upon the desk, the easy-chair is wheeled up to it, and it would seem {{as though he had}} intended to bestow an hour or so upon these claims on his attention before going to bed. But he happens not to be in a business mind. After a glance at the documents awaiting his notice--with his head bent low over the table, the old man's sight for print or writing being defective at night--he opens the French window and steps out upon the leads. There he again <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> {{up and down in the}} same attitude, subsiding, if a man so cool may have any need to subside, from the story he has related downstairs.|$|E

6000|$|Behold! {{a temple}} set amid sands and washed by a wide, palm-bordered river, and across its pyloned court processions of priests, who pass {{to and fro}} with flaunting banners. The court empties; I could see {{the shadow of a}} falcon's wings that fled across its sunlit floor. A man clad in a priest's white robe, shaven-headed, and barefooted, enters through the {{southern}} pylon gate and <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> towards a painted granite shrine, in which sits the image of a woman crowned with the double crown of Egypt, surmounted by a lotus bloom, and holding in her hand the sacred sistrum. Now, as though he heard some sound, he halts and looks towards us, and by the heaven above me, his face is the face of Leo Vincey in his youth, the face too of that Kallikrates whose corpse we had seen in the Caves of Kor! ...|$|E
6000|$|SCENE--The Borders of a Gentleman's Estate in a Tropical Land. An old Indian, with a mahogany-coloured face, is {{trimming}} the grass on a grave by a mangrove swamp. Presently he rises {{to his feet}} and <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> toward a grove that is shaded by the gathering, brief twilight. In the edge of the grove stand a man who is stalwart, with a kind and courteous air, and a woman of a serene and clear-cut loveliness. When the old Indian comes up to them the man drops money in his hand. The grave-tender, with the stolid pride of his race, takes it as his due, and goes his way. The two in the edge of the grove turn back along the dim pathway, and walk close, close--for, after all, what is the world at its best but a little round field of the moving pictures with two walking together in it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “After {{performing}} Tawaf, the pilgrim should {{issue from}} the gate ‘Al-Safa’ (or another, if necessary), and ascend the steps of Mount Safa, about a man’s height from the street.[FN#28] There he raises the cry Takbir, and implores pardon for his sins. He then descends, and turns towards Mount Marwah at a slow pace. Arrived within six cubits of the Mil al-Akhzar (the ‘green pillar,’ planted {{in the corner of}} the temple on the left hand), he runs swiftly till he reaches the ‘two green pillars,’ the left one of which is fixed {{in the corner of the}} temple, and the other close to the Dar al-Abbas.[FN#29] Thence he again <b>walks</b> <b>slowly</b> up to Marwah, and ascends it as he did Safa. This concludes a single course. The pilgrim then starts from Marwah, and walks, runs, and walks again through the same limits, till the seventh course is concluded.|$|E
