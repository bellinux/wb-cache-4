5|$|The {{existence}} of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. A 2009 British study concluded that its existence is unproven and subjective, based on questionnaires and personal experience. Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women <b>who</b> <b>report</b> having orgasms during vaginal intercourse. It is also hypothesized that the G-spot {{is an extension of}} the clitoris and that this is the cause of orgasms experienced vaginally.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptologists {{identifying}} Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus, Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius <b>who</b> <b>report</b> that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 {{years of}} reign in his Aegyptiaca. Ryholt relies instead on a statistical method and estimates {{the duration of}} Sheshi's reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method consists in tallying the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then, knowing that the first four of these kings reigned for at least c. 30 years, implies that they have left between 7.5 and 20 seals per year on throne. Consequently, Sheshi's nearly 400 scarabs would correspond to 20 to 53 years, which Ryholt gives as c. 40 years.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States <b>who</b> <b>report</b> several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about {{the pros and cons}} of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E

40|$|During 1995, over 20, 000 {{adolescents}} {{completed the}} in-home interview for The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). One question asked females {{if they had}} ever been forced to have sexual intercourse (FSI). In addition, they were asked about other sexual behavior, their psychological well-being, and behavior problems. The present study examines the associations between FSI and 26 outcome variables, comparing adolescent females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> FSI with females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> voluntary intercourse, and with females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no intercourse. In addition, the large Add Health sample allowed comparisons between five race/ethnicity groups and four adolescent groups broken down by age. Psychological and emotional correlates of sexual abuse have been widely documented, but until now, studies of sexual abuse had largely consisted of small samples of mostly White females with limited generalizability. The Add Health sample was large enough to go beyond psychopathology to include risky sexual behavior, and behavior problems. The Add Health sample {{is representative of the}} overall population of adolescents in the United States during the mid 1990 s. Results showed that females forced to have intercourse have earlier and more frequent risky sexual behavior, more severe symptoms of psychopathology, and {{were much more likely to}} report behavior problems such as smoking, drinking, and drug use (a finding that has been largely unreported) than were females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no intercourse. Drug use was the variable on which females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> forced intercourse and those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no intercourse differed most. Females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> FSI were five times more likely to have reported illicit drug use than were females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no intercourse. Asian and White females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> forced intercourse had the greatest vulnerability for negative outcomes, while African American females <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> forced intercourse had the greatest resilience against negative outcomes. Among female adolescents <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> forced intercourse, the youngest (ages 12, 13, and 14 years) were the most vulnerable to experience severe psychopathology and to report cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{differences}} between women <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> current and past physical or sexual abuse and those who did not in terms of mean total prenatal weight change, the odds for inadequate prenatal gain, and the odds for excessive prenatal gain. METHODS: This study used a matched retrospective cohort design. Data were from the charts of 578 clients of an urban prenatal care clinic. Multiple regression analyses, stratified by maternal age, were conducted to examine the association of past and current abuse with total prenatal weight change and with adequacy of prenatal weight gain for Body Mass Index category. RESULTS: For teens, abuse was not associated with prenatal weight change. For adults, mean total gains were 6. 9 pounds greater for those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> current abuse than for those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no abuse. Compared to women <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no abuse, adults <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> only a history of physical abuse had 3. 1 times the odds, and those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> a history of sexual abuse (with or without physical abuse) had 3. 0 times the odds for inadequate prenatal weight gains. Adults <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> a history of sexual abuse were 2. 4 times as likely to have excessive prenatal weight gains as adults <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no abuse. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship of abuse and prenatal weight gain was different in adults and teens. This study may be the first to report an association between abuse and excessive prenatal gains, suggesting that addressing the psychosocial needs of women may help optimize prenatal weight gain...|$|R
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study aimed {{to establish a}} firmer scientific basis for recognition and treatment of post-traumatic psychiatric morbidity associated with domestic violence. The study used a sample of 335 women (mean age 45. 5 years) recruited from the Royal Brisbane Hospital Emergency Department. This paper reports baseline data. The outcome measures of lifetime psychiatric diagnoses (DSM- 111 –R classification), showed that women <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> lifetime adult intimate abuse (n= 162) received significantly more diagnoses of generalised anxiety, dysthymia, depression, phobias, current harmful alcohol consumption and psychoactive drug dependence than those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no abuse ever (n= 173). Of the 191 women tested for lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder, those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> lifetime abuse (n= 115) received significantly more diagnoses than those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> no abuse (n= 76). Crude prevalence rates of psychiatric diagnoses for women <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> double abuse as child and adult {{were significantly higher than}} for women <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> adult intimate abuse only.

Results Children whose parents reported that school personnel received diabetes training showed significantly better diabetes control than those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> untrained school personnel. Children <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> their classmates received diabetes training had significantly better QOL than those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> untrained classmates.
