6000|$|It {{was what}} sailors call a [...] "dirty night." [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> out upon the sea, {{it seemed as}} if there were nothing there but horrible {{darkness}}.

60|$|In truth, he {{was but a}} small {{descendant}} {{from such}} great warriors. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at their bluff visages and brawny limbs, as depicted in their portraits, {{and then at the}} little Marquis, with his spindle shanks; his sallow lanthern visage, flanked with a pair of powdered ear-locks, or ailes de pigeon, that seemed ready to fly away with it; you would hardly believe him to be of the same race. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at the eyes that sparkled out like a beetle's from each side of his hooked nose, you saw at once that he inherited all the fiery spirit of his forefathers. In fact, a Frenchman's spirit never exhales, however his body may dwindle. It rather rarefies, and grows more inflammable, as the earthly particles diminish; and I have seen valor enough in a little fiery-hearted French dwarf, to have furnished out a tolerable giant.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the same}} about {{attending}} church. Her parents went to one service on Sundays; she insisted on going to all three, and would sit and stand and kneel, book in hand, as if taking a part in it all, but always <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at her, her eyes would meet yours and the sweet smile would come to her lips.|$|E
60|$|The Vicar of Blackstable was a dying man. There was {{no mistaking}} that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at the hollow cheeks and the {{shrunken}} body.

60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{one of them}} was Marhar-Rarrar, the Bright-Eyed; and, in the second place, neither she nor the romps, her companions, ever dreamed of taking the voyage until the doctor and myself {{announced}} our intention; their going along {{was nothing more than a}} madcap frolic; in short, they were a parcel of wicked hoydens, bent on mischief, who laughed in your face <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> sentimental, and only tolerated your company when making merry at your expense.|$|E
60|$|But {{the creatures}} led their captives {{away from the}} rocks and the road, down the hill by a side path until they came before a low {{mountain}} of rock {{that looked like a}} huge bowl turned upside down. At the edge of this mountain was a deep gulf--so deep that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> into it there was nothing but blackness below. Across the gulf was a narrow bridge of rock, and {{at the other end of}} the bridge was an arched opening that led into the mountain.|$|E

[...] "And it wasn't just {{the trees and the}} grass with the yellow dandelions, it was the houses, too--I've often wondered why those houses pleased me so much. I wanted to live in every one of them. Do you know that feeling?" [...] Mrs. Maturin nodded. [...] "They didn't hurt your eyes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at them, and they seemed to be so much at home there, even the new ones.
