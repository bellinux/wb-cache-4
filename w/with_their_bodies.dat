5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times.

Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} done to examine the {{relationship}} between sex and perception of body image among athletes and nonathletes. A total of 211 men and women athletes and nonathletes completed a questionnaire which asked them to identify from a nine-figure body-silhouette scale their current image and the image that they thought was most ideal. t tests showed no significant differences for men based upon athletic participation and that both athletes and nonathleces were satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> image. However, when comparing current image and ideal image, significant differences were found for women athletes and nonathletes. These data support previous research documenting women's dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> images and show athletic participation is not associated with this perception...|$|R
25|$|On {{account of}} the {{evolution}} of society today; text messaging, e-mails, social media, and other technological advancements, have dominated an individual’s sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a “platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies”. According to a study by Dove, only 4% of women thought they were beautiful, while approximately 70% of women and girls believed the media’s portrayal of impractical beauty standards fuelled their appearance anxieties. As a result, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that, 91% of women were most unhappy <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic {{doctrine}} of {{the resurrection of the}} body does nor subscribe that, sees body and soul as forming a whole and states that at the second coming, the souls of the departed will be reunited <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> as a whole person (substance) and witness to the apocalypse. The thorough consistency between dogma and contemporary science was maintained here in part from a serious attendance to the principle that there can be only one truth. Consistency with science, logic, philosophy, and faith remained a high priority for centuries, and a university doctorate in theology generally included the entire science curriculum as a prerequisite. This doctrine is not universally accepted by Christians today. Many believe that one's immortal soul goes directly to Heaven upon death of the body.|$|E
25|$|The general {{process for}} a typical {{courtship}} interaction begins when a male flies and lands near a perching female, who is most likely perched on a host plant, such as several species of the Passiflora genus. Once the male has landed, the male assumes a position next to the female with their heads together and <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> aligned at a 45-degree angle. At this time, the male engages in a specific action called the wing clap display in which the male continuously claps its wings open and closed. During this time, the antennae of the female are placed between the opening and closing wings. After the male ceases wing movement, the male butterfly will move into a position that facilitates genital contact with the female. The average duration of the copulation process including the wing clap display is approximately 11 seconds.|$|E

The older female workers are located on the exterior; in the interior are the younger female workers. At the smallest disturbance, soldiers gather on the top surface of the bivouac, ready to defend the nest with powerful pincers and (in the case of the Aenictinae and Ecitoninae) stingers. The interior of the nest is filled with numerous passages and contains many chambers with food, the queen, the larvae, and the eggs.|$|E

25|$|On {{the early}} April, the Massacre of Cólua occurs. The village of Cólua, near Aldeia Viçosa, Uíge had been {{attacked}} and its inhabitants massacred by UPA.

However an isolated group of soldiers (including two officers) which remained behind is ambushed, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> being latter found horribly mutilated. Another military patrol that was sent to the area is also ambushed, with some of their members falling into UPA's hands and being also tortured, mutilated and killed. 30 civilians and 11 military are eventually killed at Cólua. Later testimonies refer that the UPA militants practiced acts of cannibalism, eating parts of the dead bodies of the soldiers. The Cólua events had an important psychological effect in the Portuguese forces, not only due to horrifying acts practiced against its soldiers, but also because they realized that the insurgents now dared to attack military forces and not just defenseless civilians.|$|E

In addition, Fred claimed the reason many phalange bones had been missing from the victims' bodies was because the removal of their fingers and toes {{had been one of the}} actual forms of torture the victims had endured, with additional torture methods including the extraction of their nails, acts of mutilation, and cigarettes being stubbed out on their bodies. Furthermore, the actual locations of almost all the burial sites of victims—both discovered and undiscovered—was symbolic to Fred, as each had been buried at or very close to the location he had lived in or worked at the time of the victim's murder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the overall body dissatisfaction and in specific areas in adolescents who practice artistic gymnastic in elite and non-elite levels, and to analyze the influence of sociodemographic, anthropometric and maturational factors on body dissatisfaction. The research is characterized as transversal, quantitative, descriptive and correlational. The sample consisted of 285 adolescents, of both sexes, practicing gymnastics. They {{were divided into two}} groups: 245 non-elite athletes and 40 elite athletes. The participants were aged between 10 and 18 years (mean 12. 86 ± 1. 80) and were resident of the city of Três Rios-RJ. The assessment instruments were: Body Shape Questionnaire, Body Areas Scale, Critério de Classificação Econômica Brasil and socio-demographic questionnaire. Anthropometric and somatic maturation data were collected. The results showed that 24. 9 % of the non-elite athletes and 15 % of elite athletes were dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> as a whole. For specific body areas, nonelite athletes were significantly more dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> area &# 8220;weight&# 8221; than the elite athletes. Sociodemographic and economic factors had no influence on overall body dissatisfaction. For non-elite athletes, only the body percentage of fat and somatic maturation were predictors for the overall body dissatisfaction and in specific areas, respectively. It was concluded that the non-elite athletes were more dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> and weight than the elite athletes...|$|R
