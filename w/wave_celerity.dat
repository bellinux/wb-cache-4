25|$|Stokes' first {{definition}} of <b>wave</b> <b>celerity</b> has, for a pure wave motion, the mean {{value of the}} horizontal Eulerian flow-velocity ŪE at any location below trough level equal to zero. Due to the irrotationality of potential flow, together with the horizontal sea bed and periodicity the mean horizontal velocity, the mean horizontal velocity is a constant between bed and trough level. So in Stokes first definition the wave is considered from a frame of reference moving with the mean horizontal velocity ŪE. This is an advantageous approach when the mean Eulerian flow velocity ŪE is known, e.g. from measurements.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' second {{definition}} of <b>wave</b> <b>celerity</b> {{is for a}} frame of reference where the mean horizontal mass transport of the wave motion equal to zero. This {{is different from the}} first definition due to the mass transport in the splash zone, i.e. between the trough and crest level, in the wave propagation direction. This wave-induced mass transport is caused by the positive correlation between surface elevation and horizontal velocity. In the reference frame for Stokes' second definition, the wave-induced mass transport is compensated by an opposing undertow (so ŪE<nbsp&0 for waves propagating in the positive x-direction). This is the logical definition for waves generated in a wave flume in the laboratory, or waves moving perpendicular towards a beach.|$|E

The material can be made stiff in tension and soft in compression or vice versa. This asymmetry results in different <b>wave</b> <b>celerities</b> of tensile and compressive components of elastic waves. The faster component overtakes the slower one and results in their dissipative annihilation through high-frequency energy cascades. We discuss the mechanism of this damping, efficient signal-absorbing assemblies, and relevant material architectures. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Experiments are carried out using a gel of constant density ρ, shear modulus μ, put in a rigid cylindrical dish of depth h. When turned upside down, the free surface of the gel undergoes a normal outgoing acceleration g. It remains perfectly flat for ρ g h/μ<α^* with α^*≃ 6, whereas a steady pattern spontaneously appears in the opposite case. This phenomenon results from the interplay between the gravitational energy and the elastic energy of deformation, which reduces the Rayleigh <b>waves</b> <b>celerity</b> and vanishes it at the threshold...|$|R

Three main contributions are presented herein, namely: (1) the ability of the proposed model to simulate mixed flows without restriction of the flow type in the free surface region (e. g., supercritical flow), (2) extension of our single-phase flow model for simulating the entrapment and release of air pockets, and (3) formulation of an approach for handling numerical instabilities that may occur during numerical pressurization of the flow.

40|$|Derivations and {{analyses}} of basic equations for I-dimensional sediment-laden flow (concentrations {{up to about}} 10 % of volume) on a mobile bed are presented. Equations of mass and momentum conservation have been derived {{by means of a}} control section as well as by depth integration. Therefore a three-layer approach has been used (i. e., bed layer, bed-load layer, and suspended-load layer). Despite the assumptions of uniform sediment, fixed banks and constant width the derivations can easily be extended for more general models. Analysis of the basic equations b means of the method of characteristics showed that with increasing concentration <b>wave</b> <b>celerities</b> alter, and showed that critical flow occurs at Froude numbers less than unity. A stability analysis of the equations showed that the criterion for occurrence of roll waves in supercritical flow is also modified by the increased concentration. Due to increased concentrations roll waves can occur in sediment-laden flow at lower Froude numbers than in clear water flow. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

In this paper we test {{the ability of}} the Radon Transform to produce estimates of individual <b>wave</b> <b>celerities</b> and to separate incoming and outgoing waves conserving the temporal characteristics. The Radon Transform is a projection of a two-dimensional field into polar space. Oblique features such as propagating crests in a spatio-temporal space are identified with density peaks in the polar space. In this paper, the Radon Transform is applied to synthetic test cases including a wide range of beach slopes and wave conditions. The Radon Transform shows good skills at estimating individual celerity and separating incoming and outgoing components with a relative RMS error lower than 10 %, even a standing wave node. The accuracy is fairly insensitive to wave characteristics whereas the main limitations rise from the sampling scheme and are the number and density of wave gauges.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{problem of}} a brake-like mechanical system composed of an elastic cylindrical tube with Coulomb's friction in contact with a rigid and rotating cylinder is considered. This model problem enables us to give an example of non-trivial periodic solutions {{in the form of}} stick-slip or stick-slip-separation waves propagating on the contact surface. A semi-analytical analysis of stick-slip waves is obtained when the system of governing equations is reduced by condensation to a simpler system involving only the contact displacements. This reduced system, of only one space variable in addition to time, can be solved almost analytically and gives some interesting informations on the existence and the characteristics of stick-slip waves such as the wave numbers on the circumference, stick and slip proportions, <b>wave</b> <b>celerities,</b> tangential and normal forces. It is shown in particular that the stick-slip-separation solutions would occur for small normal pressures or high rotational speeds. Since the analytical discussion becomes cumbersome in this case, a second approach based on numerical analysis by the finite element method is performed. The existence and the characteristics of stick-slip and stick-slip-separation waves are discussed numerically...|$|R
40|$|When a steep, {{breaking}} wave hits a vertical sea wall in shallow water, a flip-through eventmay occur, {{leading to the}} formation of an up-rushing planar jet. During such an event, a jet of water is ejected at a speed many times larger than the approaching <b>wave's</b> <b>celerity.</b> As the jet rises, the bounded fluid sheet ruptures to form vertical ligaments which subsequently break up to form droplets, creating a polydisperse spray. Experiments in the University of Hokkaido's 24 m flume measured the resulting droplet sizes using image analysis of high-speed video. Consideration of the mechanisms forming spray droplets shows that the number density of droplet sizes is directly proportional to a power p of the droplet radius: where p=- 5 / 2 during the early break-up stage and p=- 2 for the fully fragmented state. This was confirmed by experimental observations. Here, we show that the recorded droplet number density follows the lognormal probability distribution with parameters related to the elapsed time since the initial wave impact. This statistical model of polydisperse spray may provide a basis for modelling droplet advection during wave overtopping events, allowing atmospheric processes leading to enhanced fluxes of mass, moisture, heat and momentum in the spray-mediated marine boundary layer over coasts to be described...|$|R
40|$|Rip {{currents}} {{are among}} the most dangerous coastal hazards for the bathing public, and contribute to the highest portion of beach rescues all over the world. In order to help life guards in planning and preparing rescue resources so as to minimize casualties, information about where and when rip currents may occur is needed. This can be provided by a predictive tool which combines meteorological forecasts, hydrodynamic models and remote-sensed observations. In this thesis, a methodology with which rip current forecasts for swimmer safety can be provided is developed and tested for Egmond aan Zee beach in the Netherlands. The approach is {{to make use of the}} numerical model system CoSMoS combined with daily estimates of nearshore-scale bathymetry obtained from a system called cBathy, which infers depths by estimating <b>wave</b> <b>celerities</b> from video imaging. Moreover, in order to gain more knowledge on occurrences of rips at Egmond, a numerical study on the kinematics of rip currents and the safety implications for swimmers is also presented. Coupling the video bathymetry estimates with CoSMoS in forecast mode shows that dangerous rips were correctly predicted.

40|$|International audienceThe mapped {{rivers and}} streams of the {{contiguous}} United States are available in a geographic information system (GIS) dataset called National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus). This hydrographic dataset has about 3 million river and water body reaches along with information on how they are connected into net- works. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) provides stream- ﬂow observations at about 20 thousand gauges located on theNHDPlus river network. Ariver networkmodel called Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge (RAPID) is developed for the NHDPlus river network whose lateral inﬂow to the river network is calculated by a land surface model. A matrix-based version of the Muskingum method is developed herein, which RAPID uses to calculate ﬂow and volume of water in all reaches of a river network with many thousands of reaches, including at ungauged locations. Gauges situated across river basins (not only at basin outlets) are used to automatically optimize the Muskingum parameters and to assess river ﬂow computations, hence allowing the diagnosis of runoff com- putations provided by land surfacemodels. RAPIDis applied to theGuadalupe and SanAntonioRiver basins in Texas, where ﬂow <b>wave</b> <b>celerities</b> are estimated at multiple locations using 15 -min data and can be reproduced reasonably with RAPID.

50|$|A ship {{moving over}} the surface of {{undisturbed}} water sets up waves emanating mainly from the bow and stern of the ship. The waves created by the ship consist of divergent and transverse waves. The divergent waves are observed as the wake of a ship with a series of diagonal or oblique crests moving outwardly from the point of disturbance. These waves were first studied by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who found that regardless of the speed of the ship, they were always contained in the 19 degree (each side) symmetric wedge following the ship. The divergent waves do not cause much resistance against the ships forward motion. However, the transverse waves appear as troughs and crests along the length of a ship and constitute the major part of the wave-making resistance of a ship. The energy associated with the transverse wave system travels at one half the phase velocity or the group velocity of the waves. The prime mover of the vessel must put additional energy into the system in order to overcome this expense of energy. The relationship between the velocity of ships and that of the transverse waves can be found by equating the <b>wave</b> <b>celerity</b> and the ship’s velocity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract It is {{generally}} accepted that the celerity of a discharge wave exceeds {{that of a}} floodwave. The discharge wave is the initial wavefront (shown {{by an increase in}} stage at a particular site), whereas the floodwave refers to the body of water moving downstream. Yet, few studies have investigated the varying relationship between discharge and suspended sediment concentration as floods propagate downstream. This paper examines the relative velocities of the discharge and sediment waves for natural flood events on the River Severn, UK. Four monitoring stations were established within the upper 35 km reach of the River Severn (drainage basin area 380 km 2). Discharge was monitored using fixed structures, and suspended sediment concentrations were monitored at similar locations using Partech IR 40 C turbidity meters.

40|$|The {{upcoming}} Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) {{mission will}} provide unprecedented observations of water elevation in rivers and lakes. The vertical accuracy of SWOT measurements {{is expected to}} be around 10 cm for rivers of width greater than 50 - 100 m. Over France, new observations will be available every 5 days. Such observations will allow new opportunities for validation of hydrological models and for data assimilation within these models. The objective of the proposed work is to evaluate the quality of simulated river water levels in the Garonne River Basin (55, 000 km 2) located in Southwestern France. The simulations are produced using a distributed regional-scale hydrometeorological modeling framework composed of a land surface model (ISBA), a hydrogeological model (MODCOU) and a river network model (RAPID). The modeling framework had been initially calibrated over France although this study focuses on the smaller Garonne Basin and the proposed research emphasizes on modifications made to RAPID. First, the existing RAPID parameters (i. e. temporally-constant but spatially-variable Muskingum parameters) were updated in the Garonne River Basin based on estimations made using a lagged cross correlation method applied to observed hydrographs. Second, the model code was modified to allow for the use of a kinematic or a kinematic-diffusive wave equation for routing, both allowing for temporally and spatially variables <b>wave</b> <b>celerities.</b> Such modification required prescribing the values of hydraulic parameters of the river-channel. Initial results show that the variable flow velocity scheme is advantageous for discharge computations when compared to the original Muskingum method in RAPID. Additionally, water level computations led to root mean square errors of 50 - 60 cm in the improved Muskingum method and 40 - 50 cm in the kinematic-diffusive wave method. Discharge computations were also shown to be comparable to those obtained with high-resolution models solving the full 1 D Saint-Venant equations. Similar comparisons are more challenging for water levels because of their strong dependence on the choice of hydraulic parameters and their spatial variability, but spatial-averaging leads to satisfactory results. The improved model will be used in the future to perform sensitivity studies and implement data assimilation strategies that are adapted to the most significant sources of uncertainty in the modeling framework...|$|R

40|$|Flume {{measurements}} of a one-dimensional sliding hump starting from rest in quiescence fresh water indicate {{that when the}} hump travels at speed less than the shallow-water <b>wave</b> <b>celerity,</b> three waves emerge, travelling in two directions. One wave travels {{in the opposite direction}} to the sliding hump at approximately the shallow-water <b>wave</b> <b>celerity</b> (backward free wave). Another wave travels approximately in step with the hump (forced wave), and the remaining wave travels {{in the direction of the}} hump at approximately the shallow-water <b>wave</b> <b>celerity</b> (forward free wave). These experiments were completed for a range of sliding hump speed relative to the shallow-water <b>wave</b> <b>celerity,</b> up to unity of this ratio, to investigate possible derivation from solutions of the Euler equation with non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms being included or excluded. For the experimental arrangements tested, the forced waves were negative (depression or reduced water surface elevation) waves while the free waves were positive (bulges or increased water surface elevation). For experiments where the sliding hump travelled at less than 80 % of the shallow-water <b>wave</b> <b>celerity</b> did not include transient behaviour measurements (i. e. when the three waves still overlapped). The three wave framework was partially supported by these measurements in that the separated forward and forced waves were compared to measurements. For the laboratory scale experiments, the forward free wave height was predicted reasonably by the long-wave equation (ignoring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms) when the sliding hump speed was less than 80 % of the shallow-water <b>wave</b> <b>celerity.</b> The forced wave depression magnitude required the Euler equations for all hump speed tested. The long-wave solution, while being valid in a limited parameter range, does predict the existence of the three waves as found in these experiments (forward travelling waves measured quantitatively while the backward travelling waves visually by video). Nevertheless, the forced wave transient development required non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms for higher sliding hump speeds. The forward free wave, controversially, does not need non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms until much higher hump speeds, suggesting that the forward free wave falls in the parameter space where long-wave equations apply whereas the forced wave more often falls into the parameter space requiring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms. It does raise the question of why the forced wave transient dynamics does not impact on the initial transient dynamics where the forward free wave is in the long-wave theory, escaping the forced wave (at least for speeds less than 80 % of the shallow-water <b>wave</b> <b>celerity)</b> ...|$|E
