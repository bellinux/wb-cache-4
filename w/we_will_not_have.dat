2500|$|Five days later, the JNA {{attacked}} the Croat village of Ravno in eastern Herzegovina {{on their way}} to attack Dubrovnik, and in the first days of October it leveled it, killing eight Croat civilians. The objectives of the nationalists in Croatia were shared by Croat nationalists in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), organised and controlled the branch of the party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the latter part of 1991, the more extreme elements of the party, under the leadership of Mate Boban, Dario Kordić, Jadranko Prlić, Ignac Koštroman, as well as local leaders such as Anto Valenta, and with the support of Franjo Tuđman and Gojko Šušak, had taken effective control of the party. This coincided with the peak of the Croatian War of Independence. On 6 October 1991, Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović gave a televised proclamation of neutrality that included the statement 'Remember, this is not our war. Let those who want it have it. We do not want that war'. In the meantime, president Alija Izetbegović made the following statement before the Bosnian parliament on October 14 with regard to the JNA: 'Do not do anything against the Army. (…) the presence of the Army is a stabilizing factor to us, and we need that Army (…).

And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state." [...] Romney added, [...] "There are some people who say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel."

40|$|Thesis (M. A., English (Literature)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. Despite {{her early}} {{experiments}} with the epistolary form, none of Jane Austen???s published novels {{are in the}} epistolary form. However, all of Austen???s novels contain letters, {{many of which are}} crucial {{to the development of the}} story. This paper will explore the role and function of letters in Austen's novels. Looking closely at each letter, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> see how Austen uses letters to reveal character and advance plot. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> also see how writing letters gives Austen???s characters a rhetorical voice, and how letters forge communication when it is otherwise impossible (not only physically, but socially and emotionally as well). Finally, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> explore how letters can lead characters to self-knowledge. By looking at how letters function in Austen???s novels, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> only <b>have</b> a better understanding of her characters, but <b>we</b> <b>will</b> also have a better understanding of the role and significance of letters in Austen???s time.

40|$|Philipp Frank––physicist, philosopher, {{and early}} {{member of the}} Vienna Circle––is often {{neglected}} in retrospective accounts of twentieth century philosophy of science, despite renewed interest {{in the work of}} the Vienna Circle. In this thesis, I argue that this neglect is unwarranted. Appealing to a variety of philosophical and historical sources, I trace the development of Frank’s philosophical thought and, in so doing highlight the roles played by history, sociology, values, and pragmatism in his philosophy of science. Turning to contemporary literature, I then argue that Frank’s work should be understood as an early instance of what is now called “socially engaged philosophy of science. ” This understanding is explored through a careful consideration of his work on education, where previous work on history, sociology, values, and pragmatism is applied to an important, real-world problem. This socially engaged reading of Frank extends beyond pragmatic issues of theory application, because as I show, Frank used sociology to argue for the meaningfulness of metaphysical claims. However, Frank’s account of meaning may seem to be problematic since it heavily relies on Percy Bridgman’s operationalism. So, I outline the problems associated with Bridgman’s account of operationalism and show that Frank’s view does not fall prey to the same criticisms. After these objections are addressed, Frank’s work is contextualized in the broader debate about value-free science, where I argue that Frank did not endorse the value-free ideal. As a result of these findings, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> only <b>have</b> a clearer picture of Frank’s philosophical contributions, but also a better understanding of how the philosophy of science can better engage important social issues...|$|R

With his permission, I brought the manuscripts back to Kunming, made three photocopies, and returned to him the original text and the three photocopies. Teacher Long was pleased. I then asked for his permission to keep one of the photocopies and promised him that I would eventually learn to read the Pollard script.
