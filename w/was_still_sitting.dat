5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house. A degaussing cable was added during this same refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC, but it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no effort was made to repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Villeneuve {{arrived at}} Fort de France, Martinique on 14 May, and was joined {{over the next}} two days by the Spanish under Gravina. Having resupplied, he settled in to await the arrival of Ganteaume, who unbeknownst to him <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> {{blockaded}} in Brest. Initially reluctant to undertake any large scale assaults on the British possessions in the Caribbean without orders, he was finally persuaded by the Governor of Martinique to attack the British held Diamond Rock after two weeks of sitting idle at anchor. The small garrison surrendered on 2 June, by which time the frigate Didon had arrived with orders. Villeneuve was instructed to await the arrival of two extra ships under Rear-Admiral René Magon, and then spend a month attacking and capturing the British colonies in the West Indies. He was then to sail his entire force back to Europe, join Ganteaume at Brest and cover the invasion flotilla. The orders also noted that Nelson had sailed to Egypt in search of him. In fact Nelson was by now only two days away from Barbados, where he would anchor on 4 June. Villeneuve gathered his forces and pressed northwards towards Antigua, but on 7 June he came across a lightly defended convoy of British merchants, and captured several of them the following day. From them he discovered that Nelson had arrived at Barbados. A shocked Villeneuve decided to break off operations and head north and east again, back to Europe. The fleet got underway on 11 June, causing one of the army officers attached to the fleet, General Honoré Charles Reille to note We have been masters of the sea for three weeks with a landing force of 7000 to 8000 men and {{have not been able to}} attack a single island.|$|E
500|$|Boyle was {{a member}} of the Presbyterian Church, the Masonic Order, and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> as a judge when he died February 15, 1936, on his way to Jamaica. The Edmonton {{neighbourhood}} of Boyle Street and the village of Boyle are named in his honour; perhaps ironically, the latter lies on what was once the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway line.|$|E

500|$|Justice Grier further {{instructed}} {{the grand jury}} that it was unnecessary {{for the government to}} produce the corpse to prosecute a murder. But, on September 27, while the grand jury <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>sitting,</b> Jonathan Leete's clothed body was recovered in Goose Creek, Jamaica, Queens. The body was shown to the Leetes' sister for identification, and a portion of the clothing was sent to his mother in Guilford for further identification, which was inconclusive. The forehead of the corpse bore [...] "two distinct wounds, as if the result of blows from a hatchet or hammer." [...] The coroner cited the wounds as the cause of death. The Leete family offered their opinion that Elijah had been at the wheel, Jackalow at the lookout, and Jonathan asleep in the berth prior to the murders. (It was the habit of the Leete brothers to sleep fully clothed.) ...|$|E
500|$|To the west, the 1903 {{proposed}} extension from Knightsbridge to Hammersmith via Kensington High Street remained, {{but it was}} to [...] continue beyond Hammersmith under King Street, [...] {{the final}} station being at the junction of King Street, Goldhawk Road and Chiswick High Road. The tunnels were to continue beyond the final station for a further [...] under Chiswick High Road, to end at the junction with Homefield Road. The loop north from Hammersmith to Shepherd's Bush was dropped; instead a more direct route to Shepherd's Bush was proposed as a branch from the Hammersmith extension at Addison Road. It was to run under Holland Road to Shepherd's Bush Green, with a station being constructed opposite the CLR station there. It would then continue west under Uxbridge Road to Acton Vale, where a depot was to be built on the surface between Agnes Road and Davis Road. To {{cover the cost of}} the proposed extensions, powers to raise further capital of £4.2 million were sought. The review of the bill in Parliament was delayed as the Royal Commission <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> {{during the first half of}} 1905; the bill was withdrawn by the GNP in July 1905, as insufficient time then remained for completion the parliamentary process before the end of the session.|$|E
