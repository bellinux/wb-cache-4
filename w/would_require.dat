5|$|NATO further welcomed Ukraine’s {{desire to}} achieve full {{integration}} into NATO, but stressed that this <b>would</b> <b>require</b> more than troop contributions and defence reform. This <b>would</b> <b>require</b> showing {{commitment to the}} values that underpin the Alliance (democracy, rule of law, {{freedom of speech and}} media, and fair elections) as was foreseen in the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan, which was adopted during the 2002 Prague Summit. In particular NATO Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer criticized Kuchma's record on freedom of press and preparations for the Ukrainian presidential election of November 2004.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{route for}} an O-Bahn was for an alignment {{adjacent to the}} Noarlunga Centre railway line from {{the city to the}} Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn <b>would</b> <b>require</b> moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass <b>would</b> <b>require</b> alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on road upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.|$|E
5|$|Purchase the Puma (IFV) – More lethal {{than the}} GCV, combat {{survival}} and protection at better rates, {{and just as}} mobile. Purchasing the Puma would save $14.8 billion and was considered the most capable of the vehicles. Puma IFVs only carry six infantrymen, which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys. Development and production <b>would</b> <b>require</b> collaboration with foreign companies and governments.|$|E

There are 10,927balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches <b>would</b> <b>require</b> low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E

During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.|$|E
