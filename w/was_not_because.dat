In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift.

5|$|The Indonesian film {{historian}} Misbach Yusa Biran records Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman as {{a commercial}} success. Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised {{the quality of the}} film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story. In the Malayan magazine Film Melayu, a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting of a South East Asian as the titular detective. The critic and filmwriter Saeroen expressed concern that the film's success <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of its quality, and opined that it was only popular because of Wijnhamer's fame.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{introduction}} of a veal-based sandwich raised the ire of animal rights groups. By 1982, several groups were alleging that the veal being sourced to Burger King was most likely kept in battery cages, unable to move, and fed a low iron diet designed to produce the lightly toned meat associated with veal. As {{a result of this}} protest, these groups lead a three-country boycott of Burger King in April 1982. Critics of the boycott claimed that the type of veal that was being used was more-likely to be free range veal due to cost issues, claiming that there is simply no way a $2.00 sandwich would use the higher quality $15.00/lb veal. The rights groups refused to back down despite the cost claims because Burger King would only release the name of the meat processor, not its veal suppliers. The chain eventually announced that it intended to pull the sandwich from the market, stating that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of the boycotts but because {{there was a lack of}} consumer demand. In fact, the chain said the sandwich sold best in the markets where the majority of the protests were occurring.|$|E

5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E

5000|$|An {{abstract}} {{structure has}} a richer structure than a concept or an idea.

25|$|The first British {{synchronizer}} gear {{was built}} by the manufacturer of the machine-gun {{for which it was}} designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers'. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. The fact is that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle, as in Saulnier's design; a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally, on the port side of the forward fuselage, where it was readily accessible for adjustment.|$|E
25|$|If an adjudicator has a pecuniary or {{monetary}} {{interest in}} the matter {{he or she is}} presiding over, no matter how small it is, he or she is automatically disqualified from making the decision. The decision, if made, may be set aside. Thus, in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the House of Lords held that the Lord Chancellor, who was a shareholder of one of the companies that was a party to certain legal proceedings he was presiding over, was disqualified from hearing the case. His ruling had to be annulled. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> there was a real possibility of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint the fairness of the proceedings.|$|E

In spite of the urgings of his friends and the attractiveness of what for the time was the enormous salary of $5000 (plus a good house, rent free), Eliot, after giving considerable thought to the offer, turned it down. One of his biographers speculated that he surely realized by this time that he had a strong taste for organizing and administration. This post would have given it scope.

25|$|In 1996, Prior and Wilson {{wrote that}} the Third Battle of Ypres was called a British failure by many writers. Harris and Sheffield called it a Pyrrhic victory. Research over the last 25 years {{suggests}} that British and German commanders thought carefully {{about what they were}} doing, learned quickly and had efficient forces capable of quick changes of method. The capture of Passchendaele Ridge was extremely difficult, due to the skill and determination of the German army and the huge problem of waging war without great advantages in technology or tactics. The course of the Nivelle Offensive earlier in the year, suggest that a campaign of this nature was unavoidable. Smaller limited operations like the Battle of Messines, the Battle of Hill 70, the Second Offensive Battle of Verdun and the Battle of Malmaison, were strikingly successful but were insufficient to force the German army out of France; this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of poor generalship but due a form of warfare conducted with means made available by industrialisation, fought by closely matched opponents, who made mistakes but mostly fought with determination, using all the skill and technical measures they could find. The defensive methods used by the German army at Arras after 9 April, were not superseded until changes were imposed by Ludendorff after the defeat at Broodseinde on 4 October. The British retained the strategic initiative but failed to capture the Belgian coast and the U-boat bases, although after Broodseinde this was due more to the difficulties of wet weather, than the effectiveness of German resistance.|$|E

500|$|Foster et al. {{argue that}} it is {{unlikely}} there were two incidents, a shooting that was investigated, and a poisoning that <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> <b>because</b> Brown's appearance before the court is common to both stories, but is known to have only occurred {{in the case of the}} shooting murders.

This transformation included the morphing of a cold-blooded shooting into a sly and passive [...] "set and forget" [...] poisoning, where the Aboriginal victims are [...] "complicit in their own demise" [...] by stealing the flour. They arrive at the judgement that, by focussing on a poisoning rather than a shooting, the story plays down the seriousness of the crime. Further, they observe that the murder of Aboriginal people effectively became a plot device, while the horse ride became central to the legend. They conclude that the evolution of the story is [...] "testament to the influence of the 'pioneer legend' in shaping White Australia's view of the past".|$|E
