5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being {{prepared}} for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the doorway of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> an offside position when Travis did put {{the ball in the}} net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed {{during one of his}} routine pit stops due to a problem with a loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the main}} event match, Piper {{revealed}} that the fan humiliated by Lawler in the King's Court segment would be in Piper's corner during the match. Piper started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler's face and attacking him. The match consisted mainly of brawling, and Lawler was frequently distracted by the fan who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> Piper's corner. Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on Piper. He attacked Piper with a foreign object, which knocked Piper to the mat. Then, while trying to pin Piper, Jerry Lawler placed {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage. The fan at ringside pushed Lawler's feet off, however, which allowed Piper to perform a back suplex and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> {{the doorway of the}} cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second door slam the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E

25|$|Up to {{ninety percent}} of {{buildings}} and infrastructure in the Bam area were either damaged or destroyed, with 70% of houses being completely destroyed, plus 70–90% of Bam's residential areas. This left an estimated 100,000 homeless. Not a single house <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> Baravat. An important regional center during the 16th and 17th centuries, Bam contained many buildings that were not constructed to survive such ruptures. Many houses in Bam were homemade, and its owners did not use skilled labor or proper building materials to resist earthquakes in the construction. These were often built in the traditional mud-brick style. Mohsen Aboutorabi, professor of architecture at the University of Central England, demonstrated the lack of good building materials by banging two bricks together in Bam, resulting in cracking. On the other hand, Iranian regulations laid down in the 1989 Iran seismic code. were better enforced in high rise buildings and skyscrapers.|$|E
