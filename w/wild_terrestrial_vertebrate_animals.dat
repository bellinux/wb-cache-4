30|$|Most <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrate</b> <b>animals</b> {{established}} in Europe (or elsewhere throughout the world) were intentionally introduced as commodities, e.g. by the pet trade, the live food trade, or as stock for {{the trade in}} fur pelts [9, 31 – 33]. Although some of these pathways have been modified and restricted {{to reduce the risk}} of invasion, many remain very active. For example, the pet trade remains a dominant pathway for the introduction of new invasive species to Europe [31, 32].|$|R
40|$|Vitamin D, {{synthesized}} in {{the skin}} secondary to UV-B radiation exposure is essential for bone formation and calcium metabolism in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates.</b> <b>Animals</b> housed artificially indoors {{may be at risk}} for osteomalacia (older animals) or rickets (young animals) due to hyperparathyroidism from lack of natural sunlight, the usual source of UV-B radiation. The hypothesis of this study was that inland bearded dragon lizards, Pogona vitticeps, a commonly kept reptile pet, housed in enclosures with various artificial UV-B radiation sources would demonstrate increased bony changes and decreased overall health with decreasing amounts of UV-B radiation. About 25 captive-bred juvenile bearded dragons were housed in groups of 5 for 11 weeks with varying UV-B exposure levels provided by the following treatments: mercury vapor, full spectrum compact fluorescent, hard-quartz fluorescent tube, incandescent and natural sunlight. Contrary to the hypothesis, no significant differences were observed in weight, length or number of crickets consumed among the treatment groups. Serum vitamin D levels were significantly higher in the full spectrum compact fluorescent treatment which corresponded to the lowest UV-B radiation provided. All treatments demonstrated some degree of osteodystrophic changes upon bone histopathology, suggesting that none of the studied exposures may be adequate for optimal lizard health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cadmium is {{a highly}} polluting heavy metal known to have {{undesirable}} effects on health in both animals and humans, targeting the kidneys, the liver and the vascular system. A wide spectrum of deleterious effects has been reported also on the reproductive organs and the developing embryo. Cadmium in fact is a strong endocrine disruptor that interferes with functioning of endogenous receptors and hormones causing detrimental effects on offspring production and survival. In spite of the wide number of studies carried out in laboratory mammals, data on cadmium effects on gonadic tissues, fertility and reproduction of <b>wild</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates</b> are still limited. In particular, information on the consequences of environmental cadmium exposure on reptiles survival and biodiversity is particularly scanty. Reptiles are presently considered highly susceptible to a number of environmental pollutants and this has contributed to the global decline of several wild populations of turtles, crocodilians and lizards. In addition, several reptile species have been identified as good bioindicators of pollution in their environments due to their persistence in a variety of habitats, wide geographic distribution, longevity and site fidelity. In consideration of the few data currently available we decided to investigate cadmium effects on oogonial proliferation and oocyte recruitment in a species of lizard and to verify whether this metal acts as an endocrine disruptor. For this purpose, we treated adult females with cadmium or, alternatively, with estradiol, progesterone or follicle stimulatin...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of wild meats for rural people {{is well documented}} in tropical forests worldwide. However, the case of oceanic islands remains relatively poorly studied. We assess the contribution made by wild meats to the diets of rural inhabitants in the Island of São Tomé, characterize the relative {{importance of}} native and introduced fauna, and discuss the implications of wild meat consumption on rural livelihoods and on the conservation of the resident fauna. Using semistructured interviews, we assessed animal protein consumption in 10 communities (716 household-weeks), around the vicinity of the island's main protected area, Obô Natural Park. Fish and the introduced West African giant snail (Archachatina marginata) are the most important sources of protein for rural inhabitants, with <b>wild</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates</b> being consumed by {{only a small fraction of}} sampled households. Significantly higher amounts of wild snail and wild mammal meat are consumed in more remote areas with poorer families depending more on snails, and richer households on fruit bats or introduced mammals. Although eaten in relatively small numbers per household, consumption of wild birds is widespread, thus when extrapolated to the island's entire rural population, this practice is likely to be unsustainable, particularly for endemic pigeons that are also commercially hunted. Our results suggest that rural populations in São Tomé largely depend on protein from introduced wild species, with native and endemic fauna constituting less important sources. However, endemic birds and native fruit bats are extensively harvested for household consumption and constitute a commonly used resource that urgently needs to be regulated...|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of Asinara is {{a typical}} Mediterranean macchia, with lentisk, Euphorbia, tree heath (Erica arborea), Calicotome spinosa, Phillyrea angustifolia, Phoenician juniper and cistus. The flora consists of 678 species, 29 of which are endemic. Some, such as Centaurea horrida, Limonium laetum and Limonium acutifolium, are exclusive to northern Sardinia, while others are characteristic of the Sardinian - Corsican region. The fauna numbers around 80 <b>wild</b> species of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates,</b> including mouflon, <b>wild</b> boar, horses, Sardinian donkeys and the white Asinara donkey, which was introduced onto the island {{at the beginning of}} the 1800s, and probably abandoned when the inhabitants were moved to Stintino. Birds include the rare Audouin's gull, cormorants, peregrine falcons and the Barbary partridge. Asinara is the only place in Sardinia where the magpie is present.|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the {{traditional}} workhorse for reconstructing evolutionary events. The frequent use of mtDNA in such analyses derives from the apparent simplicity of its inheritance: maternal and lacking bi-parental recombination. However, in hybrid zones, the reproductive barriers are often not completely developed, resulting in the breakdown of male mitochondrial elimination mechanisms, leading to leakage of paternal mitochondria and transient heteroplasmy, resulting in an increased possibility of recombination. Despite the widespread occurrence of heteroplasmy {{and the presence of}} the molecular machinery necessary for recombination, we know of no documented example of recombination of mtDNA in any <b>terrestrial</b> <b>wild</b> <b>vertebrate</b> population. By sequencing the entire mitochondrial genome (16   761  bp), we present evidence for mitochondrial recombination in the hybrid zone of two mitochondrial haplotypes in the Australian frillneck lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii) ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{scientists}} {{are aware that}} humans share the same biological heritage as do all other organisms on the planet, the reliance of Homo sapiens on culture and cooperation has resulted in what {{can best be described}} as ‘‘a spectacular evolutionary anomaly. ’’ 1 : 11 The extra-somatic adaptations, technological domi-nance, and success of our species in colonizing every terrestrial habitat have no parallel. 2 Moreover, Homo sapiens accounts for about eight times as much bio-mass as do all other <b>terrestrial</b> <b>wild</b> <b>vertebrates</b> combined, 3 an amount equiva-lent to the biomass of all 14, 000 þ species of ants, 4 the most successful terres-trial invertebrates.

40|$|In <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates</b> such as {{birds and}} mammals, {{neurotrophin}} receptor expression is considered fundamental for the specification of distinct somatosensory neuron types where TrkA, TrkB and TrkC specify nociceptors, mechanoceptors and proprioceptors/mechanoceptors, respectively. In turn, Runx transcription factors promote neuronal fate specification by regulating neurotrophin receptor and sensory receptor expression where Runx 1 mediates TrkA+ nociceptor diversification while Runx 3 promotes a TrkC+ proprioceptive/mechanoceptive fate. Here, we report in zebrafish larvae that orthologs of the neurotrophin receptors {{in contrast to}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates</b> mark overlapping and distinct subsets of nociceptors suggesting that TrkA, TrkB and TrkC do not intrinsically promote nociceptor, mechanoceptor and proprioceptor/mechanoceptor neuronal fates, respectively. While we find that zebrafish Runx 3 regulates nociceptors in contrast to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates,</b> it shares a conserved regulatory mechanism found in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrate</b> proprioceptors/mechanoceptors in which it promotes TrkC expression and suppresses TrkB expression. We find that Cbfβ, which enhances Runx protein stability and affinity for DNA, serves as an obligate cofactor for Runx in neuronal fate determination. High levels of Runx can compensate {{for the loss of}} Cbfβ, indicating that in this context Cbfβ serves solely as a signal amplifier of Runx activity. Our data suggests an alteration/expansion of the neurotrophin receptor code of sensory neurons between larval teleost fish and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>vertebrates,</b> while the essential roles of Runx/Cbfβ in sensory neuron cell fate determination while also expanded are conserved...|$|R
