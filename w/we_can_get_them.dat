[...] The truce in that sector continued into Boxing Day; he commented about the Germans, [...] "The beggars simply disregard all our warnings to get down from off their parapet, so things are at a deadlock. [...] We can't shoot them in cold blood.... I cannot see how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to return to business." ...|$|E
2500|$|March 2012 – Shipping delays for {{the first}} batch were {{announced}} in March 2012, {{as the result of}} installation of an incorrect Ethernet port, but the Foundation expected that manufacturing quantities of future batches could be increased with little difficulty if required. [...] "We have ensured <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> [...] in large numbers and Premier Farnell and RS Components [...] have been fantastic at helping to source components," [...] Upton said. The first batch of 10,000 boards was manufactured in Taiwan and China.|$|E

6000|$|... "Neither is mine, but I guess <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> both," [...] {{answered}} Whopper. And {{then the}} lads ran forward {{to secure the}} two struggling deer, that were floundering furiously in the snow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now if {{you have}} to shoot, shoot high so as not to hit anybody on the other side," [...] was his warning. [...] "But maybe <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> without firing a shot," [...] he went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{we shoot}} {{we must make}} every shot tell," [...] said his father. [...] "And keep the {{cartridges}} where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> at <b>them</b> quickly. How many left, Dave?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry duty compels me to {{take all}} three, Clements, but I'll bear what you say in mind; perhaps <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to enter on board the Speedy. You know it--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get them on deck, Hawkins," [...] Frank said, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> {{down and}} stowed {{when we are}} under sail. Get the anchor short at once, the sail covers off and the {{mainsail}} up.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure, when <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> But they've {{been very}} scarce {{for a few}} years and we usually have to be content with {{elephants}} or buffaloes," [...] answered the creature, in a regretful tone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Famine--no!' said Nat Chapman. 'That only touches such as we, and the Lord only consarns {{himself with}} born gentlemen. It isn't to be {{supposed}} that a strange fiery lantern {{like that would}} be lighted up for folks with ten or a dozen shillings a week and their gristing, and a load o' thorn faggots when <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em.</b> If 'tis a token that he's getting hot about the ways of anybody in this parish, 'tis about my Lady Constantine's, since {{she is the only}} one of a figure worth such a hint.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} into their rear," [...] he said. [...] "We must creep along the sand until we reach those bushes up there, and then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> behind <b>them.</b> I'll go first, {{and you can}} follow me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Brooks: Yeah, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{help you}} <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> {{out of that}} bunker – with a hand grenade! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go you {{and meet}} them," [...] {{answered}} Baucis, [...] "while I make haste within doors, {{and see whether}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> anything for supper. A comfortable bowl of bread and milk would do wonders towards raising their spirits." ...|$|E
6000|$|We journeymen {{must take}} jobs when <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> When {{shall we go}} and look after this job?' 'When you will,' said the injured Blandois, 'as you please. What have I to do with it? What is it to me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} the skins if we can," [...] Mr. Goodenough said. [...] "The skins of the {{equatorial}} leopard are rare. If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> both {{they will make}} a fine group for you to stuff when you get back, Frank." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alec nodded. [...] "I see otter and fisher are quoted {{just the}} same, $15 for No. 1 prime. I {{think the two}} otter and the fisher we've got will grade that all right. Up here," [...] he continued, turning to the boys, [...] "marten pay us best because they bring us from $6 for No. 2 to $12 for large No. 1 prime and some years more than that. Lynx pay pretty nearly as well, when <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em.</b> The trouble is we don't <b>get</b> enough of <b>'em.</b> We <b>get</b> some foxes and some mink. The latter are rather down now, but some years they are high and pay right well. Last and least, but like the pennies that make the dollars, are the muskrats. They're {{bringing}} only thirty cents now, but I have seen 'em {{as high as a}} dollar.|$|R
6000|$|... "But nothin'. I'm tellin' {{you what}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> for <b>'em.</b> Ten a throw, just like that. We're the egg trust, Smoke an' me, an' don't you forget it. When we say ten a throw, ten a throw goes." [...] He mopped his {{plate with a}} biscuit. [...] "I could almost eat a couple more," [...] he sighed, then helped himself to the beans.|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{deals with}} dye plants and {{possibilities}} of their use. The first part contains classification of dye plants {{and history of}} their use. In the next part, there is a summary of dye plants and colors <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> from <b>them.</b> Methodology of coloring is also introduced. At the end, there are botanic parameters, environment needs and cultivation methods of eight selected dye plants. The thesis include database of dye plants in electronic form...|$|R

[...] "There are enough beasts right here to enable us to conquer the people of Oz, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to consent to join us. To do that, we must go among them and tell them our plans, so we must now decide on what shapes we had better assume while in the forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{figure it}} out," [...] said Snap, {{producing}} a note-book and a pencil. [...] "I suppose {{when it comes}} to such things as flour, sugar, salt, coffee and the like, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> from our homes. But there are other things that we will have to buy. For instance, we will need plenty of powder and shot, and we'll want to take medicines and plasters along, in case of accidents-----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Having {{left their}} luggage and his tools {{at the station}} they {{proceeded}} on foot up the familiar street, the holiday people all drifting in the same direction. Reaching the Fourways {{they were about to}} turn off to where accommodation was likely to be found when, looking at the clock and the hurrying crowd, Jude said: [...] "Let us go and see the procession, and never mind the lodgings just now? <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will lay}} in my paddle now, Luka. I must give all my {{attention}} to the sail. I expect they will give it up. They will think when they see me cease paddling that <b>we</b> know <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> away from <b>them</b> whenever we like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, men!" [...] says Captain Carton; [...] "I {{have to let}} you know, {{for your}} satisfaction: Firstly, that there are ten pirate-boats, {{strongly}} manned and armed, lying hidden up a creek yonder on the coast, under the overhanging branches of the dense trees. Secondly, that they will certainly come out this night when the moon rises, on a pillaging and murdering expedition, of which {{some part of the}} mainland is the object. Thirdly--don't cheer, men!--that we will give chace, and, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> at <b>them,</b> rid the world of them, please God!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they want}} to catch us, {{they can do it}} if they can paddle faster than <b>we</b> <b>can</b> sail," [...] I said. [...] "If we let them come close enough to {{discover}} their identity, and can then sail faster than they <b>can</b> paddle, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> away from <b>them</b> anyway, so we might as well wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{that is not}} all, lads. A {{party of}} their cavalry went to my chateau in my absence, burnt it down, and brought my wife here a prisoner. Now, it is {{absolutely}} certain that they will both of them be condemned, for they have a personal enemy on the committee of public safety, {{and they will be}} murdered, unless <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out; and I and my brother Leigh, whom you all know, have come for that purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} why," [...] the other said. [...] "Because he's cheap, {{and we get}} things from a fourth to a third less than <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> {{anywhere}} else. The quality is first rate, and he's absolutely honest. And, besides, he's a genius. The wretch has touch. The things have a style, a look, a hang! Really it's something wonderful. Sure it iss," [...] she ended in the tailor's accent, and then they both laughed and joined in a common sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{we shall}} {{go up the}} river about a hundred and twenty miles. There we shall buy horses cheaper than <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> here. We have got rifles and colts; they are things one can't very well do without in {{knocking}} about among the hills. I will go round the town, and I have no doubt I shall {{be able to pick}} you up what you want cheap. There are so many men get rubbed out {{one way or the other}} that such things are pretty often for sale." ...|$|E
5000|$|I had {{to decide}} whether we should risk the loss of maybe a dozen {{airplanes}} and crews just to get one man out. Finally I said to myself, Goddamn it, {{the one thing that}} keeps our boys motivated is the certain belief that if they go down, we will do absolutely everything <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out. If that is ever in doubt, morale would tumble. That was my major consideration. So I took it on myself. I didn't ask anybody for permission. I just said, [...] "Go do it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|How {{can work}} be made simpler, {{less prone to}} error, easier to learn? What role do {{diagrams}} and notations play in improving work output? What words do workers come to work already understanding, what do they misunderstand, and how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> using the same words to mean the same thing? ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContrary to {{what happens}} over prime fields of large characteristic, the main cost when {{counting}} the number of points of an elliptic curve E over GF(2 ^n) is the computation of isogenies of prime degree ℓ. The best method so far is due to Couveignes and needs asymptotically O(ℓ^ 3) field operations. We outline in this article some nice properties satisfied by these isogenies and show how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> from <b>them</b> a new algorithm that seems to perform better in practice than Couveignes's though of the same complexity. On a representative problem, we gain a speed-up of 5 for the whole computation...|$|R
6000|$|The {{old woman}} went then to {{where her husband}} was playing cards, but he would take no notice of her, and then {{she went to a}} woman of the {{neighbours}} and said: 'Is there no way <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> from one another?' and {{without waiting for an answer}} she said to some young men that were talking together: 'What good are you when you cannot make the best girl in the house come out and dance with you? And go now the whole of you,' she said, 'and see can you bring her away from the poet's talk.' But Oona would not listen to any of them, but only moved her hand as if to send them away. Then they called to Hanrahan and said he had best dance with the girl himself, or let her dance with one of them. When Hanrahan heard what they were saying he said: 'That is so, I will dance with her; there is no man in the house must dance with her but myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do about the men and stores?" [...] Willesden asked; [...] "you know that those two big boxes {{of the things we}} ordered at Maritzburg arrived yesterday." [...] "I think, Willesden, we will take Jack and the two Zulus, and leave Japhet and the Swazis here in charge of the stores, and blankets, and other things we leave behind us. Captain Brookfield will keep an eye on them for us. The farmer is going to ride back with us on one of the spare horses, and the three natives can ride the others. There is a {{hundredweight}} of biscuits in the sack that came with the boxes; each of us can take five pounds in his saddle-bag, a tin of cocoa and milk, and a pound or two of bacon. Jack can take a kettle and frying-pan, and the natives their blankets and twenty pounds of mealie flour for themselves and five times as much mealies for the horses. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> at the stores that were opened a few days ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|There is no {{possibility}} of explaining the system of life in this world, on any principle of conqueringly Divine benevolence. That piece of bold impiety, if it be so, I have always asserted in my well-considered books,--I considering it, on the contrary, the only really pious thing to say, namely, {{that the world is}} under a curse, which we may, if we will, gradually remove, by doing as we are bid, and believing what we are told; and when we are told, for instance, in the best book we have about our own old history, that [...] "unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them," [...] we are to accept it as the best thing to be done under the circumstances, and to wear, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> wolf skin, or cow skin, or beaver's, or ermine's; but not therefore to confuse God with the Hudson's Bay Company, nor to hunt foxes for their brushes instead of their skins, or think the poor little black tails of a Siberian weasel on a judge's shoulders may constitute him therefore a Minos in matters of retributive justice, or an Æacus in distributive, who can at once determine how many millions a Railroad Company are to make the public pay for not granting them their exclusive business by telegraph.|$|E
2500|$|English captain Mike Brearley {{attributed}} his team's {{success to}} {{its ability to}} get through the Australian batting order. [...] "The biggest problem is to break the opening pair.

5000|$|Piers Morgan, who exposed many of {{the sexual}} scandals {{as editor of the}} News of the World, wrote in his diary in {{reference}} to the Michael Brown story: [...] Major brought all these exposés on himself, with that ludicrous 'Back to Basics' speech at the last Tory conference ... It strikes me that probably every Tory MP is up to some sexual shenanigans, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>get</b> <b>them</b> all fired or there will be nobody left to run the country. Still, needs must. Brown's shenanigans will shift a few papers, get followed everywhere and ensure the NoW News of the World leads the news agenda again. We're on a roll and it feels fantastic.|$|R
