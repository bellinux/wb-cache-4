Kondō was adopted into another family at the age of 16. Kondō met Okita when Okita was sent to live in his household at the age of 9, when his family could no longer care for him. Kondō recognized and understood the young boy's discomfort and insecurity at living with a new family and welcomed him warmly. He served as Okita's mentor, older brother and at times took the role of father as Okita grew up. Okita is grateful to him and is extremely loyal to the point of vowing that he would commit seppuku should Kondō die. Kondō is fond of Kamiya (Sei) and recognizes her great ability {{as a member of the}} Shinsengumi. The character is based on the historical figure of Kondō Isami.|$|E

Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as Annie Oakley in the 1999 Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun. Among many glowing notices, critic Lloyd Rose of the Washington Post commented: [...] " [...] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, 'Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.' Partly this is because Merman's Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ...

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of local status, where workers compare their wage to the wage of other workers within the same firm. We assume a {{competitive}} labor market with unobservable effort, where firms condition wages on output as incentive for effort. If workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> status are also more productive, such status concerns generate an equilibrium with heterogenous firms where workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> and workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> status work together. Such firms provide workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> status with stronger incentives to exert effort, compared with workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care.</b> In addition, there will be homogenous firm who employ workers of the same type. The main result is that wage differences within heterogenous firms exceed the wage differences across homogenous firms. The difference from previous studies (e. g., Frank 1984) is that effort is elastically supplied and the payment for status is influenced by the relative supply of workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> and do not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> status. The positive correlation between status concerns and productivity is derived as part of the equilibrium, because workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> status signal their stronger motivation through investment in schooling.

Head writer Chris Chibnall, who wrote the episode, found that writing the second episode was hard, as there was a challenge to demonstrate how Torchwood works, and set the formula {{for the rest of the}} series. He wanted to write an episode that would centre on Gwen about her [...] "first day in hell", and show the audience that Torchwood is unlike any normal job, as one small mistake can have major ramifications on the city. The scene where Gwen accidentally opens the meteor was meant to [...] "extend the metaphor of breaking the photocopier on your first day at work". It is also set to show the separate dynamic between the team and Gwen. Series creator Russell T Davies stated that as the rest of the team are for the aliens, science, technology and mythology, Gwen is for [...] "the people"; she's the only person in the team <b>who</b> <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> what happens to Carys.

In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling [...] "like his fans, deserves better." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "capable" [...] McGregor and Gosling [...] "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before". The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: [...] "I had a kid {{come up to me}} on the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry.” Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage." [...] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that [...] "nobody <b>who</b> <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> great acting will want to miss his performance". Roger Ebert felt the performance [...] "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award. The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
