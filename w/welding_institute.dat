5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of the}} laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The <b>Welding</b> <b>Institute</b> (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The <b>Welding</b> <b>Institute</b> (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|E

25|$|Sheffield {{once had}} heavy {{industries}}, such as coal mining and the steel industry. Since {{the decline of}} such industries Sheffield has attracted tertiary and administrative businesses including more retail trade; Meadowhall being an example. However, while Sheffield's heavy industry has declined, the region has reinvented itself as a centre for specialist engineering. A cluster of hi-tech facilities including The <b>Welding</b> <b>Institute</b> and the Boeing partnered Advanced Materials Research Centre have all helped to raise the region's profile and to bring significant investment into Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The <b>Welding</b> <b>Institute</b> in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E

30|$|As it {{is already}} known, most of the high and very high {{strength}} steel grades derive their strength by quenching, while ductility is provided by subsequent tempering. In the recent study by Qiang et al. (2016), no brittle failure has been recorded for stress levels up to 1000  MPa, whilst necking characteristics have appeared for all specimens before failure. Especially for HSS (i.e. yield stress between 355 and 700  MPa), excellent toughness and weldability properties are acquired through rolling procedures at relatively low temperatures. Since 2006, general recommendations for the welding of VHSS are available by <b>welding</b> <b>institutes,</b> as it was identified by Pijpers (2011). On the other hand, during a fire event, the attained temperatures coincide with the tempering temperature, resulting in further decrease of the strength. The aforementioned issues are thoroughly addressed in the following section.|$|R
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new industrial process that was invented at The <b>Weld</b> <b>Institute</b> (TWI, United Kingdom) and patented in 1992 under research funded by in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Often quoted advantages of the process include good strength and ductility along with minimization of residual stress and distortion. Less well advertised are the beneficial effects of this solid state welding process in the field of occupational and environmental safety. It produces superior weld products in difficult to weld materials without producing any toxic fumes or solid waste that must be controlled as hazardous waste. In fact, it reduces noise pollution in the workspace as well. In the early days of FSW, most welding was performed on modified machine tools, in particular on milling machines with modified milling cutters. In spite of the obvious milling heritage of the process, the techniques and lessons learned from almost 250 years of successful metalworking with milling machines have not been applied in the field of modern Friction Stir Welding. The goal of the current research was to study currently successful FSW tools and parameterize the process {{in such a way that}} the design of new tools for new materials could be accelerated. Along the way, several successful new tooling designs were developed for current issues at the Marshall Space Flight Center with accompanying patent disclosure...|$|R

40|$|The Marshall Space Flight Center is {{developing}} and characterizing the {{friction stir welding}} process for the Space Shuttle and other space programs. This revolutionary process, invented and patented by The <b>Weld</b> <b>Institute</b> in England, offers tremendous advantages for joining aluminum for high performance applications. It is particularly suited for advanced aluminum-lithium alloys, such as 2195, the primary structural alloy used in the External Tank. The friction stir welding process joins metals with minimal heat input, resulting in high-strength joints with high ductility. It is a simple process to demonstrate using a common milling machine for sample parts, but relatively expensive to implement on large-scale hardware, due to {{the high cost of}} tooling needed to handle the high forging pressures characteristic of the process. Recent developments at the Marshall Space Flight Center have demonstrated friction stir welding on linear joints up to 5 meters (15 ft.), with material thickness ranging between 2. 5 mm and 16. 5 mm (0. 100 " to 0. 650 "). High efficiency weld joints have been produced in aluminum from the 2000, 5000, and 6000 series alloy systems. A "retractable pin tool" system was patented by MSFC that allows use of friction stir welding for joints with changing material thickness, and with less rigid tooling than previously considered. This presentation will describe the details of alloys welded to-date and technical advances under development at MSFC. These developments could have substantial benefit to industrial applications for welding aluminum...|$|R

30|$|High welding {{production}} {{is one of}} the desirable objectives to pursuit for more and more manufacturing enterprises and <b>welding</b> research <b>institutes.</b> Especially for the Tungsten Inert Gas welding, it is well-known for its high welding quality among the common welding methods due to the inert shielding gas and the non-melting tungsten electrode. Because of the low current allowable value to prevent tungsten electrode from melting and the phenomenon of arc divergence resulting from the low heat conductivity of argon shielding gas, however, low welding productivity has become its biggest shortcoming. It is believed that, improving the welding production by combination of high welding speed and deep weld depth can greatly broaden the application field of TIG welding.|$|R

The two important findings that result from this work are that for electroslag welding systems the heat-affected z one is relatively uniform and its size is not markedly affected by the process parameters; further-more, the percentage dilution is appreciably influenced by process parameters, such as the plate gap and the liquidus temperature. 1...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the high}} {{certification}} standards of offshore constructions and the already completed design phase of the monopiles, neither welding nor drilling into the piles was possible. This {{was not an issue}} for the installation of the sensors themselves since the application of miniature strain gauges and accelerometers by means of thin layer adhesives or spot welding is common practice. However, the fastening of a 40  kg data acquisition unit, several hundreds of meters of cable and steel profiles for the protection of sensors and cables to a pile wall that would be driven with energies of more than 1000  kJ per blow and accelerations of more than 1000  g (earth gravity) was a big challenge. In close cooperation, the Institute of Joining and <b>Welding</b> and the <b>Institute</b> for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering of Technische Universität Braunschweig in Germany developed a method by adhesive bonding of all required components for a scientific pile driving monitoring, which was successfully used during the installation of three large-scale monopiles.|$|R
