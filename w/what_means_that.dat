While {{he did not}} indulge in the delusion that the Union could be maintained or restored without a conflict of arms, he could indeed not foresee all the problems {{he would have to}} solve. He instinctively understood, however, by <b>what</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> conflict would have to be conducted by the government of a democracy. He knew that the impending war, whether great or small, would not be like a foreign war, exciting a united national enthusiasm, but a civil war, likely to fan to uncommon heat the animosities of party even in the localities controlled by the government; that this war would have to be carried on not by means of a ready-made machinery, ruled by an undisputed, absolute will, but by means to be furnished by the voluntary action of the people:--armies to be formed by voluntary enlistments; large sums of money to be raised by the people, through representatives, voluntarily taxing themselves; trust of extraordinary power to be voluntarily granted; and war measures, not seldom restricting the rights and liberties to which the citizen was accustomed, to be voluntarily accepted and submitted to by the people, or at least a large majority of them; and that this would have to be kept up not merely during a short period of enthusiastic excitement; but possibly through weary years of alternating success and disaster, hope and despondency. He knew that in order to steer this government by public opinion successfully through all the confusion created by the prejudices and doubts and differences of sentiment distracting the popular mind, and so to propitiate, inspire, mould, organize, unite, and guide the popular will that it might give forth all the means required for the performance of his great task, he would {{have to take into account}} all the influences strongly affecting the current of popular thought and feeling, and to direct while appearing to obey.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Ruthvel says he {{was giving}} him a severe lecture--on {{official}} morality, I suppose--when he heard a kind of subdued commotion at his back, and turning his head he saw, in his own words, something round and enormous, resembling a sixteen-hundred-weight sugar-hogshead wrapped in striped flannelette, up-ended {{in the middle of}} the large floor space in the office. He declares he was so taken aback that for quite an appreciable time he did not realise the thing was alive, and sat still wondering for what purpose and by <b>what</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> object had been transported in front of his desk. The archway from the ante-room was crowded with punkah-pullers, sweepers, police peons, the coxswain and crew of the harbour steam-launch, all craning their necks and almost climbing on each other's backs. Quite a riot. By that time the fellow had managed to tug and jerk his hat clear of his head, and advanced with slight bows at Ruthvel, who told me the sight was so discomposing that for some time he listened, quite unable to make out what that apparition wanted. It spoke in a voice harsh and lugubrious but intrepid, and little by little it dawned upon Archie that this was a development of the Patna case. He says that as soon as he understood who it was before him he felt quite unwell--Archie is so sympathetic and easily upset--but pulled himself together and shouted [...] "Stop! I can't listen to you. You must go to the Master Attendant. I can't possibly listen to you. Captain Elliot is the man you want to see. This way, this way." [...] He jumped up, ran round that long counter, pulled, shoved: the other let him, surprised but obedient at first, and only at the door of the private office some sort of animal instinct made him hang back and snort like a frightened bullock. [...] "Look here! what's up? Let go! Look here!" [...] Archie flung open the door without knocking. [...] "The master of the Patna, sir," [...] he shouts. [...] "Go in, captain." [...] He saw the old man lift his head from some writing so sharp that his nose-nippers fell off, banged the door to, and fled to his desk, where he had some papers waiting for his signature: but he says the row that burst out in there was so awful that he couldn't collect his senses sufficiently to remember the spelling of his own name. Archie's the most sensitive shipping-master in the two hemispheres. He declares he felt as though he had thrown a man to a hungry lion. No doubt the noise was great. I heard it down below, and I have every reason to believe it was heard clear across the Esplanade as far as the band-stand. Old father Elliot had a great stock of words and could shout--and didn't mind who he shouted at either. He would have shouted at the Viceroy himself. As he used to tell me: [...] "I am as high as I can get; my pension is safe. I've a few pounds laid by, and if they don't like my notions of duty I would just as soon go home as not. I am an old man, and I have always spoken my mind. All I care for now is to see my girls married before I die." [...] He was a little crazy on that point. His three daughters were awfully nice, though they resembled him amazingly, and on the mornings he woke up with a gloomy view of their matrimonial prospects the office would read it in his eye and tremble, because, they said, he was sure to have somebody for breakfast. However, that morning he did not eat the renegade, but, if I may be allowed to carry on the metaphor, chewed him up very small, so to speak, and--ah! ejected him again.|$|E

Why, what is become of the {{description}} of her first meeting with Don Whiskerandos--his gallant behaviour in the sea-fight--and the simile of the canary-bird? Tilb.

Thou counsel'st right; but 'tis no easy task For barefaced grief to wear a mask of joy. Enter. GOVERNOR.. Gov. How's this!--in tears?--O Tilburina, shame! Is this a time for maudling tenderness, And Cupid's baby woes?--Hast thou not heard That haughty Spain's pope-consecrated fleet Advances to our shores, while England's fate, Like a clipp'd guinea, trembles in the scale? Tilb. Then is the crisis of my fate at hand! I see the fleets approach--I see--" [...] Puff. Now, pray, gentlemen, mind. This {{is one of the most}} useful figures we tragedy writers have, by which a hero or heroine, in consideration of their being often obliged to overlook things that are on the stage, is allowed to hear and see a number of things that are not. Sneer. Yes; a kind of poetical second-sight! Puff. Yes.--Now then, madam. [...] "Tilb. I see their decks Are clear'd!--I see the signal made! The line is form'd!--a cable's length asunder! I see the frigates station'd in the rear; And now, I hear the thunder of the guns! I hear the victor's shouts--I also hear The vanquish'd groan!--and now 'tis smoke-and now I see the loose sails shiver in the wind! I see--I see--what soon you'll see-- Gov. Hold, daughter! peace! this love hath turn'd thy brain The Spanish fleet thou canst not see--because--It is not yet in sight!" [...] Dang. Egad, though, the governor seems to make no allowance for this poetical figure you talk of. Puff. No, a plain matter-of-fact man;--that's his character. [...] "Tilb. But will you then refuse his offer? Gov. I must--I will--I can--I ought--I do. Tilb. Think what a noble price. Gov. No more--you urge in vain. Tilb. His liberty is all he asks." [...] Sneer. All who asks, Mr. Puff? Who is-- Puff. Egad, sir, I can't tell! Here has been such cutting and slashing, I don't know where they have got to myself. Tilb. Indeed, sir, you will find it will connect very well. [...] "--And your reward secure." [...] Puff. Oh, if they hadn't been so devilish free with their cutting here, you would have found that Don Whiskerandos has been tampering for his liberty, and has persuaded Tilburina to make this proposal to her father. And now, pray observe the conciseness with which the argument is conducted. Egad, the pro and con goes as smart as hits in a fencing match. It is indeed a sort of small-sword-logic, which we have borrowed from the French. [...] "Tilb. A retreat in Spain! Gov. Outlawry here! Tilb. Your daughter's prayer! Gov. Your father's oath! Tilb. My lover! Gov. My country! Tilb. Tilburina! Gov. England! Tilb. A title! Gov. Honour! Tilb. A pension! Gov. Conscience! Tilb. A thousand pounds! Gov. Ha! thou hast touch'd me nearly!" [...] Puff. There you see-she threw in Tilburina. Quick, parry Carte with England! Ha! thrust in tierce a title!--parried by honour. Ha! a pension over the arm!--put by by conscience. Then flankonade with a thousand pounds--and a palpable hit, egad! [...] "Tilb. Canst thou--Reject the suppliant, and the daughter too? Gov. No more; I would not hear thee plead in vain: The father softens--but the governor Is fix'd! [Exit.]" [...] Dang. Ay, that antithesis of persons is a most established figure. [...] "Tilb. 'Tis well,--hence then, fond hopes,--fond passion hence; Duty, behold I am all over thine-- Whisk. [Without.] Where is my love--my-- Tilb. Ha! Enter DON FEROLO WHISKERANDOS. Whisk. My beauteous enemy!--" [...] Puff. O dear, ma'am, you must start a great deal more than that! Consider, you had just determined in favour of duty--when, in a moment, the sound of his voice revives your passion-- overthrows your resolution--destroys your obedience. If you don't express all that in your start, you do nothing at all. Tilb. Well, we'll try again. Dang. Speaking from within has always a fine effect. Sneer. Very. [...] "Whisk. My conquering Tilburina! How! is't thus We meet? why are thy looks averse? <b>what</b> <b>means</b> <b>That</b> falling tear--that frown of boding woe? Ha! now indeed I am a prisoner! Yes, now I feel the galling weight of these Disgraceful chains--which, cruel Tilburina! Thy doting captive gloried in before.--But thou art false, and Whiskerandos is undone! Tilb. O no! how little dost thou know thy Tilburina! Whisk. Art thou then true?--Begone cares, doubts, and fears, I make you all a present to the winds; And if the winds reject you--try the waves." [...] Puff. The wind, you know, is the established receiver of all stolen sighs, and cast-off griefs and apprehensions. [...] "Tilb. Yet must we part!--stern duty seals our doom Though here I call yon conscious clouds to witness, Could I pursue the bias of my soul, All friends, all right of parents, I'd disclaim, And thou, my Whiskerandos, shouldst be father And mother, brother, cousin, uncle, aunt, And friend to me! Whisk. Oh, matchless excellence! and must we part? Well, if--we must--we must--and in that case The less is said the better." [...] Puff. Heyday! here's a cut!--What, are all the mutual protestations out? Tilb. Now, pray, sir, don't interrupt us just here: you ruin our feelings. Puff. Your feelings!--but, zounds, my feelings, ma'am! Sneer. No, pray don't interrupt them. [...] "Whisk. One last embrace. Tilb. Now,--farewell, for ever. Whisk. For ever! Tilb. Ay, for ever! [Going.]" [...] Puff. 'Sdeath and fury!--Gad's life!--sir! madam! if you go out without the parting look, you might as well dance out. Here, here! Con. But pray, sir, how am I to get off here? Puff. You! pshaw! what the devil signifies how you get off! edge away at the top, or where you will--[Pushes the CONFIDANT off.] Now, ma'am, you see-- Tilb. We understand you, sir. [...] "Ay, for ever. Both. Oh! [Turning back, and exeunt.--Scene closes.]" [...] Dang. Oh, charming! Puff. Hey!--'tis pretty well, I believe: you see I don't attempt to strike out anything new--but I take it I improve on the established modes. Sneer. You do, indeed! But pray is not Queen Elizabeth to appear? Puff. No, not once--but she is to be talked of for ever; so that, egad, you'll think a hundred times that she is on the point of coming in. Sneer. Hang it, I think it's a pity to keep her in the green-room all the night. Puff. O no, that always has a fine effect--it keeps up expectation. Dang. But are we not to have a battle? Puff. Yes, yes, you will have a battle at last: but, egad, it's not to be by land, but by sea--and that is the only quite new thing in the piece. Dang. What, Drake at the Armada, hey? Puff. Yes, i'faith--fire-ships and all; then we shall end with the procession. Hey, that will do, I think?, Sneer. No doubt on't. Puff. Come, we must not lose time; so now for the under-plot. Sneer. What the plague, have you another plot? Puff. O Lord, yes; ever while you live have two plots to your tragedy. The grand point in managing them is only to let your under-plot have as little connection with your main-plot as possible.--I flatter myself nothing can be more distinct than mine; for as in my chief plot the characters are all great people, I have laid my under-plot in low life, and as the former is to end in deep distress, I make the other end as happy as a farce.--Now, Mr. Hopkins, as soon as you please. Enter UNDER PROMPTER. Under Promp. Sir, the carpenter says it is impossible you can go to the park scene yet. Puff. The park scene! no! I mean the description scene here, in the wood. Under Promp. Sir, the performers have cut it out. Puff. Cut it out! Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. What! the whole account of Queen Elizabeth? Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. And the description of her horse and side-saddle? Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. So, so; this is very fine indeed!--Mr. Hopkins, how the plague could you suffer this? Mr. Hop. [Within.] Sir, indeed the pruning-knife-- Puff. The pruning-knife--zounds!--the axe! Why, here has been such lopping and topping, I shan't have the bare trunk of my play left presently!--Very well, sir--the performers must do as they please; but, upon my soul, I'll print it every word. Sneer. That I would, indeed. Puff. Very well, sir; then we must go on.--Zounds! I would not have parted with the description of the horse!--Well, sir, go on.--Sir, it was one of the finest and most laboured things.-- Very well, sir; let them go on.--There you had him and his accoutrements, from the bit to the crupper.--Very well, sir; we must go to the park scene. Under Promp. Sir, there is the point: the carpenters say, that unless there is some business put in here before the drop, they sha'n't have time to clear away the fort, or sink Gravesend and the river. Puff. So! this is a pretty dilemma, truly!--Gentlemen, you must excuse me--these fellows will never be ready, unless I go and look after them myself. Sneer. O dear, sir, these little things will happen. Puff. To cut out this scene!--but I'll print it--egad, I'll print it every word! [Exeunt.] ...|$|E

50|$|Alternaria {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} the organisms Alternaria brassicae, Alternaria brassicicola and Alternaria japonica. Their English names are black spot, pod spot, gray leaf spot, dark leaf spot or Alternaria blight. The symptoms {{can be seen on}} all aboveground plant parts as dark spots. The infected plants are shrivelled and smaller than normal. Alternaria diseases infect almost all brassica plants, the most important hosts are oilseed brassicas. The fungus is a facultative parasite, <b>what</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> it can survive on living hosts as well as on dead plant tissue. Infected plant debris is in most circumstances the primary source of inoculum. The spores can be dispersed by wind to host plants in the field or to neighbouring brassica crops. This is why cross infections often occur in areas where different brassica crops are cultivated in close proximity. The disease spreads especially fast when the weather is wet and the plants have reached maturity.Alternaria brassicae is well adapted to temperate regions while Alternaria brassicicola occurs primarily in warmer parts of the world. Temperature requirement for Alternaria japonica is intermediate.There exist some wild accessions of Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis with resistance to Alternaria brassicae but not on commercial cultivars. These resistances should be included to breeding programmes. Alternaria epicemics are best avoided by management practices like at least 3 years non-host crops between brassica crops, incorporation of plant debris into the soil to accelerate decomposition and usage of disease-free seeds.|$|E
