5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan <b>Welsh</b> produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and <b>Welsh</b> wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical <b>Welsh</b> foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, <b>Welsh</b> organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern <b>Welsh</b> characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding {{his other}} actions, Peckham's {{relations}} with the king were generally good, and Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in Wales. In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the <b>Welsh</b> and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was a hopeless mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of the <b>Welsh</b> who were resisting Edward, not unsurprising given Peckham's views of the <b>Welsh.</b> Peckham visited the <b>Welsh</b> dioceses {{as part of his}} tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised the <b>Welsh</b> clergy for their unchaste lives, conspicuous consumption, and heavy drinking. He also found the <b>Welsh</b> clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised the <b>Welsh</b> people as a whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding the <b>Welsh</b> to be lazy and idle.|$|E

5|$|Pigs {{were the}} primary meat eaten by early <b>Welsh</b> folk, which could be {{preserved}} easily by salting. By 1700, {{there were a number}} of different <b>Welsh</b> breeds of pig, with long snouts and thin backs, generally light coloured, but some were dark or spotted. Today, pigs in Wales are either farmed intensively, using the white <b>Welsh</b> pig or Landrace pig, or extensively, where Saddleback pig, <b>Welsh</b> pig or crossbreeds are farmed.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Welsh</b> Pony and Cob is a {{group of}} four closelyrelated horse breeds {{including}} both pony and cob types, which originated in Wales in the United Kingdom. The four sections within the breed society for the <b>Welsh</b> breeds are primarily distinguished by height, and also by variations in type: the smallest <b>Welsh</b> Mountain Pony (Section A); the slightly taller but refined <b>Welsh</b> Pony of riding type (Section B) popular as a children's show mount; the small but stocky <b>Welsh</b> Pony of Cob Type (Section C), popular for riding and competitive driving; and the tallest, the <b>Welsh</b> Cob (Section D), which can be ridden by adults. <b>Welsh</b> ponies and cobs in all sections are known for their good temperament, hardiness, and free-moving gaits.|$|E

5|$|The predilection of the <b>Welsh</b> for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of <b>Welsh</b> rarebit, or <b>Welsh</b> rabbit, {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread. The cheese {{would need to be}} a harder one, such as chedder or similar. Referred to as <b>Welsh</b> rabbit as early as 1725, the name is not similar to the <b>Welsh</b> term caws pobi. <b>Welsh</b> folk rarely ate rabbit due to the cost and as land owners would not allow rabbit hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the <b>Welsh.</b> The name evolved from rabbit to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from <b>Welsh</b> cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E
