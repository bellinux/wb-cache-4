5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E
5|$|Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy) {{goes to the}} Springwood Diner to {{meet with}} her ex-boyfriend, Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz), who falls asleep {{at the table and}} meets a man covered in burn scars, wearing a clawed glove on his hand. The burned man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat as his friend, {{waitress}} Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara), looks on with Kris. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> her dreams. Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in her blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having dreams about the same man: Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley).|$|E

25|$|The {{similarity}} of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series Doctor Who {{has also been}} noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations {{of the real world}} and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> reality.|$|E
25|$|Experiments with P. h. humanus (body lice) {{emphasize}} the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with {{six or more}} males <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> a few days, having laid very few eggs. Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement. The female laid only one egg after mating, and her entire body was tinged with red—a condition attributed to rupture of the alimentary canal during the sexual act. Old females frequently die following, if not during, intercourse.|$|E

25|$|N. bombycis kills 100% of {{silkworms}} hatched from infected eggs. This {{disease can}} be carried over from worms to moths, then eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food the silkworms eat. If silkworms get this disease in their worm stage, no visible symptoms occur. However, mother moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of worms hatching from the diseased eggs <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> their worm stage. To prevent this disease, it is extremely important to rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's body fluid under a microscope.|$|E

However, it is noted by R. Daneel Olivaw in Foundation and Earth {{that it would take}} several more centuries to bring Galaxia about.|$|E

Faced {{with the fact that he}} is cheating on Katherine, Vincent begins being drawn into a Nightmare realm where himself and other men become trapped and must climb towers of interlinked blocks while outrunning terrifying monsters; if they fail, they <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> the real world.

500|$|Double-strand breaks, {{in which}} both strands in the double helix are severed, are {{particularly}} hazardous to the cell because they can lead to genome rearrangements. PVN Acharya noted that double-strand breaks and a [...] "cross-linkage joining both strands {{at the same point}} is irreparable because neither strand can then serve as a template for repair. The cell <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> the next mitosis or in some rare instances, mutate." [...] Three mechanisms exist to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs): non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and homologous recombination. In an in vitro system, MMEJ occurred in mammalian cells at the levels of 10–20% of HR when both HR and NHEJ mechanisms were also available.|$|E
500|$|In Norse mythology, a valkyrie (from Old Norse valkyrja [...] "chooser of the slain") {{is one of}} a host {{of female}} figures who decide who <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> battle.

There, when the einherjar are not {{preparing}} for the events of Ragnarök, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens, and sometimes connected to swans.|$|E

Wollaston joked in his review about Richard Dawkins's cameo, and compared his anti-theological mannerisms to the Daleks. Gareth McLean described the end of the episode as a [...] "genuine, jaw-dropping, outta-nowhere cliffhanger". [...] He commended the production team for successfully suppressing information about the regeneration in an industry often stifled by leaks. Stephen Brook of The Guardians media blog Organgrinder, thought the episode was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] and [...] "genuinely scary and exciting". [...] He theorised about the questionable regeneration: whether it was genuine and, if so, who would portray the next incarnation of the Doctor; and which companion <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Journey's End".|$|E

Tripathi explained that {{the final version of the}} book was longer than he had expected it to be, and consisted of 53chapters, making it twice as long as the other books. During an interview with The Times of India, the author discussed some of the important scenarios being presented in the book. He explained that since Shiva is a mortal in his series, he would have a fitting epilogue in the book, with many of the loose ends of the plot finally being deciphered. Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. [...] "Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing someone we love? The Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go quietly into the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good.
