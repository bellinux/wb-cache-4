40|$|Abstract — Feedforward {{control is}} {{reliable}} for rejecting fast and dynamic voltage disturbances in the grid. Mainly this scheme is implemented based on phase voltages of the <b>wye</b> <b>connected</b> configuration. Under unbalanced and distorted grid-condition, the online conversion of line-to-line values into the phase values is unworkable. In order to exploit full advantages of feedforward controller, an appropriate modulator is needed. In this paper the feedforward of grid line-to-line voltages {{is used in}} lieu of phase voltages. The introduced feedforward method is implemented with implicit zero-sequence discontinuous pulse width modulation (IZDPWM) technique that is compatible for grid-connected inverters. Regardless the grid topology, IZDPWM exactly copies the distorting harmonics of the grid voltage. Hence, a sinusoidal current is injected to the grid. Moreover, for measuring the grid line-to-line voltages two sensors are required; hence overall system cost is reduced and control system reliability is increased.

40|$|Abstract [...] The use {{of power}} {{converters}} {{is very important in}} maximizing the power transfer from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or even a hydrogen-based fuel cell to the utility grid. A LCL filter is often used to interconnect an inverter to the utility grid in order to filter the harmonics produced by the inverter. Even though there is an extensive amount of literature available describing LCL filters, there has been a gap in providing a systematic design methodology. Furthermore, there has been a lack of a state-space mathematical modeling approach that considers practical cases of delta and <b>wye</b> <b>connected</b> capacitors showing their effects on possible grounding alternatives. This paper describes a design methodology of a LCL filter for grid-interconnected inverters along with a comprehensive study of how to mitigate harmonics.

40|$|A five pole, one slot per phase, full pitch, twelve coil, <b>wye</b> <b>connected,</b> {{three phase}} linear {{induction}} pump {{has been designed}} for operation with 400 C sodium. The design incorporated a graded winding {{in order to reduce}} the net pulsating component of the magnetic flux density wave and a pump duct using copper side bars. The small laboratory-size pump was designed in two steps: stator design and winding design. First, the stator and core dimensions were established on the basis of maximum pressure development and maximum power at the design flow and slip. Maximum pressure output was a requirement of the intended pump application. The condition of maximum power output was used in order to provide a good pump efficiency. Second, the parameters for the induction pump equivalent circuit were determined for several winding methods. The winding method which offered 3920 ampere turns per phase (equivalent to a flow rate of 4. 88 gpm, a pressure of 60 psi, a line voltage of 250 volts, and a wave length of 21. 2 cm as calculated in the first step) was selected. The theoretical performance characteristics of the flat induction pump were computed using the equivalent circuit parameters for a winding with 60 turns per coil. The measurement of developed pressure (0 to 42. 13 psi), sodium flow rate (0 to 9. 93 gpm), and power input (0 to 103. 9 watts) after installation of the pump in an operational sodium circulating loop provided an experimental determination of the pump performance characteristic. In addition, the effect of pump duct temperature on sodium flow rate and a differential transformer system used to locate the sodium level in manometer columns were briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} common PWM switching strategies implemented with permanent magnet AC machine drives. This study also considers online parameter estimation techniques {{that can be}} implemented with such drives. Finally a new simulation model of the drive and tools for modelling the specific machine under test are presented. Initially the research focuses on comparisons of the performance parameters which {{are influenced by the}} differences in current control strategies. Bang-Bang, PI and SVPWM controllers are the three alternative switching strategies which are discussed and then evaluated. The results highlight the impact the strategy selection has on the phase current quality and hence the power output of the motor under test. PI and SVPWM are both strategies that utilise a fixed switching frequency and as a result exhibit larger power losses in the inverter stage of the drive system. Bang-Bang control is seen to exhibit greater power losses in terms of output power in the motor stage {{as a direct result of}} the poor quality phase current waveform generated. The experiments conducted allow for a thorough comparison of each strategy outlined. Techniques used to estimate the average phase voltage commanded under operation are presented in this thesis. Techniques for estimating phase voltage when operating the SVPWM technique on a <b>wye</b> <b>connected</b> machine is described, as are techniques for use with both PI and SVPWM control of a delta connected machine. This is based on published techniques that have been implemented for the PI <b>wye</b> <b>connected</b> case. The voltage estimation techniques are then used to estimate the flux linkage waveforms of the machine under test. Validation for this technique is sought through comparison of measurements with predictions made using commercially available finite element analysis tools; the measurements and predictions are shown to correlate to a significant degree. In search of validating the techniques against measurements made with calibrated measurement equipment – known to be reliable – the validation path results in subsequent techniques to be developed which estimate the average torque output of the machine under test. Torque measurements made using commercially available torque transducer equipment are compared with online estimates allowing for a validation of the voltage estimations. Using a new simulation environment – Portunus from Adapted Solutions – a modern permanent magnetic synchronous machine drive system has been modelled. Making use of a PMSM component developed by Dr Mircea Popescu of Motor Design Ltd, a model of the drive system is constructed by the addition of customised components of the controller technology and other drive system hardware. This includes a custom developed C++ model of the SPEED laboratory FCIV technology which is used to control the drive system used in this research. Use of standard Portunus logic components is also presented which effectively models the interface of the gate drive signals with the voltage inverter components of the drive system. Finally the thesis details the results of simulations modelling the comparison of the control strategies of chapter 2 and also the online estimation techniques of chapter 3. The simulation model’s inclusion of a dedicated machine component allows for effective tailoring of the system model on a per machine basis; this allows for a comparison of the results presented in the initial testing with the simulated equivalents. Such a comparison is also made between the results of the testing of the online torque estimation techniques and the simulated response of the estimation techniques. Strong correlation is shown between the results of the testing carried out in the early stages of the research using the drive system outlined in chapters 2 and 3 with the simulation results obtained using the model outlined in chapters 4 and 5...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{study of}} high {{frequency}} electromagnetic transient phenomena is performed. Models of various components needed for simulations of high frequency transients, such as for transformers, cables and breakers are developed. Measurements were performed in Chalmers research laboratory {{as well as at}} ABB Corporate Research in Västerås, Sweden for the purpose of parameter estimation of models and for verification of simulations. Critical cases where the voltage surges of the magnitude and/or rise time above basic lightning impulse voltage level appear, are identified. Also, some transient protection schemes are analyzed and the performance of different transient mitigation devices is studied. Furthermore, the voltage distribution along the winding during very fast transients is studied in order to estimate turn-to-turn voltages and the critical voltage envelope. In the work it was found that simulations of the high frequency transients are in a very good agreement with the measurements obtained in the laboratory. Simulations predicted accurately critical surges with the highest magnitude and matched with good accuracy surge waveforms recorded during the measurements. The accuracy of the rise times is within 10 %, while the magnitudes during the critical cases are within a 5 % margin. During the testing and simulations, surges which exceed the basic lightning impulse voltage level of dry-type transformers specified by IEEE standards, both in magnitude and rise time are observed at the transformers even when surge arresters are used to protect the transformers. Furthermore, obtained voltage surges exceeded the proposed critical voltage envelope. It is shown that the most critical voltage strikes are obtained with dry-type transformers, where the rise time is five to ten times shorter compared to oil-insulated transformer with the same rating. It was confirmed both in simulations and measurements that the use of additional transient protections devices such as surge capacitors and RC protections, decreased the magnitude of surges to be below the critical level. The analysis of the voltage during very fast transients showed that the rise time of the transients directly influences the magnitude of the turn-to-turn voltages. Furthermore, during the breaker closing transient, turn-to-turn voltages, measured in delta connected dry-type transformers, were 2. 5 times higher than the voltages obtained during the same transient with a <b>wye</b> <b>connected</b> dry-type transformer, or during the stress with a 4. 4 p. u. lightning impulse voltage...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} detailed modelling of {{the induction}} machine {{with the main}} objective being accurate fault current prediction. The thesis focus mainly on mains connected induction machines and the response due to severe disturbances in the supply voltage, such as three-phase short-circuit faults. Both the squirrel-cage induction machine {{as well as the}} doubly-fed induction machine are treated. In order to accomplish accurate results, dynamic parameters of the induction machine is needed, and accordingly, extensive measurement series has been accomplished in order to identify these. A large number of locked-rotor tests and no-load tests with varying voltages and frequencies have been performed to find out the varying nature of the parameters due to skin effect and saturation. Regarding saturation, the effect of leakage flux saturation has been investigated. To incorporate for the skin effect and the effect of leakage flux path saturation in the calculations, a conventional dynamic mathematical description of the induction machine 5 th order Park model) is modified, which makes it applicable for various operating conditions. The fault-current prediction of the detailed model is compared with the prediction of the conventional fifth order model and a dynamically equivalent three-phase model, and also with measurements of symmetrical and asymmetrical short circuit faults, starts and locked-rotor tests. The different models presented are also discussed with respect to wind power as the main application. The proposed model shows excellent agreement, and also indicates the essentiality to incorporate for the saturation of the leakage flux path and the skin effect as the response due to severe faults is to be determined and if a high accuracy result is the objective. Incorporation of the main flux saturation, is of little importance for the short-circuit fault currents. Regarding the selection of a two- or three phase model, the most appropriate model as well as the more simple model, is generally the two axis model. The disadvantage is the inability to account for a zero sequence component. The possible choice of using a three phase model is however only an issue if the generator is <b>wye</b> <b>connected</b> and if the neutral point of the generator is connected. Wind turbine generators are mainly connected in delta which imply no neutral point and if they are connected in wye, the neural point is however not connected. In the thesis the fault current determination for the doubly-fed induction generator system and the fixed speed system are treated. The fault current determination for the full power converter system is however not dealt with since this type of system have full control of the fault currents and can control these to a desired level...|$|E

The extension to Ipswich included a 718 ft tunnel under Washington Street in Salem - one of the nation's first railroad tunnels.On June 16, 1846, the stockholders authorized the sale of $450,000 of new stock to fund various branch lines plus new depots at Salem and Lynn. Gridley James Fox Bryant designed a massive stone structure, one of his first major commissions. Eastern president D.A. Neal requested the style after being inspired by a similar station - possibly English, possibly the 1844-built Leipzig Thüringer Bahnhof - during a European trip. The Washington Street side of the new station had two towers, resembling those of a medieval castle, flanking a granite archway which spanned three tracks. The wooden trainshed was constructed to the south, partially on piers over the South River (which was not filled until the 1880s). A massive sea wall was built to protect the station from flooding. The station opened on December 1, 1847. In 1851, Nathaniel Hawthorne described the station in The House of the Seven Gables: ...they now found themselves passing beneath the arched entrance of a large structure of gray stone. Within, there was a spacious breadth, and an airy height from floor to roof, now partially filled with smoke and steam, which eddied voluminously upward, and formed a mimic cloud-region over their heads.

The South Reading Branch was built to compete with the Eastern for Boston-Salem traffic; it connected to the rival Boston and Maine Railroad at South Reading (Wakefield Junction). The Salem & Lowell and the South Reading Branch shared a station at the north end of the tunnel rather than using the Eastern's station, even after the Eastern acquired the South Reading Branch in 1851.|$|R

This practice ended in the early 1970s due to the need for faster turnarounds and the new locomotive's inability to negotiate a tight curve on the north (Bailey) <b>wye.</b> The <b>connecting</b> track lay idle for two decades before finally being removed in the mid-1990s. Today the trains circle the park in a clockwise direction, covering roughly 1.8 mi and taking 15-20 minutes on each circuit.|$|R
