5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Swedish mycologist and botanist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus gemmatus in 1838. It {{was transferred to}} the genus Amanita in 1866 by the French statistician Louis Bertillon. The species has been transferred to several genera in its history, resulting in a number of synonyms, including Amanita muscaria var. gemmata (1886, Lucien Quélet), Amanitopsis gemmata (1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo), Amanitaria gemmata (1940, Jean-Edouard Gilbert), and Venenarius gemmatus (1948, William Murrill). Amanita authority Rodham E. Tulloss considers A.amici (published by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1891) to be synonymous with A.gemmata, as the macroscopic characteristics of the former fall <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of the range expected for the latter.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started on}} the {{extension}} in 1914. To allow for {{the extension of the}} line south from Times Square, the entire western wall of the subway between 43rd Street and 44th Street was removed, all while service continued uninterrupted. The line was mostly built in an open-cut, excluding the segments <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of Battery Park, the widened portions of Varick Street, and the new Varick and Seventh Avenue Extensions. Filled in ground was found south of Varick Street along Greenwich Street, which approximately marked the old shore line of the Hudson River {{during the time of the}} American Revolution. Many buildings had to be underpinned during the construction of the line, especially those on the lower sections through Greenwich Street.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E

5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement in decision making, <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The park is {{the most}} visited during {{the spring and summer}} months, when it is open between 8:00 and 19:00 (7:00pm) local time. In autumn and winter, it closes at 17:00 (5:00pm). Admission at the {{entrance}} must be paid. Camping, lighting fires, or setting up overnight shelters are strictly forbidden <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of the national park {{in order to protect the}} surrounding ecosystem. The park can be reached from the city center of Kuşadası via several dolmuş (share taxis) that regularly shuttle the route to the closest town of Güzelçamlı. Recently, there have also been ferry boat services operating back and forth between Kuşadası and Güzelçamlı, in turn providing easier access to the park for visitors. Each year, around 700,000 foreign and domestic tourists visit the park.|$|E
5|$|The old Jewish Quarter (Mellah) is {{situated}} in the kasbah area of the city's medina, east of Place des Ferblantiers. It was created in 1558 by the Saadians at {{the site where the}} sultan's stables were previously located. At the time, the Jewish community consisted of {{a large portion of the}} city's bankers, jewelers, metalworkers, tailors and sugar traders. During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of the Mellah; all growth was consequently contained <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured as a mainly residential zone renamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area smaller than its historic limits and has an almost entirely Muslim population. The Alzama Synagogue, built around a central courtyard, is located in the Mellah. The Jewish cemetery here is the largest of its kind in Morocco. Characterized by white-washed tombs and sandy graves, the cemetery is located within the Medina on land adjacent to the Mellah.|$|E
