500|$|Known {{for having}} refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become {{increasingly}} interested in progressive rock sounds {{by the time}} he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. [...] "The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' [...] "attitude" [...] and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen referred to Rundgren as [...] "an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll", but also said the band was [...] "kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's... Todd was cool and he was a producer." [...] Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: [...] "It wasn't a long list. Todd was in New York and seemed like he could handle the pace." [...] Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that [...] "the only person who can produce a New York record is someone <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York".|$|E

Arguing that Miller should be confined to her home and could forego Internet access and cellphone use, Miller's lawyers suggested that [...] "impairing her unrestricted ability to do her job as an investigative journalist ... would present the strictest form of coercion to her".
