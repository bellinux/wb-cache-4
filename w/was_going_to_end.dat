5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie looked like it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E

Later in the competition, Essien scored a late {{winner in the}} quarter-final second leg against Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium to send Chelsea through to the semi-finals with a 2–1 victory on the night and a 3–2 win on aggregate. It was his first match back in the team after several weeks out with a knee injury. Essien also scored a stunning late equaliser at home against Arsenal on 10 December 2006, as the match <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> Chelsea's long unbeaten run.|$|E

He decided to split it into two books, and thus the Inheritance Trilogy became the Inheritance Cycle. Paolini revealed this decision in an October 2007 press release, and stated that his development as a writer since Eragon is what caused the book to become so complex.|$|E

[...] She was pleased with the emphasis on Jim and the way he [...] "wonderfully bookended the conflicting emotions Michael inspires." [...] West also believed that the [...] "writers did a great job of creating the sense of crisis that resulted in the Scranton branch instead absorbing Stamford (I never trusted that Josh guy) even though fans of the original knew it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> up that way."

A week later, shortly after his father died, Icke and his wife, Linda Atherton, along with their daughter and Deborah Shaw, held a press conference to announce that Icke was a son of the Godhead. He told reporters the world <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in 1997.

Los Angeles would become an island, New Zealand would disappear, and the cliffs of Kent would be under water by Christmas.|$|E

[...] Before Crisis Core began development, the staff had planned to create a PlayStation Portable port of , but soon changed their minds to create a game that focused on Zack, whose fate was already predetermined; fans knew how the game <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b> Throughout the game, the staff decided to use a blue sky in cutscenes to represent Zack, while other features in such scenes are meant to symbolize his connections. A number of Zack's actions from the game were also designed so as to augment the similarities that Aerith finds between him and Cloud in Final Fantasy VII. Zack and Cloud's connection was also meant to be expanded upon near the game's ending, {{with both of them}} planning to flee to Midgar. However, due to limitations in the console's hardware, these scenes could not be implemented, and instead, they decided to focus on Zack's role as a warrior.|$|E

500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{published}} {{a review of the}} show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card. He considered the main event [...] "underwhelming" [...] due to the [...] "audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another Joe-Booker bout that everyone knew <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> with some sort of gimmicky finish" [...] and that it was [...] "not memorable" [...] but that it would [...] "generate talk about Jarrett." [...] He gave the bout 2 stars. [...] "That was an epic match", said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match. However, he felt the bout had a [...] "silly pin-and-count-'em stipulation" [...] and that the [...] "all-too-real neck injury angle, followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles's win." [...] Caldwell felt the match made Styles look [...] "like a star when he won, then he came across like a punk attacking Angle, then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out" [...] but that he had a [...] "memorable, star-making victory over Angle." [...] He disapproved of Styles being [...] "used a means to the end of explaining Sting's purpose-driven TNA life." [...] Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars. As for the Street Fight, {{he said it was a}} [...] "fun brawl for the audience" [...] and gave it 2 1/2 stars. Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had [...] "good heat" [...] that [...] "over-rode the stream of outside interference, referee incompetence, and overall over-booking" [...] and that it was [...] "refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match." [...] He gave the match 3 stars. The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars and he said it would have been [...] "great" [...] if it had avoided involving [...] "outside interference." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{return in}} 1947 was lower, but in 1948, with the Somerset batting seeming ever more {{dependent}} on him for runs, he responded {{with all of the}} four centuries scored by the team in the summer, {{and one of them was}} his own highest score and the highest innings made to that stage by a Somerset batsman: 310 against Sussex at Eastbourne. The previous Somerset record had been 292, set by the late Victorian era amateur Lionel Palairet. Gimblett told his biographer David Foot, on the tapes that form the backbone of the biography, that he had said on the pitch at Eastbourne to Sussex player James Langridge: [...] "Well, that's got rid of one amateur's name in our county's record books." [...] Gimblett went on to say that a collection had been proposed to mark the feat, but that Somerset's secretary had been dismissive of the idea.

The filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work and changed it to Full Metal Jacket after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. After the first draft was completed, Kubrick phoned in his orders, and Hasford and Herr mailed their submissions to him. Kubrick read and edited them, and then the team repeated the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much he had contributed to the screenplay, {{which led to a}} dispute over the final credits.

2500|$|Itagaki {{suggested}} to Puyi {{that in a}} few years time Manchukuo might become a monarchy and stated that Manchuria was just the beginning, as Japan had ambitions to take all of China; the obvious implication was that Puyi would become the Great Qing Emperor again. When Puyi objected to Itagaki's plans, he was told that he was in no position to negotiate as Itagaki had no interest in his opinions on these issues. Unlike Doihara, who was always very polite and constantly stroked Puyi's ego, Itagaki was brutally rude and brusque, addressing Puyi like he was barking out orders to a particularly dim-witted common soldier. Puyi's chief adviser Zheng Xiaoxu had been promised by Itagaki that he would be the Manchukuo prime minister, an offer that appealed to his vanity sufficiently enough that he persuaded Puyi to accept the Japanese terms, telling him that Manchukuo would soon become a monarchy and history would repeat itself, as Puyi would conquer the rest of China from his Manchurian base just as the Qing did in 1644. In Japanese propaganda, Puyi was always celebrated both in traditionalist terms as a Confucian [...] "Sage King" [...] out to restore virtue and as a revolutionary who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the oppression of the common people by a program of wholesale modernization.|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular {{terrestrial}} broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had {{asked him how he}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", he thought about it and asked himself: [...] "What could I say that would wrap this all up? And then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's do this thing one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E
