25|$|The Cleveland <b>Wire</b> <b>Mill</b> Company, {{established}} in February 1867. Its works were built {{adjacent to the}} neighborhood's western border where Wire Avenue met the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad tracks. The only mill {{of its kind in}} northern Ohio when it was built, it proved so successful that it doubled in size within a year. This mill was also the largest {{of its kind in the}} country, and capable of manufacturing an extremely wide range of product. Cleveland Rolling Mill purchased the works of the Cleveland <b>Wire</b> <b>Mill</b> Company in 1868 or 1869. Cleveland Rolling Mill expanded the plant beginning in 1896, adding a rod mill with two small blast furnaces and a continuous rod mill with one small blast furnace.|$|E

25|$|Wicker Tilts and wheel {{was really}} two works, a {{grinding}} wheel {{known to have}} been working in 1581, and a tilt forge built in the 1740s. A second tilt was added near Lady's Bridge by 1752. The grinding wheel, which supplied 36 troughs, was replaced by a <b>wire</b> <b>mill</b> in the 1870s, and was still using water power in 1895, by which time the tilts were using steam power. The weir was close to Lady's Bridge, and the head goit flowed through one of the arches of the bridge. It is thought that there are several goits in culverts near Blonk Street, but their exact extent is unknown. The culverted Porter Brook joins the River Sheaf, which is also culverted, below Sheffield Railway Station, and the combined flows join the Don between Lady's Bridge and Blonk Street bridge.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, work resumed again. Although Roebling {{operated}} his own <b>wire</b> <b>mill</b> at Trenton, New Jersey, the bridge company purchased one million pounds of wire from Richard Johnson at Manchester, England for the cables that would span {{the width of the}} river. Roebling had used Johnson's wire for one of his other bridges. He preferred it over wire made in the United States because it was of better quality and greater tensile strength. Anchorages on both shores were constructed of limestone base and a freestone finish. Eleven ton iron anchors were embedded in each block, securing cables with wrought iron chain links of Roebling's patent. These links resembled almost exactly the ones his son, Washington Roebling, would use {{in the construction of the}} Brooklyn Bridge. The Civil War depleted the work force on the project, hindering speed and efficiency until its end.|$|E
500|$|After a fire {{destroyed}} the Southern Wire Company, Gates gambled {{on the idea}} that William Edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that Southern Wire would manufacture in Edenborn's now idle barbed wire plant. The new company was known as St. Louis <b>Wire</b> <b>Mill</b> Company. They continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales. [...] Washburn-Moen went back into court, this time in Des Moines, Iowa, where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by Baker was an infringement of Washburn-Moen's patents. By this time, Gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using Washburn-Moen's methods; the ruling in favor of Washburn-Moen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the U. S. Federal Court in Des Moines. [...] Washburn-Moen continued to falter; Isaac Ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with Gates. Ellwood and another key figure with Washburn-Moen, John Lambert, now accepted offers from Gates. The barbed wire legal issues ended with Washburn-Moen selling their patent rights to Gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers.|$|E

A picture of the mill c.1911 can be seen [...] The mill was not sold and again offered for auction in 1912, again without success. A third attempt at auction in 1918 saw the mill being bought by a Major Crum. He sold it to a Miss Wilkins who had the building converted to residential use in 1920. The mill was purchased by the Women's Farm and Garden Union in 1922 and by 1929 was the <b>Wire</b> <b>Mill</b> Tea Gardens. By 1933 it was the <b>Wire</b> <b>Mill</b> Fishing Club and in 1948 the <b>Wire</b> <b>Mill</b> Hotel and Fishing Club. By 1962 the property {{was known as the}} Wiremill Lakeside Hotel, Country and Fishing Club. Over the next decade the Country Club grew in popularity, leading to complaints and the local council refused to renew the clubs music and dancing licence. In 1986 the mill was again sold, and although damaged by a fire during renovations reopened as a restaurant in September of that year. The mill was sold again in 1996 and 2000 and is now a pub.

2500|$|Cleveland Rolling Mill {{expanded}} {{its presence in}} 1868 {{with the construction of}} the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. A [...] stationary blast furnace and four [...] rolling open hearth furnaces were also built. A boiler plate mill, sheet metal mill, and <b>wire</b> <b>mill</b> were in operation by 1870.

The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. A second open hearth furnace was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878.

2500|$|Woodcock Forge is {{believed}} to have been built by Jack Dancy of Turners Hill. Hedgecourt Mill is thought to have been remodelled by him about the same time. The pond at Hedgecourt acted as a storage for the Woodcock forge. The tilt hammer was operated by an overshot waterwheel. Another overshot waterwheel worked bellows. In 1574, John Thorpe of Hedgecourt was working the forge in connection with the furnace at Myllwood. in 1586 Thorpe bought property from William Swanne Sr in the Woodcock Forge area. From 1598 to 1606 the rent was paid by Thomas Thorpe, son of John and in 1629 the forge was leased by John Gage to Richard Thorpe, the son of Thomas. His son, also Richard, held the forge until 1651, when it was forfeit in lieu of a debt. Thorpe's interest in the forge was sold to Simon Everenden of Cliffe near Lewes. In the 1650s the forge was in the occupation of John Newnham. In 1664, the forge was lease by Jeremy Johnson Jr of Charlwood. In 1672, woodland next to the pond was referred to as [...] "Hammerwood" [...] also known as [...] "Wire Wood" [...] thus indicating a drawing mill. John Newnham died in 1707, and his wife died in 1719, but the forge was known as [...] "Mr Johnson's Forge" [...] in 1717. At that time the output from the forge was some [...] per annum. [...] By 1729 the forge was in the occupation of Thomas Stanford, who was converting sows from Heathfield furnace at Woodcock Forge. Stanford does not seem to have had any connections with the Wealden iron industry after 1738. In 1742 Samuel Baker was in occupation, followed by Edward Raby and Alexander Master in 1758. They were supplying the Board of Ordnance with several gauges of bar iron, staff iron and rolled plate. Raby & Master were bankrupt in 1764. Edward Raby died in 1771, and the forge was taken over by his son Alexander until 1774, when the Government forced him to give up Woodcock furnace in a wrangle over the size of his moulds. Joseph Wright and Thomas Pickett took the business, but it is thought that the Hammer Mill ceased to be used c.1787. In 1800, the name <b>Wire</b> <b>Mill</b> is first used.|$|E
