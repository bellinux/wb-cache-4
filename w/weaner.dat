40|$|It {{was aimed}} {{in this work}} to {{evaluate}} the productivity and efficiency of beef cows submitted to <b>weaning</b> of their calves at 76 days (early <b>weaning)</b> or at 148 days (<b>weaning</b> at conventional age) after calving during three consecutive years. It was evaluated pregnancy rate, birth and <b>weaning,</b> gain weight of the calves and cows at conventional <b>weaning,</b> weight at conventional <b>weaning</b> of calves and cows, production of <b>weaned</b> calves per cow and calf production index. Pregnancy rate in the herd submitted to early <b>weaning</b> (86. 34 %) was {{higher than in the}} conventional <b>weaning</b> (55. 5 %). Early <b>weaning</b> cows showed higher birth and <b>weaning</b> rates when compared to conventional <b>weaning</b> (83. 6 and 83. 6 % vs. 47. 5 and 44. 5 %, respectively) besides a higher production of calves (183 vs. 114). Early <b>weaning</b> cows produced 60. 5 % more calves than the conventional <b>weaning</b> cows. Conventional <b>weaning</b> calves gained more weight from birth to <b>weaning</b> (97. 9 vs. 83. 4 kg, respectively). Early <b>weaning</b> cows had more weight gain from calving to <b>weaning</b> (42. 5 vs. 18. 7 kg, respectively), and regarded to calf production index, they were more efficient (efficiency of the herds). At the average of the three years, the early <b>weaning</b> of the calves allows higher calving rates and <b>weaning</b> to the cows, in addition to a higher index of calf kilogram index produced in relation to <b>weaning</b> at conventional age...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{variables}} for early prediction of successful <b>weaning</b> in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients during pressure support ventilation <b>weaning.</b> DESIGN: Thirteen COPD patients were prospectively studied to compare the respiratory pattern (inspiratory time, expiratory time, total breath cycle duration, tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation), the respiratory drive (airway occlusion pressure at 0. 1 sec, tidal volume/inspiratory time), and blood gases after 30 mins of pressure support <b>weaning.</b> SETTING: The study was performed in the 20 -bed General Critical Care Unit of the Rome "La Sapienza" University Hospital. PATIENTS: We evaluated 13 consecutive COPD patients fulfilling the standard <b>weaning</b> criteria (including clinical status, blood gases, forced vital capacity, maximum inspiratory pressure, and spontaneous respiratory rate after a 30 -min T-piece trial) in which we compared respiratory pattern, respiratory drive, and blood gases after 30 mins of pressure support <b>weaning.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 30 mins of pressure support ventilation <b>weaning</b> (pressure support level 20 cm H 2 O), we measured respiratory pattern (airway pressure and airflow tracing), airway occlusion pressure at 0. 1 sec (occluding the inspiratory line during expiration with a rubber balloon), tidal volume/inspiratory time, maximal inspiratory pressure, and blood gases. According to the result of the <b>weaning</b> trial, the patients were divided into two groups (not <b>weaned</b> and <b>weaned),</b> and the statistical difference between the evaluated variables was analyzed in <b>weaned</b> and not <b>weaned</b> groups. We did not observe a significant difference in breathing pattern data and arterial blood gases between <b>weaned</b> and not <b>weaned</b> patients. By contrast, airway occlusion pressure at 0. 1 sec and maximum inspiratory pressure measured after 30 mins of <b>weaning</b> trial appeared significantly (p less than. 001) different in patients in whom the <b>weaning</b> trial succeeded or failed. Considering maximum inspiratory pressure, we could not separate <b>weaned</b> from not <b>weaned</b> patients, while all patients showing values of airway occlusion pressure at 0. 1 sec less than 4. 5 cm H 2 O were easily <b>weaned.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that conventional <b>weaning</b> criteria are often inadequate in predicting successful <b>weaning</b> of COPD patients, while airway occlusion pressure at 0. 1 sec during the first phase of pressure support ventilation <b>weaning</b> can represent a good <b>weaning</b> predictor...|$|R

40|$|Although the <b>weaning</b> {{classification}} {{based on}} the difficulty and duration of the <b>weaning</b> process has been evaluated in the different type of intensive care units (ICUs), {{little is known about}} clinical outcomes and validity among the three groups in medical ICU. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical relevance of <b>weaning</b> classification and its association with hospital mortality in a medical ICU with a protocol-based <b>weaning</b> program. All consecutive patients admitted to the medical ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 24 hours were prospectively registered and screened for <b>weaning</b> readiness by a standardized <b>weaning</b> program between July 2010 and June 2013. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared across <b>weaning</b> classifications. During the study period, a total of 680 patients were <b>weaned</b> according to the standardized <b>weaning</b> protocol. Of these, 457 (67 %) were classified as simple <b>weaning,</b> 136 (20 %) as difficult <b>weaning,</b> and 87 (13 %) as prolonged <b>weaning.</b> Ventilator-free days within 28 days decreased significantly from simple to difficult to prolonged <b>weaning</b> groups (P < 0. 001, test for trends). In addition, reintubation within 48 hours after extubation (P < 0. 001) and need for tracheostomy during the <b>weaning</b> process (P < 0. 001) increased significantly across <b>weaning</b> groups. Finally, ICU (P < 0. 001), post-ICU (P = 0. 001), and hospital (P < 0. 001) mortalities significantly increased across <b>weaning</b> groups. In a multiple logistic regression model, prolonged <b>weaning</b> but not difficult <b>weaning</b> was still independently associated with ICU (adjusted OR 8. 265, 95 % CI 3. 484 - 19. 605, P < 0. 001), and post-ICU (adjusted OR 3. 180, 95 % CI 1. 349 - 7. 497, P = 0. 005), and hospital (adjusted OR 5. 528, 95 % CI 2. 801 - 10. 910, P < 0. 001) mortalities.

METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in a 12 -bed general ICU at a university hospital. Weaning data were collected from 68 adult patients on MV and recorded in terms of ventilator-shifts. One ventilator-shift was defined as an 8 -hour nursing shift for one MV patient. RESULTS: Of the 2000 ventilator-shifts analysed, 572 ventilator-shifts were available for <b>weaning.</b> We found that only 46 % of the ventilator shifts available for <b>weaning</b> were actually used for <b>weaning.</b> While physician prescription of <b>weaning</b> was associated with increased <b>weaning</b> activity (p < 0. 001), a large amount (22 %) of <b>weaning</b> took place without physician prescription.

A total of 31 male and female lambs were evaluated, being 19 lambs born in April/May 2001 and 12 lambs born in February/March 2002. Lambs were distributed in the following treatments at weaning: 1) <b>weaning</b> age = T 1 : <b>weaned</b> at 60 days; T 2 : <b>weaned</b> at 75 days; T 3 : <b>weaned</b> at 90 days, and 2) <b>weaning</b> weight = T 1 : <b>weaned</b> with 9 to 10. 4 kg weigth; T 2 : <b>weaned</b> with 10. 5 to 12. 4 kg weight and T 3 : <b>weaned</b> with above 12. 5 kg weight. The PWG was recorded through successive weightings done every fourteen days from <b>weaning</b> to 180 days of age. Data were analysed through a statistical model that included age and weight at <b>weaning,</b> sex and year of birth as fixed effects. Lambs <b>weaned</b> with 60, 75 and 90 days of age showed non-significant differences (P> 0. 05) on PWG. However, WW had a significant influence (P< 0. 05) on lamb weight.

40|$|Behaviour {{problems}} {{are common in}} companion felines, and problematic behaviour {{may be a sign}} of chronic stress.

To study the effects of early <b>weaning</b> (< 12 weeks) on behaviour, a large data set (N = 5726, 40 breeds) was collected from home-living domestic cats through a questionnaire survey. The results show that <b>weaning</b> before 8 weeks of age increases the risk for aggression, but not fearful behaviour. Moreover, cats <b>weaned</b> after 14 weeks of age have a lower probability for aggression towards strangers than early <b>weaned</b> cats and a lower probability for stereotypic behaviour (excessive grooming) than cats <b>weaned</b> at 12 weeks.
