25|$|In these lectures, Newman denounced various anti-Catholic utterances. These {{included}} {{those of}} the Maria Monk, the allegation of cells under his own Oratory on Hagley Road, Birmingham and those of Giacinto Achilli. Newman emphasises the importance of responding to Achilli: For how, Brothers of the Oratory, can <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> believe a man like this , in what he says about persons and facts, and conversations, and events, when he is of the stamp of Maria Monk, of Jeffreys, and of Teodore, and of others who have had their hour, and then been dropped by the indignation or the shame of mankind.|$|E

[...] In June he entered a controversy when Peter Martyr, another refugee who had taken the equivalent Regius Professor position at Oxford University, debated with Catholic colleagues {{over the issue of}} the Lord's Supper. Martyr asked Bucer for his support, but Bucer did not totally agree with Martyr's position and thought that exposure of differences would not assist the cause of reform. Unwilling to see the eucharist conflict repeat itself in England, he told Martyr he did not take sides, Catholic, Lutheran, or Zwinglian. He said, [...] "We must aspire with the utmost zeal to edify as many people as <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> can in faith and in the love of Christ—and to offend no one." ...|$|E

500|$|However, the {{campaign}} was unsettling to others—particularly the intelligentsia. A 57-year-old lawyer told The Washington Post, [...] "I saw the beatings of the teachers by the Red Guards. It was horrible…Young people may not recognize it. But for us who lived through it, how can <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> sing?" [...] An academic quoted in The Daily Telegraph described the mandatory campaign as akin to being [...] "drowned in a Red sea." [...] In September 2009, a mid-level official in the city committed suicide after being pressured to organize his work unit {{to participate in the}} red songs campaign. The official, Xie Dajun, reportedly disagreed with {{the campaign}}, which evoked painful memories of the Cultural Revolution. Bo’s critics and opponents derisively referred to him as [...] "little Mao," [...] with some expressing concern about the resemblance of the red culture campaign to the Cultural Revolution.|$|E
500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind of}} relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false.

500|$|The vocals of {{the album}} were {{recorded}} at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks. As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push {{what we had to}} the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as clean as <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase." ...|$|E

By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, {{if you really want to}} get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|Emmy Award winner Terence Winter, who {{had served}} as {{executive}} producer and writer on the critically acclaimed HBO series The Sopranos, was hired to adapt the novel Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City on June 4, 2008. Winter had been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before. It was {{for this reason that}} he decided to focus his adaption of the novel on the Prohibition era section. On September 1, 2009, it was announced that Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese would direct the pilot. It would be {{the first time he had}} directed an episode of television since an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories in 1986. The production would be very ambitious, with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television. [...] "I kept thinking 'This is pointless. How can <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> afford a boardwalk, or an empire? says creator Terence Winter. [...] "We can't call it 'Boardwalk Empire' and not see a boardwalk." [...] The production would eventually build a [...] boardwalk in an empty lot in Brooklyn, New York at the cost of five million dollars. Despite a reported budget of up to $50 million, the pilot's final budget came in at $18 million.|$|E
500|$|On November 6, 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 (2012) {{was passed}} by initiative, thereby legalizing the {{recreational}} use of cannabis. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper signed two bills on May 28, 2013 that made Colorado the world's first fully regulated recreational cannabis market for adults. Hickenlooper explained to the media: [...] "Certainly, this industry will create jobs. Whether it’s good for the brand of our state is still up in the air. But the voters passed Amendment 64 by a clear majority. That’s why we’re going to implement it as effectively as <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> can." [...] In its independent analysis, the Colorado Center on Law & Policy found that the state could expect a to see [...] "$60 million in total combined savings and additional revenue for Colorado’s budget with a potential for this number to double after 2017." [...] On September 9, 2013, the Colorado Department of Revenue adopted final regulations for recreational marijuana establishments, implementing the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code (HB 13-1317). On September 16, 2013, the Denver City Council adopted an ordinance for retail marijuana establishments. The first stores officially opened on January 1, 2014. The state prepared for an influx of tourists with extra police officers posted in Denver. Safety fears led to officials seeking to limit use of the drug in popular ski resorts.|$|E

Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway expressed concern for stricter laws to prevent similar incidents, stating [...] "None {{of this would have}} occurred had she stayed clothed.

2500|$|In mid-2002, LucasArts {{announced}} Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels for Windows and, for {{the first}} time in the series, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game was to be an action-adventure, with more emphasis on action and fighting than adventure, because the designers wanted the game to feel more physical than the first. Hell on Wheels would have been set in El Nada, Ben's [...] "old stomping ground", whose roads have been mysteriously destroyed. Ben believes that one of the new gangs introduced in the game, the Hound Dogs, are behind this but soon discovers a more sinister and murderous plot. Together with Father Torque and Maureen, he would have thwarted the unnamed villain's plan and protected [...] "the freedom of the open road". Sean Clark was named the project lead of Hell on Wheels and the development progressed smoothly until late 2003, when it was abruptly canceled. Just months prior to that, at E3 2003, a playable demo was shown and a teaser trailer was released by LucasArts. Simon Jeffery (then president of LucasArts) said that [...] "We do not want to disappoint the many fans of Full Throttle, and hope everyone can understand how committed we are to delivering the best-quality gaming experience that <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> can" [...] in the official press release. Critics cited poor graphics compared to other 3D action adventures of the time and Tim Schafer's lack of involvement in the project as possible reasons for its cancellation. Additionally, Roy Conrad, the original voice actor for Ben, died in 2002.|$|E
