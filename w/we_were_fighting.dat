500|$|In his {{capacity}} as an academic, Tsakalotos {{served as a}} member of the executive committee of the Hellenic Federation of University Teachers' Associations (POSDEP). In the mid-2000s, Tsakalotos led his students in a several months-long protest against proposed reforms to the Greek education system. Thanos Tsouknidas, an accountant that knew Tsakalotos at the time, said: [...] "He was there, involved in the struggle. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> together." [...] His active role in the teachers' union brought him popularity, and according to a former student, his classes were often packed.|$|E
2500|$|... "I began {{shooting}} as a {{sport or}} hobby after America entered the war, in 1942. At that time I {{was living in}} Gainesville, Georgia. … The National Guard was offering a course in marksmanship to civilians who wished to take part. I thought that every American man should become proficient with firearms since <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for our existence; so I registered for the course" [...] (Florida Wildlife, 37).|$|E
2500|$|However, their {{relationship}} got strained again in March 2008. [...] It {{was reported that}} Francesa and Russo were considering ending their radio show. [...] Russo admitted that {{from the end of}} March through the beginning of May, [...] "Mike and I were having a lot of issues. If you're a listener, I don't have to tell you [...] [...] [...] <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> like cats and dogs. The tolerance level of each other, Mike to me, me to Mike, was low." [...] But Russo insisted {{their relationship}} had improved. [...] Francesa agreed that this was among the worst of their [...] "four or five" [...] fights over the years.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{unlikely}} any Native American recognized Custer {{during or after}} the battle. Michno summarizes: [...] "Shave Elk said 'We did not suspect that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> Custer and did not recognize him either alive or dead.' Wooden Leg said no one could recognize any enemy during the fight, for they were too far away. The Cheyennes {{did not even know}} a man named Custer was in the fight until weeks later. Antelope said none knew of Custer being at the fight until they later learned of it at the agencies. Thomas Marquis learned from his interviews that no Indian knew Custer was at the Little Bighorn fight until months later. Many Cheyennes were not even aware that other members of the Custer family had been in the fight until 1922, when, Marquis said, he himself first informed them of that fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{returning}} to New York City in January 1937, Schneider {{claimed he was}} never paid in full. Spain claimed that they were paid in full, and were not owed any money. Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said [...] "This was a mess... and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where we did not know who <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> and why, and you can say that we are damn glad to be back." [...] The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never forsworn allegiance to America.|$|E

60|$|It is {{too much}} to suppose that the combatants will ever drop the obvious old bone. But it is not too much to imagine that some men might {{acknowledge}} the bone to be merely a pretext, and hollow casus belli. If we really could know what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for, if we if we could deeply believe in what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for, then the struggle might have dignity, beauty, satisfaction for us. If it were a profound struggle for something that was coming to life in us, a struggle that we were convinced would bring us to a new freedom, a new life, then it would be a creative activity, a creative activity in which death is a climax in the progression towards new being. And this is tragedy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't throw {{cold water}} upon my compromise," [...] Mr. Foley begged. [...] "We {{are hoping for}} great things. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> the class against which you have written so splendidly; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> the bourgeoisie, tooth and nail. One thing is {{certainly}} written--that if Maraton here stands by my side {{for the next seven}} years, Labour will have thrown off one, at least, of the shackles that bind her.

6000|$|Colonel Woodburn frowned a little, {{and passed}} over the joke. [...] "I think Mr. Lindau is right. Such {{exhibitions}} were common to both sides, though if you gentlemen will pardon me for saying so, I think they were less frequent on ours. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> more immediately for existence. We were fewer than you were, and we knew it; we felt more intensely that if each were not for all, then none was for any." ...|$|E
60|$|Yesterday, and {{for many}} days and nights previously, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> somewhere; always there was cannonading, with {{occasional}} keen rattlings of musketry, mingled with cheers, our own or the enemy's, we seldom knew, attesting some temporary advantage. This morning at daybreak the enemy was gone. We have moved forward across his earthworks, across which we have so often vainly attempted to move before, through the debris of his abandoned camps, among the graves of his fallen, into the woods beyond.|$|E

6000|$|She {{could not}} speak, but in mute appeal pointed first {{to him and}} then to d'Aguilar, who stood near, remembering {{as she did so}} her vision in the house at Holborn, which was thus terribly fulfilled. Holding to a rope, d'Aguilar drew near to her and spoke into her ear. [...] "Lady," [...] he said, [...] "this is no deed of mine. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> a fair fight, for he had boarded the ship when the mast fell and killed him. Blame me not for his death, but seek comfort from God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{gratification}} to me, my dear Buck, {{to be able}} to {{say that}} we anticipated your suggestions precisely. We went as early as possible to reconnoitre the nine entrances. Unfortunately, while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> each other in the dark, like a lot of drunken navvies, Mr. Wayne's friends were working very hard indeed. Three hundred yards from Pump Street, at every one of those entrances, there is a barricade nearly as high as the houses. They were finishing the last, in Pembridge Road, when we arrived. Our mistakes," [...] he cried bitterly, and flung his cigarette on the ground. [...] "It is not we who learn from them." ...|$|E

60|$|Now a new wind <b>is</b> getting up. <b>We</b> call it Labour versus Capitalism. <b>We</b> say it <b>is</b> a mere {{material}} struggle, a money-grabbing affair. But this is {{only one}} aspect of it. In so far as men are merely mechanical, the struggle is one which, though it may bring disaster and death to millions, is no more than accident, an accidental collision of forces. But in so far as men are men, the situation is tragic. It is not really the bone <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> for. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> to have somebody's head off. The conflict is in pure, passional antagonism, turning upon the poles of belief. Majesty was only hors d'oevres to this tragic repast.|$|R
