50|$|In early 20th century {{automobiles}} {{prior to}} the introduction of power steering, the effect of a flat or blowout on one of the front wheels tended to pull the steering mechanism toward the side with the flat tire. The use of a <b>worm</b> <b>screw</b> reduced this effect. Further worm drive development led to recirculating ball bearings to reduce frictional forces, which transmitted some steering force to the wheel. This aids vehicle control and reduces wear that could cause difficulties in steering precisely.|$|E

The column, having square cross-section with side length 0. 5 m, was 3. 7 m heigh. It was subjected to an axial compression of 1700 kN using two externally post-tensioned 47 mm-diameter Dywidag bars.

Correspondingly, a 15 % degradation of the base-joint resistance was attained and the drift reached 5. 25 %. At this deformation level, the dowel action involving the connection rebars was significant, leading to a maximum slip within the joint of about 7 mm.

Axial profile of worm is a curve which is the intersection of worm surface and the plane passing through its axis, and normal profile is perpendicular in a selected point to worm profile. This normal profile in more accurately way characterizes the shape of the worm profile, therefore, the calculation of the shape of the tool cutting edge is designed with a tool set to the normal plane. Based on the analyses, the new computation equations were obtained, flowchart compiled and, according to a given regulation, the computer aided calculation of the coordinates can be implemented...|$|E
40|$|Modern railway {{vehicles}} are requested to achieve improved performances together with higher safety for passengers and crew: {{for this reason}} recent European and National Standards claim for more demanding tests for type approval. In this contest, the initial phase of type approval’s tests became very important {{in order to achieve}} good results before the on line tests. This paper deals with the set up of test bench to perform type approval tests on carbody, used for the new Italian double deck coaches. This bench is composed by two longitudinal beams headed by two crossbeams: at one side hydraulic actuators are placed in order to apply the requested load. With a simple procedures is available to perform compression test on bumpers and also compression or traction test on a coupler a <b>worm</b> <b>screw</b> it is possible to apply both traction or compression loads to the carbody. At the other side there is only a reaction crossbeam, rigidly connected with the longitudinal member. Moreover a truss structure should be mounted at one end in order to apply the load at higher levels. The reaction is, however, provided at the other side at bumper level, as stated in the European norm EN 12663. So, this test bench allowed to perform traction and compression tests, at bumpers level or in higher position (window level or roof). The driving/trailer and the trailer double deck coaches tested with this new test bench will compose the 60 new 5 coaches “Vivalto” regional train of Trenitalia developed from October 2005, with the main following characteristics: - Number of seats/places: 90 / 126 - Maximum speed: 160 Km/h The first phase regarded compression tests at bumper level. The European Standard (EN 12663) provide for 2 x 1000 kN symmetric load applied on the head beam of the carbody in the bumper zone and for 2000 kN on the coupler area. Moreover diagonal compression tests are requested: this test is performed applying a force up to 500 kN at one bumper, reacting at the opposite side. The test bench is able, with small adjustments, to provide traction test on the couplers, applying up to 1500 kN, as suggested in the EN 12663 Standard for different types of automatic coupler. In addition, the EN standard provides for compression tests at different height, applying high level loads (up to 400 kN) up to the roof level, by means of an auxiliary truss structure between test bench and carbody. Thusthese compression tests were performed in the third phase: 400 kN 150 mm over the bumpers, 300 kN at window level and 300 kN at the roof level. In the full paper the results of the test listed before will be summarised giving the evidence of the great correspondence with the results of FEM calculations...|$|E

The <b>Screw</b> <b>worm</b> is a fly larva that enters an open wound of a live animal and eats the flesh of the animal from within, leading to a gruesome death.

Other steps to battle the outbreak included injecting deer with anti-parasitic drugs, fencing off healthy sections of the population and tracking a portion of deer with radio-collars. The pest was declared as eradicated in April 2017. The outbreak killed 135 deer, roughly an eighth of the herd.|$|R

The parasite is a large yellowy red-headed fly with a metallic sheen. The female can lay up to 300 eggs in four minutes in any tiny wound. Within an hour these eggs have developed into screw-shaped larvae which then enlarge the wound and attract more egg-laying females. Serious myiatic debilitation, and even death, follow if the infection is not treated. The fly has no natural enemies other than cold and thus thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. It can travel large distances, but is also transported by larvae-ridden animals. In the Americas, the <b>screw</b> <b>worm</b> fly causes hundreds of millions of dollars' damage and, although it can be eradicated by releasing males sterilized by exposure to gamma rays, this solution may be too expensive and impracticable for application in vast areas of the African continent.

40|$|Over 500 cattle of all {{age groups}} on 2 farms in Zimbabwe were immunised against theileriosis using the "infection and treatment" method and disease {{prevalence}} and their productivity assessed {{during a period of}} 18 months. The immunising stock, Theileria parva (Boleni) was isolated in Zimbabwe. None of the immunised cattle suffered from theileriosis upon natural exposure whereas 22 unimmunised cattle died of theileriosis and a further 48 required treatment for theileriosis. In the first year, some immunised cattle were maintained with minimal threshold dipping (once or twice during the rainy season). During periods of very high tick challenge of 100 to 1, 000 Rhipicephalus appendiculatus per animal from January to March, a transient decrease in liveweight gain was observed particularly in cows. However, {{by the end of the}} period of observation, the weights had recovered so that intensively dipped and immunised and threshold or strategically dipped groups of cattle showed no significant differences. From the results it w as estimated that each engorging female R. appendiculatus caused a temporary depression in weight gain of 8 grams. In young stock the weight loss was excerbated by the presence of <b>screw</b> <b>worm</b> (Chrysomya bezziana) infestation. It was then possible to define an economically attrative integrated tick and theileriosis control strategy based on these findings, whereby immunised cattle were dipped 6 times between mid-December and mid-March. In this regimen, no weight loss occurred and no cases of <b>screw</b> <b>worm</b> were observed. For each of 3 herd sizes of 250. 000 and 1, 000 cattle, comparisons were made of the costs of 4 different control options: 1. Intensive dipping (40 times/year). 2. Intensive pour-on acaricide treatments (18 times/year). 3. Theileria immunisation with strategic dipping (6 times/year). 4. Theileria immunisation with pour-on treatment (4 times/year). It is concluded from these studies that, on farms where theileriosis is a serious problem, immunisation coupled with a strategic dipping programme is economically very attractive. In the year in which immunisation is carried out, costs will be higher than for intensive dipping, but from the second year on, the costs are decreased to approximately 50 percent of those for intensive dipping...|$|R
