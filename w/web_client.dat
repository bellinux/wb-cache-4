It was announced at Google's developer conference on May 18, 2016, and released on September 21, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The non-persistent (or reflected) cross-site {{scripting}} vulnerability {{is by far}} {{the most}} basic type of web vulnerability. These holes show up when the data provided by a <b>web</b> <b>client,</b> most commonly in HTTP query parameters (e.g. HTML form submission), is used immediately by server-side scripts to parse and display a page of results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the request.|$|E
25|$|Today, Usenet {{has diminished}} in {{importance}} {{with respect to}} Internet forums, blogs and mailing lists. Usenet differs from such media in several ways: Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned; information need not be stored on a remote server; archives are always available; and reading the messages requires not a mail or <b>web</b> <b>client,</b> but a news client. The groups in alt.binaries are still widely used for data transfer.|$|E
40|$|We are {{studying}} the effects of deploying a proposed centralized course server in the SUNY Fredonia campus network and introducing mobile <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> using OPNET. We have simulated <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> accessing the server that resides on a Gigabit link in the central network facilities. We also simulate the mobile <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> in classrooms and evaluate their performance. Initial results have indicated negligible packet loss and annoying additional delays but with server connected directly to the central switch, {{the increase in the}} delays is not noticeable. In case of mobile nodes, we are working on the generalized problems of determining the performance with web applications and error rates for various WLAN parameters...|$|R
40|$|Whenever {{database}} centered client-server web applications {{have to be}} used {{by multiple}} <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> on different platforms, then recently XML has been considered as an important data exchange format. If multiple <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> modify their XML copy of some server side database data, then writing this modifications back to the server side database requires transaction synchronization. We present a transaction synchronization protocol for database centered web applications. It is optimistic during the possibly long browse phase of <b>web</b> <b>clients.</b> However, in the commit phase, the scheduler of a given DBMS is integrated. Furthermore, our synchronization protocol reduces transaction conflicts for browsing transactions, which occur often in our typical applications, i. e. market places for web learning. 1.

25|$|The primary {{features}} of HipChat are chat rooms, one-on-one messaging, searchable chat history, image sharing, 5 GB of file storage, and SMS messaging for one-on-one conversations. A premium version adds video calling, screen sharing, unlimited file storage, history retention controls, and a virtual machine version allows HipChat to run within corporate firewalls. A guest access mode allows users {{outside of the}} organization to join a group chat via a shareable URL. Inline GIF playback and custom emoticons are also available. The product is available as a mobile client, a <b>web</b> <b>client</b> and a downloadable native application.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} {{released}} {{under the name}} Seagate Analysis as a free application written in Java released in 1999. After disappointing application performance, {{a decision was made}} to rewrite using ATL COM in C++. The initial rewrite only supported Microsoft Analysis Services, but support for other vendors soon followed, with Holos cubes in version 8.5, Essbase, IBM DB2 and SAP BW following in later releases. The <b>web</b> <b>client</b> was rewritten using an XSLT abstraction layer for the version 9.0 release, with better standards compliance to support Mozilla based browsers—this work also set the building blocks for support for Safari.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, Open Whisper Systems {{introduced}} the second version of their TextSecure Protocol (now Signal Protocol), which added end-to-end encrypted group chat and instant messaging capabilities to TextSecure. Toward {{the end of}} July 2014, Open Whisper Systems announced plans to unify its RedPhone and TextSecure applications as Signal. These announcements coincided with the initial release of Signal as a RedPhone counterpart for iOS. The developers said that their next steps would be to provide TextSecure instant messaging capabilities for iOS, unify the RedPhone and TextSecure applications on Android, and launch a <b>web</b> <b>client.</b> Signal was the first iOS app to enable easy, strongly encrypted voice calls for free. TextSecure compatibility {{was added to the}} iOS application in March 2015.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} of document technologies have strongly impacted {{the evolution of}} <b>Web</b> <b>clients</b> over the last fifteen years, but all <b>Web</b> <b>clients</b> have not taken the same advantage of this advance. In particular, mainstream tools have put the emphasis on accessing existing documents {{to the detriment of}} a more cooperative usage of the Web. However, in the early days, Web users were able to go beyond browsing and to get more actively involved. This paper presents the main features needed to make <b>Web</b> <b>clients</b> more active and creative tools, by taking advantage of the latest advances of document technology. These features are implemented in Amaya, a user agent that supports several languages from the XML family and integrates seamlessly such complementary functionalities as browsing, editing, publishing, and annotating...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a web-based interactive visual component for supporting online collaborative business process management. This component supports {{not only the}} outputs of visual information but also the input of visual information interactively. Most of traditional web-based visualizations are only used for viewing information {{and they are not}} interactive. Theyfocused on how rich graphics could simplify the cognition process in understanding information, but they paid less attention on how to use visualizations as an interface for input and output of information. Most traditional web-based visual components are unable to send input information from <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> to <b>web</b> servers, especially when network firewalls or proxies exist between the <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> and the <b>web</b> server. The web-based interactive visual component introduced in the paper employs a HTTP-based communication module to transfer information from <b>web</b> <b>clients</b> to the <b>web</b> server. The HTTP-based communication module plays the role of the information management infrastructure that receives the information and manages them in an information repository...|$|R
