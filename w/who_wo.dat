Through the earlier pr oject, TCP/RAS/ 6754, `Strengthening the Savings and Credit Operations of Rural Financia l Institutions through the Appropriate Use of Micro-Computers', in which the Phili ppines participated, the MicroBanker system was developed, which allows the computeriza tion of front office transactions in rural bankingProject TCP/PHI/ 8958 was intended to train the national staff <b>who</b> <b>wo</b> uld install MicroBanker systems in rural banks, and maintain and support them; the project also trained national staff to train the end users of the software. The project worked with the Central Bank Institute (CBI), and the Rural Bankers Research and Development Foundation (RBRDF). This work was successfully carried out, and two technical manuals were developed to support training in the MicroBanker system and its installation. T he actual work of installation proceeded well, and a number of enhancements - including a facil ity to print passbooks - were developed. Arrangements were made whereby the RBRDF could reco ver the expenses of installation and maintenance through fees levied on the rural ba nks in question, and this should ensure a technically and financially viable infrastruc ture, in the long termIt was recommended that the Philippines participate actively in the regional MicroBanker infrastructure, as soon as this became established within the Asia a nd Pacific Regional Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA), under the new UNDP/FAO projec t, RAS/ 89 / 068, `Microcomputer Technology Transfer to Rural Banking Units Serving Sm all Farmers, Rural Women and Other Disadvantaged Groups', which was now operational.

This cottage industry was founded by Mr. Ho Chi <b>Wo,</b> <b>who</b> is the author’s father. The story behind the family cottage industry is a typical case that illustrates Hong Kong’s early process of industrialization, and it is essential {{in the understanding of}} Hong Kong’s industrial heritage. Hong Kong’s cottage industry is not a well-documented topic, and there is limited written literature on it. Given the benefit of having the first-hand experience of involving in a cottage industry, the author seizes the opportunity to document his family business in order to provide an in-depth case study that can help broaden the present knowledge of how individual families have contributed to Hong Kong’s industrialization effort. The objective is to provide a case that illustrates the tangible and intangible aspects of Hong Kong’s early industrial heritage. The focus of this dissertation is to investigate the history of the cottage industry Tin Shing during its five years of existence before it transformed into a proper manufacturing company. In particular, the research focuses on the relationship between a cottage industry and the greater society, of how a traditional family-owned cottage industry business responded to Hong Kong’s changing social and economic circumstances in the early 1970 s. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|R

In 905, when Yang grew extremely ill, Yang's oldest son Yang <b>Wo,</b> <b>who</b> was not well-respected by his officers, was serving as the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Xuan Prefecture. Yang Xingmi instructed his secretary Zhou Yin (周隱) to summon Yang Wo, preparing to transfer authorities to him; Zhou opposed this, arguing that Yang Wo was frivolous and an alcoholic, instead suggesting that Yang Xingmi entrust his domain to Liu Wei (劉威), who was then serving as the prefect of Lu Prefecture, instead. Yang Xingmi was shocked by this proposal, and when Xu and Zhang heard of it, they opposed as well on the grounds that Yang Xingmi built his domain and should transfer it to a son; Yang Xingmi agreed. (Subsequently, when Xu and Yan Keqiu realized that Zhou had not sent the order to summon Yang Wo, they took the order and sent it; Yang Wo then returned to Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (揚州). Yang Xingmi transferred his authorities to Yang Wo, and then died. Yang Wo succeeded him and used the lesser title (bestowed by Emperor Zhaozong's emissary Li Yan) the Prince of Hongnong.|$|R

Emperor Zhaozong sent the Zhang Yan, {{the son of the}} former chancellor Zhang Jun, on whom he bestowed the imperial clan surname of Li (and thereafter, Zhang Yan was known as Li Yan), to Huainan as an imperial emissary. Li Yan bestowed the title of supreme commander of the southeastern circuits on Yang and created him the Prince of Wu, ordering him to attack Zhu Quanzhong. As part of the order, Zhu Jin was given the title of military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) (which was then under the rule of Wang Shifan). Yang also bestowed on Zhu Jin the title of deputy supreme commander of the southeastern circuits.

(Xu killed Zhang soon after their assassination of Yang Wo, and while thereafter Yang Longyan was prince, Xu effectively controlled the governance of the Wu state — which was an independent by that point after Zhu Quanzhong usurped the Tang throne in 907 and established Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu, a title that Yang Wo and his successors refused to recognize.) ...|$|R

Most local governors in the Tang empire recognized the new Later Liang emperor as their emperor, with the exceptions of Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), who carried the title of Prince of Jin; Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), who carried the title of Prince of Qi; Yang <b>Wo,</b> <b>who</b> carried the title of Prince of Hongnong (each of whom claimed continued loyalty to the defunct Tang Dynasty but are generally viewed as independent states from this point on); and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), who carried the title of Prince of Shu (and who soon thereafter declared his own state of Former Shu as its emperor). Qian Liu recognized the new Later Liang emperor as well, despite urgings by his staff member Luo Yin to join the other military governors in opposing Later Liang due to its usurpation of the Tang throne. Subsequently, Emperor Taizu created Qian the Prince of Wuyue and also made him the titular military governor of Huainan as well as Zhenhai and Zhendong, and this is traditionally viewed as {{the founding of the}} Wuyue state. [...] However, despite Qian's status as a vassal to Later Liang, instead of using Emperor Taizu's Kaiping era name, he adopted an era name of his own (Tianbao), signifying a claim on his own sovereignty.|$|R

Li Yu was particularly upset with Xu Wen's governance, often stating, [...] "Who is this Xu Wen? I have not even met him, and now he is in control of the state!" [...] In 912, when Xu Jie, then serving as the director of travel pavilions (館驛使, Guanyishi), was on a diplomatic mission to Hongnong's southeastern neighbor Wuyue, Xu Wen had him visit Li Yu at Xuan to try to persuade Li Yu to go to the capital Guangling (廣陵) to pay homage to Yang Longyan. Li Yu initially agreed. However, Xu Jie, during the conversation, stated, [...] "If you do not do so, Lord, people will believe that you are rebelling."

Qualitative research of sustained phenomenological approach in theoretical-philosophical and methodological frame work of Martin Heidegger. The scenario for the production of the data was a South Health Center's Chapecó / SC linked to the Municipal Health Office. The subjects involved, there were five fathers, aged 18 to 24 years. The field stage was developed in two phases with one approach and ambiance with the scenario of there search and the production of data which came from the phenomenological interview with the following research question: How is it for you to be a father? and How was / is your day to day with the discovery of paternity? The interviews were audio recorded on an MP 3 type apparatus, and later transcribed by there searcher. The period for compiling the data was September and October of 2014, after approved by the ethics committee of the Federal University of Southern Frontier/ Campus Chapecó (UFFS / SC). The analysis stage occurred simultaneously to the field stage which showed the time to wax the interviews to reveal the sufficiency of meanings announced by the speeches. Data analysis was base don’t he theoretical framework of Martin Heidegger, <b>who</b> hast <b>wo</b> methodical moments, the vague understanding and median and the hermeneutic analysis. In this study, the first methodical time was used, understanding vague and median, which was developed from listening and attentive reading the interviews, through the suspension assumptions, {{in order to understand the}} meaning that be father-teenager expressed about fatherhood, without imposing predetermined categories by empirical knowledge. In the transcripts were underlined the essential structures, which formed the framework for analysis of the material. Subsequently, the meaning units were established: US 1 - Ever dreamed of being a father, no thought about it for now, when he found that would be father, he wished hiss on, and US 2 - He hadn't plans for the future, with the news, begin stop an the future. Thinks about living well with her son and family to be a real father; and the phenomenological discourse to compose the living concept that is: be-father-teenagering. The survey results also revealed that the be-fatherteenagering express desired paternity, even though un planned child. Announces that she brought you happiness and satisfaction. Demonstrates increased responsibilities and the possibility of returning to school. Reveals the will of caring for the child and be present in his life. Want to have a structured family an disconcerned with the education of children, think it is important that they go to school, because he wants to be a real father.

A paternidade na adolescência promove mudanças e estabelece novos papéis, como o de ser adolescente e ser pai frente à família e a sociedade. Diante desse contexto, tem-se a seguinte questão de pesquisa: Qual o significado da vivência do adolescente acerca da paternidade? E como objetivo do estudo: compreender o significado da vivência do adolescente acerca da paternidade. Pesquisa qualitativa de abordagem fenomenológica sustentada no referencial teórico-filosófico-metodológico de Martin Heidegger. O cenário para produção dos dados foi um Centro de Saúde da região Sul do município de Chapecó/SC vinculado a Secretaria de Municipal Saúde. Os sujeitos envolvidos foram cinco pais, na faixa etária dos 18 aos 24 anos. A etapa de campo foi desenvolvida em dois momentos sendo um deles aproximação e ambientação com o cenário da pesquisa e a produção dos dados a qual ocorreu a partir da entrevista fenomenológica com as seguintes questões de pesquisa: Como é para você ser pai? e Como foi/é seu dia-a-dia com a descoberta da paternidade? As entrevistas foram audiogravadas em um aparelho de MP 3, e posteriormente transcritas pela própria pesquisadora. O período para produção dos dados foi de setembro a outubro de 2014 após aprovação do Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa da Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul/ Campus Chapecó (UFFS/SC). A etapa de análise ocorreu simultaneamente à etapa de campo a qual demonstrou o momento de encerar as entrevistas ao revelar a suficiência de significados anunciados pelos discursos dos sujeitos. A análise dos dados foi pautada no referencial teórico metodológico de Martin Heidegger, que é composta por dois momentos metódicos, a compreensão vaga e mediana e a análise hermenêutica. Nesse estudo, foi utilizado o primeiro momento metódico, a compreensão vaga e mediana, a qual foi desenvolvida a partir da escuta e leitura atentiva das entrevistas, por meio da suspensão de pressupostos, com o objetivo de compreender o significado que o ser-pai-adolescendo expressou sobre a paternidade, sem impor categorias predeterminadas pelo conhecimento empírico. Nas transcrições foram sublinhadas as estruturas essenciais, as quais compuseram o quadro de análise do material. Posteriormente, foram constituídas as unidades de significação: US 1 - Sempre sonhou em ser pai, não pensava nisso para agora, quando soube desejou o filho e US 2 - Não tinha planos para o futuro, com a notícia começa a planejá-lo. Pensa em viver bem com o filho e a família para ser pai de verdade; e o discurso fenomenológico para se compor o conceito vivido qual seja: ser-pai-adolescendo. Os resultados da pesquisa também revelaram que o ser-paiadolescendo expressa que desejou a paternidade, mesmo não tendo planejado o filho. Anuncia que ela lhe trouxe felicidade e satisfação. Demonstra aumento das responsabilidades e a possibilidade de retornar aos estudos. Revela a vontade de cuidar do filho e estar presente na vida dele. Deseja ter uma família estruturada e preocupa-se com a educação dos filhos, acha importante que eles frequentem a escola, pois quer ser um pai de verdade. A compreensão da vivência da paternidade pelo ser-pai-adolescendo revela a necessidade de um espaço de escuta empática para que se assegure a eles melhores maneiras de assistência...|$|R
