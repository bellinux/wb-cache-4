5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> of as the air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw {{them for the first}} time. Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|The Harry Potter {{books have}} also gained {{recognition}} for sparking {{an interest in}} reading among the young {{at a time when}} children <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to be abandoning books for computers and television, although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.|$|E

50|$|To {{the extent}} that melanotan II {{produces}} melanogenesis, this <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> caused by activation of the MC1 receptor, whereas its possible sexual effects <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> related to its ability to activate the MC4 receptor (though the MC3 <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to possibly also be involved).|$|R
5|$|The North Complex is a {{collection}} of several landforms, including craters, that <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to have been formed by volcanic activity. Although the Apollo 15 astronauts were to visit this feature, they were unable to do so due to time constraints and time-consuming issues in obtaining core samples.|$|E
5|$|A {{donation}} from GE/NBC Universal to the Reagan Foundation of 208restored {{episodes of}} General Electric Theater in which Ronald Reagan hosted or appeared from 1954 until 1962.

5|$|After the {{departure}} of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O'odham and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O'odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to be the descendants of the formerly urbanized Hohokam.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> {{to be related to the}} presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E
50|$|The N-terminal {{region of}} the D-alanine—D-alanine ligase <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> {{involved}} in substrate binding, while the C-terminus <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> a catalytic domain.|$|R

50|$|One {{proposed}} {{example of}} Holocene gene flow from Africa to Europe, via the Middle East, <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> E1b1b1, which <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to have emerged about 22,000 {{years ago in}} East Africa, and branches of it <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have migrated to the Middle East by 11,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene or early Neolithic periods.|$|R
5|$|At one time, stable carbenes <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to {{reversibly}} dimerise {{through the}} so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable {{and do not}} dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and air for years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the agents}} in Coley's Toxin that <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> biologically active is a {{lipopolysaccharide}} which causes fever. [...] The resulting fever from the lipopolysaccaride <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to increase lymphocyte activity and boosts tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Tsung and Norton in Surgical Oncology reported that the active agent <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> interleukin-12, rather than TNF.|$|R

5|$|Birds {{have been}} seen as symbols, and used as such, though {{perceptions}} of bird species vary widely across cultures: some birds have a positive image in some regions, a negative image in others. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{widespread}} and often abundant in north and north-east Australia, especially north-east Queensland, and are common {{as far south}} as Victoria. They are also found in southern New Guinea and as rare vagrants in New Zealand and the northern part of Western Australia. The population in northern Australia is estimated at between 20,000 and 100,000 birds and in southern Australia, 1,000 birds. The numbers of individuals in New Guinea are unknown. Until 1961, Brolgas <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to be the only species of crane in Australia, until the Sarus Crane showed up.|$|E
5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} when he was prizefighting Perrins worked for Boulton and Watt, {{manufacturers}} of steam engines, based at their Soho Foundry, Birmingham, but also travelled {{around the country and}} at times acted as an informant on people who <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to have breached his employer's patents. In the later years of his life he also ran a public house in Manchester and undertook engineering work on his own account. He was appointed to lead the Manchester fire brigade in 1799, and died a little over 12months later in the performance of his duties.|$|E
5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices (usually involving {{animals and}} foodstuffs) to various deities, spirits, and ancestors. Deceased ancestors <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> to require {{food and drink}} in the afterlife, so living family members were routinely obligated to offer food and wine to the ancestors in a family shrine or temple. Wealthy families who could afford to bury their dead in large tombs often placed the food items at the entrances of such complexes.|$|E
