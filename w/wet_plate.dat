25|$|On August 15, 2016, Balkowitsch {{travelled}} to Cannon Ball, ND, {{to capture}} {{images of the}} Dakota Access Pipeline protests. The pipeline is to run less than one mile from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation of North Dakota and South Dakota. One {{of only a few}} photographers allowed {{at the scene of the}} protest, Balkowitsch captured images of the protesting encampment. The protest included many people Balkowitsch met during work on a photography project for the Historical Society of North Dakota, Northern Plains Native Americans: A Modern <b>Wet</b> <b>Plate</b> Perspective.

25|$|In the March 1851 {{issue of}} The Chemist, Frederick Scott Archer {{published}} his <b>wet</b> <b>plate</b> collodion process. It {{became the most}} widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on albumen or salted paper.|$|E
50|$|The process lacked {{economical}} success {{because the}} plate {{was much less}} sensitive (about 1/4) and tended to have harder contrasts than <b>wet</b> <b>plates.</b> While the first was acknowledged by Sidebotham, the latter were disputed by him indicating {{the fact that the}} 1860 gold medal for the best landscape photography was made with a Collodion-Albumen plate (Recreative Science, 1861 P 43).|$|R
40|$|Existing {{methods used}} to {{quantify}} microsclerotia of Verticillium dahliae in soil are reviewed. Most quantification methods are soil-type dependent, but are useful for disease prediction within certain soils. The major factor determining the accuracy of dry plating methods {{is the amount of}} soil plated per Petri dish. <b>Wet</b> <b>plating</b> methods are less sensitive to higher amounts of soil, especially when the fraction smaller than 20 mum is removed by wet sieving. Despite general assumptions, <b>wet</b> <b>plating</b> methods do not have lower detection limits than dry plating methods. Dry plating methods are less variable at higher inoculum levels, but more variable at low inoculum levels. Bioassays are helpful tools in answering specific research questions, but are not convenient for large scale use. Molecular quantification techniques are promising, because they are not hampered by antagonistic effects, but data on their disease predictive abilities are still largely lacking. Suggestions are given for a better comparison of techniques, and some original results are presented to illustrate certain arguments...|$|R

2500|$|In 1910 {{an agent}} for The Reviews of Reviews Company, New York, {{publisher}} of [...] The Photographic History of the Civil War, purchased most of the surviving negatives Baton Rouge photographer Andrew Lytle had created during the Federal occupation of Baton Rouge. The agent also spoke to Howard Lytle about the role his father had played in the war. From that conversation and the subsequent write up in The Photographic History the story of Lytle as [...] "camera spy for the Confederacy" [...] was born. Other than this tale, told fifty {{years after the fact}} to a journalist, there is no record any espionage by Lytle. The photographic equipment of the time, including that used by Lytle, involved bulky cameras and large, heavy tripods. The cameras used wet-plate collodion glass-plate negatives with fairly long exposure times. Photographing in the field, a photographer needed a darkroom wagon nearby for preparing the <b>wet</b> <b>plates</b> for exposure and developing them after exposure before they dried. Without a darkroom wagon, a photographer would have required a system of runners or horsemen to relay the <b>wet</b> <b>plates</b> between his studio, the photographic site in the field, and back to his studio.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first study}} of the UV imaging of spots on thin-layer chromatographic <b>plates</b> whilst still <b>wet</b> with solvent. Imaging of spots of benzophenone during and after development was carried out using a charge-coupled device camera. Limits of detection {{were found to be}} 5 ng on a <b>wetted</b> <b>plate</b> and 3 ng for a dry plate and the relationship between peak area and sample loading was found to be linear in the low nanograrn range over an order of magnitude for both wet and dry modes with r(2) values > 0. 99. It was found that UV measurements on <b>wet</b> glass-backed <b>plates</b> suffer from low sensitivity; however, the use of aluminium-backed plates gave increased sensitivity. The apparent absorption coefficient (epsilon(app)) of 10 AU m(2) g(- 1) at 254 nm is consistent with reflection of the light from the aluminium surface with a double pass through the sorbent layer, and suggests that use of aluminium-backed plates should enable monitoring of separations by UV absorbance during TLC development.

50|$|He became {{interested}} in astronomy and travelled to Oran in 1870 to photograph the solar eclipse. In 1871 he acquired a reflecting telescope of 12 inches (30.5 cm) aperture and set {{it up in a}} dome in the gardens of Daramona House. He used it to experiment on the photography of the moon with <b>wet</b> <b>plates</b> and also began to study solar radiation using thermopiles. In 1881, he replaced the original telescope with a Grubb reflector of 24 inches (61 cm) aperture and a new dome and mounting that had an electrically controlled clock drive. The new telescope was mounted in a two-storey tower attached to the house with an attached physical laboratory, darkroom and machine shop.|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1990s, Mann began photographing landscapes on <b>wet</b> <b>plate</b> {{collodion}} 8x10 inch glass negatives, {{and used}} the same 100 year-old 8x10 format bellows view camera that she had used for all the previous bodies of work. These landscapes were first seen in Still Time, and later featured in two shows presented by the Edwynn Houk Gallery in NYC: Sally Mann – Mother Land: Recent Landscapes of Georgia and Virginia in 1997, and then in Deep South: Landscapes of Louisiana and Mississippi in 1999. Many of these large (40"x50") black-and-white and manipulated prints were taken using the 19th century “wet plate” process, or collodion, in which glass plates are coated with collodion, dipped in silver nitrate, and exposed while still wet. This gave the photographs what the New York Times called “a swirling, ethereal image with a center of preternatural clarity," [...] and showed many flaws and artifacts, some from the process and some introduced by Mann.|$|E

40|$|Verticillium wilt in {{strawberries}} is {{an economically}} important disease {{caused by the}} soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae.   A rapid kit-based extraction method and two quantitative PCR assays using specific primers for the quantification of V. dahliae microsclerotia in soils were developed.   For the competitive PCR assay, a heterogeneous competitor DNA fragment was developed as an internal control and found to provide accurate quantification of V. dahliae DNA {{in the range of}} 2 - 200 pg and a detection limit of approximately 60 genomes in soil extract.   SYBR Green I PCR had sensitivity down to one genome of V. dahliae DNA and has detected as little as 0. 1 colony forming unit per gram of soil.   Both PCR methods were tested on 13 naturally infested soil samples and compared with the current <b>wet</b> <b>plating</b> method. In order to relate PCR-based results to infectivity, an approximate estimate {{of the total number of}} genomes in microsclerotia was made, based on fresh microsclerotia produced in vitro in four different size ranges, using SYBT Green I PCR and found to be in range of 100 to 1000 genomes per microsclerotia.   The variability of <b>wet</b> <b>plating</b> results using a common set of soil samples has highlighted the inaccuracy of this method and made it difficult to achieve a reasonable comparison with the quantitative PCR method.   Possible reasons for the differences are discussed.   In general, molecular quantification using SYBR Green I PCR offers faster and more efficient identification of the pathogen in soil and is suitable for routine diagnosis and epidemiological studies of Verticillium wilt. Attempts were made to study the effect of Coniothryium minitans mycoparasitism on V. dahliae.   The results indicated that C. minitans was a poor biocontrol agent for V. dahliae.
