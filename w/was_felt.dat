5|$|The {{earthquake}} <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> {{in several}} southern states {{as far from}} the epicenter as Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, but no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|The quake <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> across {{more than}} a dozen U.S. states and in several Canadian provinces, and <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> by more people than any other quake in U.S. history. No deaths and only minor {{injuries}} were reported. Minor and moderate damage to buildings was widespread and was estimated by one risk-modeling company at $200million to $300million, of which about $100million was insured.|$|E
5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, the earthquake resulted in significant shaking {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
25|$|In Russia, {{the main}} shock could <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (MSK 4) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). The {{aftershock}} at 06:25 UTC could <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in Yuzhno-Kurilsk (MSK 5) and Kurilsk (MSK 4).|$|R
50|$|These {{earthquakes}} {{occurred in}} Moro Gulf, {{off the island}} of Mindanao. The Mw 7.6 earthquake <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> in Philippines, Taiwan, and Malaysia. The Mw 7.4 earthquake <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> in Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the apex}} beat <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> diffusely {{over a large}} area, {{in this case the}} most {{inferior}} and lateral position it can <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in should <b>be</b> described as well as the location of the largest amplitude.|$|R
5|$|In 1727, an {{underground}} fire {{was reported in}} nearby Hinxhill, while a larger earthquake struck the town on 1 June 1756. The 2007 Kent earthquake, which registered 4.3 on the Richter magnitude scale, <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> in Ashford, though its effects were greatest in Folkestone.|$|E
5|$|The day of {{the main}} event two {{aftershocks}} occurred (5.6 at 14:51 and 5.4 at 22:07) but the initial shock was V (Moderate) on the Mercalli intensity scale and the second event <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> only. Ten days following the mainshock on July 31, a stronger aftershock occurred with a local magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). That aftershock <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> in California and western Nevada, broke windows and knocked items of shelves in Bishop, and light fixtures were damaged at the National Weather Service office.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> {{throughout much}} of the six New England states. In New Haven, Connecticut, play at the 2011 New Haven Open at Yale tennis tournament was stopped for two hours and the main stadium was evacuated while the fire department checked it for damage. No damage or injuries were reported. In Boston, Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency reported tremors and swaying buildings but no damage. The U.S. District Court in South Boston was evacuated and the University of Massachusetts Boston closed early. In Maine, the earthquake <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> as far north as Augusta and Portland, but no damage was reported in the state.|$|E
5000|$|... : Tremors <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> {{approximately}} three {{minutes after the}} quake, continuing for about half a minute. This was also the most distant earthquake known ever to <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in Hong Kong. The intensity reached MM III in Hong Kong.|$|R
5000|$|NBA {{commissioner}} David Stern said of Buss [...] "The NBA {{has lost}} a visionary owner whose influence on our league is incalculable and will <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> for decades to come". Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said [...] "His impact <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> worldwide".|$|R
5000|$|This {{pleasure}} <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> most {{immediately and}} acutely {{in the moment}} of association: that is in the reception (or imagination) of a word-form which <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> to have a certain style, and the attribution to it of a meaning which is not received through it.|$|R
5|$|The film is Cooper's {{feature film}} debut. Costa's {{confident}} nature and backstory of being unwillingly {{moved to the}} film's setting of North Pasadena from Queens, New York was developed based on Cooper's auditions, where it <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> he {{gave the impression of}} being from New York City, despite originating from Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> by {{commentators}} to be {{a thinly}} disguised {{reference to the}} Gulf War, while comparisons were drawn between Kilbaba and Saddam Hussein, and between the game's unnamed desert setting and Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The power {{stations}} {{were among the}} last remaining heavy industrial buildings in modern Tyneside, and their demolition <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> by many Tynesiders to have {{marked the end of}} industrial Tyneside. The National Trust was then uninterested in the preservation of modern structures such as this.|$|E
50|$|Cardarelli's sign can <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> by a {{physician}} pressing on the thyroid cartilage and displacing it to the patient's left. This increases contact between the left bronchus and the aorta, allowing systolic pulsations from the aorta to <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> at the surface if an aneurysm is present.|$|R
50|$|About 2,000 {{aftershocks}} <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> throughout Costa Rica.|$|R
25|$|Instruments were {{installed}} {{in and around}} the area in 1974 to closely monitor seismic activity. Since then, more than 4,000 earthquakes have been recorded, most of which were too small to <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b> On average, one earthquake per year is large enough to <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in the area.|$|R
5|$|With {{an area of}} perceptibility {{of around}} 58,500 km2, the shock <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield to San Diego, Palm Springs, and Las Vegas. This is about half the felt area that was seen during the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> over an area of 110,000 km2. The maximum {{intensity}} observed in the urban areas that were affected was VII (Very strong), but the intensity in the epicentral area is unknown because of its remote location in the mountainous Angeles National Forest, though rock slides and landslides occurred there {{as a result of}} strong shaking. Intensity VI (Strong) effects were observed over 1,100 km2, from Altadena and La Verne along the base of the mountains, to East Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> he had been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{when the}} star was first awarded. It has {{received}} mixed reviews from food critics both while {{in its current}} incarnation, and while it was run by head chef Marcus Wareing. It <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that the dishes were sometimes overcomplicated, and designed primarily to gain Michelin stars. The restaurant was named after the French wine Pétrus.|$|E
50|$|The {{emotional}} {{setting is}} very important because it helps the reader understand the Civil War and the character in more depth. Uneasiness and tension <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> {{in the middle of}} the novel when Chris trips over a dead man's leg on the battlefield. Excitement <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> {{in the middle of the}} novel when Chris lets the Federal mules loose. Relief <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> near the end of the novel when Chris discovers that although it was forever changed by the war, Walden’s Ridge was still the finest place on Earth.|$|R
2500|$|There were {{no reports}} of major damage in China {{although}} the quake could <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> there. In Xiamen, Fujian, people evacuated from their home and office to open spaces. The earthquake could also <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in various cities in Guangdong province and Fujian province (e.g. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shantou and Fuzhou.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... : Tremors <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> {{approximately}} three {{minutes after the}} quake.|$|R
5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 as it <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that mixed-power aircraft {{would be of}} some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> {{that there was little}} chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk started {{negotiations}} to end apartheid in South Africa with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). During negotiation, the white South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union merged {{to create the}} South African Rugby Football Union. Rugby {{at the time was}} seen by black South Africans as a symbol of white supremacy. The ANC demanded that the new SARFU improve development of black players. This was because the Springboks team consisted solely of white players at the time, though black players were eligible for selection for the Springboks following the merger of the two governing bodies. Following the yes vote in the South African apartheid referendum in March 1992, the IRB lifted restrictions on tours of South Africa. It was announced that the return test would be against New Zealand. This was criticised in South Africa as the Springboks had not played full international rugby for 11 years and it <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> it would not be competitive however New Zealand were invited because it <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> appropriate after the events around the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour.|$|E
50|$|In {{the state}} of Oaxaca, several {{aftershocks}} of the earthquake <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> throughout various communities. The quake <b>was</b> also <b>felt</b> in the states of Campeche, Guerrero, Michoacán, Morelos, Puebla and Tabasco.|$|R
30|$|Here then, {{facilities}} {{clearly are}} affected, or <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> to <b>be</b> affected, by budget and resource constraints. At the same time, investment is clearly {{being made in}} up-to-date facilities and “expensive” advanced computer systems. Thus, there is a balance between continually advancing {{and at the same}} time still covering all areas of safety and possible risks. Thus, although facilities <b>are</b> <b>felt</b> to <b>be</b> key in risk reduction, issues of cost and coverage need to be considered. What is more, in the context of regulations and facilities, human factors also <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> to play a key role.|$|R
50|$|Extreme pain {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> at {{or around the}} site.|$|R
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> they may do so again.|$|E
5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E
