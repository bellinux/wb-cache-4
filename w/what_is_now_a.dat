5|$|M-37 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. The southern terminus {{is near the}} border between Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties at exit92 of Interstate 94 (I-94) southwest of Battle Creek. The northern terminus is at the Mission Point Light on Old Mission Point in Grand Traverse County. In between, the highway connects Battle Creek, Grand Rapids and Traverse City. Motorists will travel through agricultural land, forests, suburbs and large cities along the way. The section of M-37 on the Old Mission Peninsula was designated <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Pure Michigan Scenic Byway in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} {{a section of}} the former Dixie Highway and US25 in the state. It was first added to the state highway system in 1926 and given its current number in 1973. Previously there were two other {{highways}} that carried the M-125 moniker. One in the 1930s ran through the Upper Peninsula near Thompson and a second from 1938 until the mid-1950s was located in Bay County. The current designation was created in 1973 when US25 was decommissioned in Michigan. The section in downtown Monroe was named <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Pure Michigan Byway in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The London {{version of}} the game was successful, and in 1936 it was {{exported}} to Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, becoming the de facto standard board in the British Commonwealth. It became such a success in the UK that Waddingtons ran Monopoly competitions in locations depicted on the board; one such contest was held on platforms 3 and 4 of Fenchurch Street station. The resulting board has been perennially popular {{around the world and}} the chosen locations have become familiar to millions. Tourists from as far as Canada, Singapore and Saudi Arabia have been known to visit specific locations in London because of their presence on the Monopoly board. In 2003, Watson's grandson (also called Victor Watson) unveiled a plaque at <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> branch of The Co-operative Bank, the original location of the Angel, Islington, to commemorate the elder Watson's contribution to British popular culture.|$|E

50|$|In 1915, a {{building}} designated {{for use as}} the high school <b>was</b> built on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>an</b> East Carolina University parking lot. E. S. Peele served as the first principal of this building.|$|R
50|$|In a {{surprise}} move, Branstool opted {{to run in}} 1998 against Jay Hottinger for his former seat in the Senate. However, he lost in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> solidly Republican district. He since has retired to Utica.|$|R
5|$|The Dixie Highway was {{conceived}} in 1915 to connect Chicago to Miami and commemorate a half-century {{since the end}} of the Civil War. On the suggestion of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, representatives from Michigan convinced the Dixie Highway Association to include Michigan in the proposed auto trail. Two divisions through the Lower Peninsula were included, the eastern one included a route between Detroit and Toledo via Monroe. This section of the Dixie Highway in Monroe County was first added to the state highway system in 1926 when US25 was created. The highway was rerouted through downtown Monroe in the early 1930s; instead of turning westward in downtown to connect to Telegraph Road, the highway instead continued northward to the current Dixie Highway–Telegraph Road intersection. When the US25 designation was decommissioned in the state in 1973, the highway segment between the state line and the Monroe area was given the M-125 designation. The routing has remained unchanged since. In 1995, the section through downtown Monroe was named <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> Pure Michigan Byway.|$|E
25|$|Favourable {{economic}} conditions throughout Australia, cheaper air fares, and two new Spirit of Tasmania ferries have all contributed to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> booming tourism industry.|$|E
25|$|Saint John the Baptist's Church {{was built}} in the townland of Ballyoran in 1783. The {{original}} church sat in the middle of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> large graveyard. A second Catholic church, Saint Patrick's, was built on William Street in 1835.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Sabatier's work, a German chemist, Wilhelm Normann, {{found that}} {{catalytic}} hydrogenation {{could be used}} to convert unsaturated fatty acids or glycerides in the liquid phase into saturated ones. He was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902 and in Britain in 1903, which was the beginning of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> worldwide industry.|$|E

50|$|By 1973, FWRHS {{undertook}} a 25-year lease of 765/767 and in 1974 moved {{the engine to}} New Haven, Indiana to begin <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> restoration to operation. On October 25, the locomotive was returned to its original number and restoration officially began.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} McCaw's focus turned from dealing {{licenses}} to servicing the network, signing up customers in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> maturing technology {{on the cusp}} of explosive growth.

25|$|The {{history of}} Oil Creek State Park {{is tied to}} {{the rise and fall of}} the oil {{industry}} in northwestern Pennsylvania. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> wild second growth forest with several cold water fishery creeks flowing through it, was once the site of the vast oil industry that changed the landscape and water quality of the Oil Creek Valley.|$|E
25|$|People in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> south-central Georgian region {{continued}} to favor {{a variant of}} the old Mushki name, and today call themselves Meskhs and their region Meskheti. They speak a dialect of Georgian called Meskhuri, which among Georgia's regional dialects is relatively close to official Georgian. The town of Mtskheta is not in today's Meskheti region, but lies about 100km to its northeast, in the Kartli region.|$|E
50|$|Since 2001, {{the college}} has been {{recording}} its lectures and releasing them online in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>an</b> archive of over 2,000 lectures.Annual lectures of particular note {{hosted by the}} college include: the Gresham Special Lecture, the Annual Lord Mayor’s Event, and the Gray’s Inn Reading.|$|R
50|$|During {{its final}} season in 1992, the Pride posted a 22-13 record, placing second in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> 10-team league. At this point, however, the WBL was in trouble, and it disbanded before {{the close of}} the season. The league's {{unraveling}} is attributed to waning public interest.|$|R
50|$|The 5 Point Cafe serves large {{portions}} of traditional American food and stiff drinks at inexpensive prices.

25|$|After {{simmering}} {{treaty and}} border disputes finally erupted into the War of 1812, the Hamilton area again became a strategic area. In 1813, the British regulars and Canadian militia defeated invading American troops at the Battle of Stoney Creek which was fought in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> park in eastern Hamilton. Burlington Heights, {{adjacent to the}} grounds of present-day Dundurn Park and Castle, was also a site commanding the entry to Burlington Bay.|$|E
25|$|When one {{track of}} a {{double-track}} railway {{is out of}} service for maintenance or a train breaks down, all trains may be concentrated on the one good track. There may be bi-directional signalling and suitable crossovers to enable trains {{to move on to}} the other track expeditiously (see, for example, the article on the Channel Tunnel), or there may be some kind of manual safeworking to control trains on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> section of single track. See single-line working.|$|E
25|$|Then Montgomery {{successfully}} challenged Jones in the 1959-1960 primary cycle. In the December 7 primary, Montgomery led Jones, 7,929 (46.6 percent) to 6,542 (38.5 percent), but {{two other}} candidates polled a critical 2,536 votes (14.9 percent). In the runoff election on January 9, Montgomery easily defeated Jones, 11,116 (66.5 percent) to 5,611 (33.5 percent) and won sixty-eight of the seventy precincts in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> revised District 36. In his five state senate campaigns (two unsuccessful), Montgomery never faced a Republican opponent.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{built by}} Walter Branscombe, Bishop of Exeter from 1258 to 1280, the chapel {{occupied}} the present south wing, where a large rose window containing four cusped trefoils originally set within the outer gable {{of the west}} wall survives on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>an</b> internal wall, hidden behind a later chimney stack in the attic.|$|R
50|$|Szlumper now {{pointed out}} that the line had been {{properly}} opened because of the failure of the Inspecting Officer to visit during the allowed ten days, and that the BoT had no power to order the suspension of traffic on <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>an</b> open railway, as opposed to the opening of a new railway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any passion so great, so complete," [...] Mitchy went on, [...] "is--satisfied or unsatisfied--a life."

[...] "She's not TOO sorry for herself." ...|$|R
25|$|Over 2000 {{men from}} Walsall {{were killed in}} {{fighting}} during the First World War. They are commemorated by the town's cenotaph: which {{is located on the}} site of a bomb which was dropped by Zeppelin 'L 21' – killing the town's mayoress, and two others. Damage from the Zeppelin can still be seen on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> club {{on the corner of the}} main road, just opposite the furniture shop. A plaque commemorates the incident. The town also has a memorial to two local VC recipients, John Henry Carless and Frederick Gibbs.|$|E
25|$|Local train {{services}} {{operate in}} the central, southern and eastern sections {{of the city and}} are operated by South West Trains, with stations at Swaythling, St Denys, Millbrook, Redbridge, Bitterne, Sholing and Woolston. Plans were announced by Hampshire County Council in July 2009 for the introduction of tram-train running from Hythe (on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> freight-only line to Fawley) via Totton to Southampton Central Station and on to Fareham via St. Denys, and Swanwick. The proposal follows a failed plan to bring light rail to the Portsmouth and Gosport areas in 2005.|$|E
25|$|On November 24, 2010, the State of Tennessee {{awarded a}} $960,000 {{enhancement}} {{grant from the}} Tennessee Department of Transportation to help purchase the property where the Domino's Pizza and mini-mart is located. A local preservation organization is also hoping to purchase 16 acres of land in two parcels: five acres located southwest of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> small park called the Collin's Farm located at {{the southeast corner of}} the Lewisburg Pike and the Nashville and Decatur Railroad that was preserved a few years ago; and 11 acres located near the corner of Lewisburg Pike and Carnton Lane.|$|E

50|$|After the {{extinction}} of Kevernburger from 1302 to 1306, the counts of Schwarzburg took possession of Arnstadt. Attempts by Erfurt 1342 and 1345 to seize <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> wealthy town failed due to the strong attachment. Arnstadt's prosperity {{was based on the}} milling industry, the cloth-making trade, tanneries, and trade in wine, woad, wood, grain, wool, and vegetables.|$|R
50|$|Further {{revisions}} to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> work {{in two parts}} (after the omission of the original first part) were made between September and December 1898. At this point, Mahler’s previous decision to remove the off-stage brass was reversed. The 1898 revisions were in fact so extensive that Mahler had to write out an entirely new manuscript score.|$|R
