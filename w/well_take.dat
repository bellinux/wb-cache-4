500|$|... "Unfaithful" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from most music critics. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described [...] "Unfaithful" [...] as [...] "a profoundly ludicrous – but not disagreeable – pop lament". Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters [...] commented that, [...] "Unfaithful' is a well-intentioned ballad informed by dramatic piano and strings". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani stated, [...] "The melodramatic, string-laden ballad 'Unfaithful' is, if nothing else, an ambitious second single {{for an artist}} like Rihanna, and with lyrics like 'I don't {{want to be a}} murderer/Our love, his trust/I might as <b>well</b> <b>take</b> a gun and put it to his head,' it earns bonus points just for being so fucking weird".|$|E

Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap." [...] Mel B appeared on the same radio show the following day and said, [...] "They're all scared of me and I love it, there's got to be one bitch on the show so I might as <b>well</b> <b>take</b> that bloody crown." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits...we figured we might as <b>well</b> <b>take</b> that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E

2500|$|Jascha Heifetz ( [...] ; 10 December 1987) was a Lithuanian-born Russian violinist. Many {{consider}} {{him to be}} the greatest violinist of all time. Born in Vilna, he moved as a teenager to the United States, where his Carnegie Hall debut was rapturously received. He was a virtuoso since childhood—Fritz Kreisler, another leading violinist of the twentieth century, said on hearing Heifetz's debut, [...] "We might as <b>well</b> <b>take</b> our fiddles and break them across our knees." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Fisher model, {{the fates}} of the balls are {{independent}} {{and there is}} no dependence between draws. We may as <b>well</b> <b>take</b> all n balls at the same time. Each ball has no [...] "knowledge" [...] of what happens to the other balls. For the same reason, {{it is impossible to know}} the value of n before the experiment. If we tried to fix the value of n then we would have no way of preventing ball number n+1 from being taken without violating the principle of independence between balls. n is therefore a random variable, and the Fisher distribution is a conditional distribution which can only be determined after the experiment when n is observed. The unconditional distribution is two independent binomials, one for each color.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the grand}} jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case {{involved}} capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912 for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises. In his closing statement Sanders challenged the all-male jury to have the [...] "manhood" [...] to [...] "defend the law of my country and its liberty-loving people" [...] or else [...] "we {{might just as well}} dynamite this old courthouse. We might just as <b>well</b> <b>take</b> his Honor off the bench and say we have no law in Nye County." ...|$|E
2500|$|During late 1772 Lavoisier {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the phenomenon of combustion, the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when phosphorus burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce acid spirit of phosphorus, and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of sulfur and went on to add that [...] "what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may <b>well</b> <b>take</b> place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause." ...|$|E
2500|$|The College, accordingly, {{set to work}} {{to carry}} out the Principal's wishes. The sale of Piddington {{realized}} £1,850, two other legacies of £66 13s. 4d. and £15 respectively came in, and a subscription list shows that money continued to be given from time to time up to November 1671, when the total sum subscribed amounted to £4,775 4s. 4d. As well these legacies and subscriptions in cash, the College possessed a very valuable asset {{in the shape of the}} old buildings of St. Mary's College, which helped to keep costs down. This property was acquired in 1580 and in 1584 was let with the proviso that any unroofed buildings might be pulled down whenever required. In 1628, two masons and two carpenters viewed the buildings and other accessories which had been erected since it came into the hands of the College, and valued them at £1,480. Whether the College had any designs as to the ultimate fate of the Chapel belonging to St. Mary's College before 1649 is unclear, but by this time its destruction was certainly planned, for the site was let to one John Kinge of the Inner Temple, reserving the right to [...] "enter in with workmen and labourers, carts and horses, to pull down the old Chapel, and to carry away the materials to build the new Chapel according to the intencion of the last will and testament of Samuel Radcliffe". Even if a site for the new buildings had not been prescribed in the will, there would have been no difficulty in finding one. The College had rented since 1530 and now finally acquired both Little St. Edmund Hall and the large piece of garden separating it from William Smyth's buildings, a plot well suited for the formation of a small quadrangle, with a [...] "covered walk" [...] on one side. The Chapel could very <b>well</b> <b>take</b> the place of St. Edmund Hall itself, then to be pulled down, and be connected with the rest of the College by the cloister or covered walk, to which the Principal attached so much importance.|$|E
