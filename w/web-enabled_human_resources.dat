40|$|Abstract]: <b>Human</b> <b>resource</b> {{auditing}} {{crosses the}} boundaries between <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> management and auditing. The main message from {{this study is that}} a <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance audit can be a suitable method for evaluating the contribution of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> activities to organisational objectives, assessed on the basis of value for money. The case study demonstrated that a <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance audit can identify areas where additional value can be obtained from an already valued, well regarded and award winning <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> department. The <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance auditing methodology is set down in the Australian auditing standards (Australian Auditing Standards 806 & 808) and assumes a professional practice framework for auditors. A <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management performance audit is future orientated and can identify areas for organisational improvement. Where the literature on <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> auditing is not grounded in auditing, it is flawed. Dolenko (1990) outlined a methodology for applying auditing techniques to <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management but later literature is clouded by alternative commentary that defines <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> auditing in quite different ways (Clardy 2004). The literature on <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> auditing should be reviewed to ensure that it is firmly grounded in auditing. This research is aimed at bridging a gap in both knowledge and practice.
