The society began a campaign against the entertainment industry, claiming all theatrical activity on a Sunday were unethical, and cited a 1667 law which made it illegal. With 60 leading entertainers already avoiding Sunday working, Dean informed Formby that his stance would be crucial in avoiding a spread of the problem. Formby issued a statement, [...] "I'll hang up my uke on Sundays only when our lads stop fighting and getting killed on Sundays... as far as the Lord's Day Observance Society are concerned, they can mind their own bloody business. And in any case, <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>they</b> done for the war effort except get on everyone's nerves?" [...] The following day it was announced that the pressure from the society was to be lifted.|$|E

It's {{going to be hard}} for any game to be able to make a claim that they look better... to even be close, to me is quite an honour as a developer. The one thing I did was, when I looked at their game I was like, damn them! <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>they</b> done to the rest of us? I was looking for something where I could say, okay, that we're doing better." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{scarcely}} answered him. My {{eyes were}} fixed upon the tangled wilderness of red and green lights, amongst which that train <b>had</b> disappeared. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>they</b> done to her, these people, that she should scarcely {{have been able to}} crawl across the platform? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>they</b> done to make her accept their bidding, and leave England without a word or message to any of us? It had not been of her own choice, I was sure enough of that.|$|R
60|$|The breathless {{sense of}} really monstrous {{injustice}} cut {{the power of}} speech in Soames' throat. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> HE done! <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>they</b> done to him! And with quite unconscious dignity {{he put his hand}} on his breast, and looked at her.|$|R

5000|$|All {{the people}} of this world find nothing in the end of this life, and they find {{themselves}} in nothingness, rather in hells. Why is it like that?

It did not really work.|$|R

She saw John go up to her aunt and hold out his hand.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if the murderers were, for a few moments, awestruck and horrified by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done; but <b>they</b> quickly recovered. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> set their faces to {{accomplish}} must now be done at all hazards.|$|R
