5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving {{the problem of how}} to design a boat that would be small and light enough to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components <b>would</b> <b>double</b> as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|In May 1960, {{the then}} Oregon State College was {{advanced}} $19,000 {{by the federal}} government to plan for a new $2,170,000 building. The new building was designed by architects Hamlin & Martin, and the cost rose to $2.4 million by the time the school accepted bids on the project in April 1962. Ground was broken on the project on May 1, 1962, with Shields Construction Company as the general contractor for the project. The new building <b>would</b> <b>double</b> the size of Oregon State's library.|$|E
5|$|The city of Arlington had a {{population}} of 17,926 people {{at the time of}} the 2010 U.S. census, making it the ninth largest of eighteen cities in Snohomish County. From 1980 to 2010, Arlington's population increased by over 450 percent, fueled by the construction of suburban housing and annexations of outlying areas. The United States Census Bureau estimates the city's 2016 population at 19,112. In 2005, the Arlington city council projected that the city's population <b>would</b> <b>double</b> from 15,000 to 30,528 by 2025.|$|E
50|$|The race {{can also}} be seen as a contest between two of California’s {{interest}} groups: Labor and Indian gaming. The two groups clashed over five tribal compacts that <b>would</b> <b>doubled</b> the number of slot machines at Indian casinos. Labor groups fought the compacts because they believed the compacts did not adequately protect workers.|$|R

5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these <b>would</b> <b>double</b> as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
25|$|Instigator penalty: An {{instigator}} of an altercation is {{a player}} who demonstrates {{any of the following}} actions: distance travelled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude. A player deemed an instigator will receive an instigating minor penalty. A player who instigates a fight in the final five minutes of a game will receive an automatic one-game suspension. The length of the suspension <b>would</b> <b>double</b> for each additional incident. The player's coach will be fined $10,000, a penalty that <b>would</b> <b>double</b> for each recurrence.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, City Council {{adopted the}} Cincinnati Metropolitan Master Plan, which {{incorporated}} the Third Street Distributor along with long-range plans to completely redevelop the Bottoms as a mixed-use development, {{including a new}} baseball stadium to replace Crosley Field.

25|$|The new {{restaurant}} would also {{do away with}} traditional kitchen stations and hierarchy previously common in the restaurant industry, and <b>would</b> <b>double</b> {{the size of the}} restaurant kitchen. A new station was included to sous vide food. Another modernization is to have seasonal ingredients dictate the menu, as opposed to the previous restaurant's dishes dictating the ingredients purchased.|$|E

25|$|Population {{growth is}} strong. In 1990, there were 7,400 people in Kiryas Joel; in 2000, 13,100, nearly {{doubling}} the population. In 2005, the population {{had risen to}} 18,300. The 2010 census showed a population of 20,175, for a population growth rate of 53.6% between 2000 and 2010, which was less than anticipated, as it was projected that the population <b>would</b> <b>double</b> in that time period.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{immigrants}} settle predominantly {{in seven}} states, California, New York, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois, comprising about 44% of the U.S. {{population as a}} whole. The combined total immigrant population of these seven states was 70% of the total foreign-born population in 2000. If current birth rate and immigration rates were to remain unchanged for another 70 to 80 years, the U.S. population <b>would</b> <b>double</b> to nearly 600 million.|$|E

25|$|On 2 July 2012 in {{a coordinated}} press release, the ship's owner, {{operator}} and Port Rashid operator, DP Ports, jointly announced QE2 would re-open as a 300-bed hotel after an 18-month refit. The release claims {{the ship was}} to be refitted to restore original features, including her 1994–2008 'Heritage Trail' of classic Cunard artefacts. The ship was to be berthed alongside a redeveloped Port Rashid cruise terminal which <b>would</b> <b>double</b> as a maritime museum.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, President Sisi {{initiated}} a new Suez Canal which <b>would</b> <b>double</b> {{capacity of the}} existing canal from 49 to 97 ships a day.

The project cost around 60 billion Egyptian-pounds ($8.4 billion) and was fast-tracked over a year. Sisi insisted funding come from Egyptian sources only. The new canal was inaugurated on schedule on 6 August 2015.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} termed Remix & Return would blend {{high-level waste}} with uranium mine and mill tailings {{down to the}} level of the original radioactivity of the uranium ore, then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who <b>would</b> <b>double</b> as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence in it of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium.|$|E

25|$|Capacity is {{inversely}} proportional to headway. Therefore, moving from two-second headways to one-second headways <b>would</b> <b>double</b> PRT capacity. Half-second headways would quadruple capacity. Theoretical minimum PRT headways {{would be based on}} the mechanical time to engage brakes, and these are much less than a half second. Although no regulatory agency has as yet (June 2006) approved headways shorter than two seconds, researchers suggest that high capacity PRT (HCPRT) designs could operate safely at half-second headways. Using the above figures, capacities above 10,000 passengers per hour seem in reach.|$|E
25|$|The Gateway Program is {{the planned}} phased {{expansion}} and {{renovation of the}} Northeast Corridor (NEC) rail line between Newark, New Jersey, and New York City, New York. The proposed project would cost about 20 billion dollars and would be completed in 2026. Once completed the improvements <b>would</b> <b>double</b> train capacity (25 extra trains per hour) and would allow for additional high-speed rail service. The existing two-track rail line used by both Amtrak (AMTK) and New Jersey Transit (NJT) has reached full capacity.
