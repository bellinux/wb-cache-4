5000|$|A certain {{category}} of small-world networks {{were identified as}} a class of random graphs by Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz in 1998. They noted that graphs could be classified according to two independent structural features, namely the clustering coefficient, and average node-to-node distance (also known as average shortest path length). Purely random graphs, built according to the Erdős-Rényi (ER) model, exhibit a small average shortest path length (varying typically as the logarithm {{of the number of}} nodes) along with a small clustering coefficient. Watts and Strogatz measured that in fact many real-world networks have a small average shortest path length, but also a clustering coefficient significantly higher than expected by random chance. Watts and Strogatz then proposed a novel graph model, currently named the Watts and Strogatz model, with (i) a small average shortest path length, and (ii) a large clustering coefficient. The crossover in the Watts-Strogatz model between a [...] "large world" [...] (such as a lattice) and a small world was first described by Barthelemy and Amaral in 1999. This work was followed by a large number of studies, including exact results (Barrat and <b>Weigt,</b> 1999; Dorogovtsev and Mendes; Barmpoutis and Murray, 2010).Braunstein [...] found that for weighted ER networks where the weights have a very broad distribution, the optimal path scales becomes significantly longer and scales as N1/3.|$|E

One of the advantage of triangles over lines is that triangles uniquely define three linearly independent vectors in 3 D. These three vectors {{can be used as}} a local coordinate system. Deformation is described by a set of source and destination triangles. For each source and destination triangle and for any point 3 D space, we can compute a unique transformation vector for any given source and destination triangles. We combine these transformation vectors described by each deformer pair, by using a <b>weigted</b> average that is a function of the distance to the source traingle. In the paper, we provide a set of blending functions to effectively interpolate these transformation vectors from each triangle to compute a combined transformation. To obtain a deformation of a given polygonal mesh, we simply translate each vertex of the polygonal mesh with a combined transformation vector that is computed by using the position of the vertex. Our technique can be used for both 2 D and 3 D deformation. We have implemented systems for interactive 2 D and 3 D deformations. In our 2 D implementation, we use line and point deformers in addition to triangles. 1...|$|R

40|$|E-, P- and L-selectin {{belong to}} the C-type lectin family of cell {{adhesion}} molecules that initiate inflammatory response. Infammation per se is a physiologocal defense mechanism, but excessive leukcyte extravasation leads to numerous pathoIogical and disease states, as well as metastatic cancer spread. Leukocyte tethering and rolling toward inflammatory site start with the interaction of selectins and the carbohydrate epitope of their glycoprotein ligands, sialyl Lewisx. Therefore inhibitors of selectin-ligand interaction are of high pharmaceutical interest as potent anti-inflammatory agents. Tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewisx serves as a lead strucure in chemical and computational search for selectin antagonists. Structural NMR and X-ray studies indicated binding mode of sialyl Lewisx with E-, and P-selectin, but improved structural studies with {{the second and third}} generation antagonists is missing. We expressed recombinant human E-, P- and L-selectin/IgG as secreted proteins in mammalian expression system and purified them to homogniety. Acitivity of the proteins was confirmed with blocking monoclonal antibodies and ligand binding confirmed by NMR. Bioassays were developed in cell-free and cell-based formats with E-selectin/IgG to evaluate inhibitory potencies of in-house synthesized selectin antagonists. Due to variation and instabilities on day-to-day and batch-to-batch basis, assays were used only for preliminary antagonists screen. To enhance further structural studies, we developed a new system for the expression of truncated form of human E-selectin (lectin and EGF-like domains). Initialy we tried to express these two domains in E. coli, but refolding of expressed inclusion bodies was inefficient. Therefore lectin and EGF-like domains of human E-selectin were expressed as secreted form in baculovirus-infeced insect cells with a flag-epitope on its C-terminus. Expressed protein (LecEGFFlag) was monomeric in solution, correctly folded and active, as confirmed in the reaction with monoclonal blocking antibodies, and NMR studies. Protein was expressed in two distinct glycosylation forms, with apparent molecular <b>weigts</b> of 19. 96 kDa and 21. 15 kDa. In addition, we developed {{for the first time a}} cell-free assay with truncated form of Eselectin (aforementioned LecEGFFlag) for the evaluation of of E-selectin inhibitors. In a proof-of-concept manner, three different E-selectin antagonists were tested and obtained IC 50 values were in close agreement with published results. Reproducibility and stability of the assay on day-to-day and batch-to batch basis make it suitable not only for the preliminary screening, but also to quantify inhibitory potencies of E-selectin antagonists.

Za kontrolno obravnavanje smo pri vsaki sorti uporabili obravnavanje brez dodanega dušika (0 kg N ha- 1). Med rastno dobo krompirja je bil analiziran indeks listne površine, višina rastline in število stebel na posameznem obravnavanju. Ob spravilu smo pridelek gomoljev stehtali in sortirali po debelini na drobne, srednje debele in debele gomolje. Ciljna vrednost 173 kg N ha- 1 ima statistično značilen vpliv na pridelek krompirja (31, 0 kg 10 m- 2), med posameznimi ciljnimi vrednostmi N pa ni razlik (obravnavanje 133 in 153 N, pridelek 25, 4 in 24, 6 kg 10 m- 2). Pri morfoloških lastnostih je največji indeks listne površine dosežen pri obravnavanju 173 kg N ha- 1 (2, 7). Na višino rastlin in število stebel imata sorti in ciljne vrednosti statistično značilen vpliv. Največja višina je dosežena pri sorti 2 ̆ 7 Carlingford 2 ̆ 7 (64, 3 cm) in pri obravnavanju 153 kg N ha- 1 (58, 1 cm), največje število stebel pa pri sorti 2 ̆ 7 Desiree 2 ̆ 7 (4, 9) in pri obravnavanju 173 kg N ha- 1 (5, 0). Systematic {{fertilization}} {{of potato}} {{on the basis}} of analysis becomes the only recommended practice.

For the control treatment no nitrogen was added to the soil for each individual variety (0 kg N ha- 1). During the growing season of potatoes, we analyzed the leaf area index, plant height and the number of stems in a particular test area. At harvest, the tuber crops were <b>weigted</b> and sorted according to the thickness into small, medium, and large tubers. The target value of 173 kg N ha- 1 {{had a significant impact on}} the potato yield (31. 0 kg 10 m- 2), while there was no difference between the target values of treatment 133 N and 153 N, which resulted in the yield of 25, 4 and 24, 6 kg 10 m- 2. In the morphological characteristics, the largest leaf area index is achieved in the treatment of 173 kg N ha- 1 (2. 7).
