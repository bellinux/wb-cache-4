40|$|The most {{significant}} trend {{and development in}} workmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensation</b> law {{in the past year}} has been the activity of the appellate courts in annulling and reversing the decisions of the Workmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Compensation</b> Appeals Board. With the Labor Code 2 ̆ 7 s severe limitations on the scope of judicial review of WCAB decisions, particularly on the right of the courts to review factual determinations, and with most of the WCAB cases containing factual rather than legal questions, the majority of petitions for writ of review have been and still are being denied.

40|$|In Eliker v. D. H.

This represents a new interpretation of the requirement that the employee 2 ̆ 7 s injury occur 2 ̆ 2 in the course of employment. 2 ̆ 2 The new interpretation introduces factors which before were relevant only to the requirement that the employee experience an 2 ̆ 2 accident. 2 ̆ 2 In reaching its decision, the court reviewed the trial court 2 ̆ 7 s findings of fact, and thus departed from the established standard of review for workmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensation</b> cases.

40|$|Reducing {{unemployment}} and then creating productive employment {{are two of}} the greatest obstacles in most developing countries. Achieving the two programs, however, faces a dilemma. In one hand, creating employment widely leads to decline labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensation.</b> On the other hand, increasing labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensations</b> imply that employers would alter their production techniques into capital intensives (i. e. lay off their workers). This paper tests the hypothesis that workers whose compensation packages contain a profit sharing component are less susceptible to lay off in the face of negative shocks to product demand than are workers paid a fixed, time-based wage. The theory is tested on macroeconomic data, especially in the two selected manufacturing industries in Indonesia. The estimation result shows that profit-sharing meet the theoretical requirements for stabilizing employment. It means that profit sharing could be considered as a means to combat unemployment...|$|R

40|$|Radiofrequency {{neurotomy}} is a pain intervention procedure {{designed to}} coagulate nerves that innervate a specific area of spinal vertebrae {{known as the}} facet joint. Despite moderate to strong research support for the efficacy of radiofrequency neurotomy to improve short-term subjective pain levels, {{much of the literature}} to date has used strict selection criteria and has not focused on functional and quality of life outcomes. Moreover, few studies have examined outcomes in worker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensation</b> patients or considered biopsychosocial predictive variables for the procedure. The current study aimed to characterize injured workers who have undergone radiofrequency neurotomy across a number of pre and post-procedural variables, evaluate multidimensional functional and quality of life outcomes, and examine biopsychosocial variables predictive of success and failure in this sample.

40|$|Beginning with workmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensation</b> in 1910 {{and getting}} great impetus from the {{depression}} of the 19302 ̆ 7 s, social insurance legislation has grown apace in America. Such legislation {{is based on a}} faith that the general welfare is best served by protecting individuals from the consequences of pecuniary loss through such vicissitudes of life as accident, old age, sickness, and unemployment. The chief pecuniary losses are destruction of earning power and the expenses of medical care and cure and rehabilitation. Under these schemes, such losses are met (or partly met) without regard to questions of personal fault in causing them and are distributed over a wide segment of society. So much all this legislation has in common, but beyond this there are differences. The broadest possible scheme would largely disregard the source of loss and distribute its cost either by general taxation or by tax contributions levied on a flat rate upon a very large group (e. g., all employers). The philosophy of workmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensation,</b> on the other hand, is that losses should be allocated to the enterprise that creates the hazards that causes the losses, and ultimately distributed among those who consume its products. Under such a system there is room for private insurance, and most of our states permit it to be handled that way. Still a third type of scheme seeks to distribute its costs among its beneficiaries, much as voluntary accident or health insurance does. And these variant notions are often found in combination...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} whether an employee is precluded from bringing a workmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compensation</b> action {{in one state}} because he has previously received payments under another state 2 ̆ 7 s statute arises where an injury or an employment relationship has ties with two or more states. This is a common problem because of existing differences in the various state compensation acts, and it is intensified because of increasing multistate business activities. The problem most frequently presented to the courts is whether the forum state will award second payments under its act when it authorizes a greater amount of compensation than the first state. Other facets of the problem have also been presented to the courts. For example, {{what happens when the}} employee has been denied compensation in the prior state; or when statutory differences exist relating to the employee 2 ̆ 7 s rights to bring actions outside the compensation act? The current importance of the question of applicability of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s act after prior payments have been received is pointed up by the following facts. The effect of receiving prior payments under another state 2 ̆ 7 s act is not specifically provided for in Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s act.
