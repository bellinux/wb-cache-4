40|$|Cyclohexane {{allowed to}} {{capillary}} condense from vapor in an annular <b>wedge</b> pore <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> in a surface force apparatus (SFA) remains liquid down {{to at least}} 14 K below the bulk melting-point T(m). This {{is an example of}} supercooling of a liquid due to confinement, like melting-point depression in porous media. In the wedge pore, however, the supercooled liquid is in equilibrium with vapor, and the amount of liquid (and thereby the radius of curvature r of the liquid-vapor interface) depends on the surface tension gamma(LV) of the liquid, not the interfacial tension between the solid and liquid. At coexistence r is inversely proportional to the temperature depression Delta T below T(m), in accordance with a recently proposed model [P. Barber, T. Asakawa, and H. K. Christenson, J. Phys. Chem. C 111, 2141 (2007) ]. We have now extended this model to include effects due to the temperature dependence of both the surface tension and the enthalpy of melting. The predictions of the improved model have been quantitatively verified in experiments using both a Mark IV SFA and an extended surface force apparatus (eSFA). The three-layer interferometer formed by the two opposing, backsilvered mica surfaces in a SFA was analyzed by conventional means (Mark IV) and by fast spectral correlation of up to 40 fringes (eSFA). We discuss the absence of freezing in the outermost region <b>of</b> the <b>wedge</b> pore down to 14 K below T(m) and attribute it to nonequilibrium (kinetic) supercooling, whereas the inner region of the condensate is thermodynamically supercooled...|$|R

Here, we investigate the role that the global geometry of the substrate surfaces has on the structure of the CNT film. On a flat mica or silica surface, the evaporation of a convex droplet of the CNT dispersion induces the well-known "coffee ring", while evaporation of a concave droplet (capillary meniscus) of the CNT dispersion in a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> two planar <b>mica</b> sheets or between two crossed-cylinder sheets induces a large area (>mm 2) of textured or patterned films characterized by different short- and long-range orientational and positional ordering of the CNTs. The resulting patterns appear to be determined by two competing or cooperative sedimentation mechanisms: (1) capillary forces between CNTs giving micrometer-sized filaments parallel to the boundary line of the evaporating droplet and (2) fingering instability at the boundary line of the evaporating droplet and subsequent pinning of CNTs on the surface giving micrometer-sized filaments of CNTs perpendicular to this boundary line. The interplay between substrate surface geometry and sedimentation mechanisms gives an extra control parameter for manipulating patterns of self-assembling nanoparticles at substrate surfaces. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R

When 3 % of PVA fibers were added the tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> paper increased significantly. It is because PVA fibers can smelt and act as bond for mica flake and aramid fiber under high temperature. The optimum beating degree of aramid fiber was 35 oSR, and the optimum drying temperature was 100 ℃?.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{series of}} laboratory studies <b>of</b> aggregates containing <b>mica</b> minerals obtained from aggregate producers located throughout Sweden. The main {{idea of the}} research was to study physical properties and behaviour <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in unbound granular products of crushed rock materials. Another objective was to highlight the detrimental properties <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> occurrence in aggregates used for road construction industry and determine the applicable methods for quantitative determination <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> minerals presence. Due {{to the lack of}} previous investigations looking at this or similar subject, the current research can have international importance, especially for countries with crystalline, mica rich bedrock and temperate, subarctic climates. Recently a number of cases involving road construction failures and decrease in service life have been observed in northern parts of Sweden. One of the major reasons for the structural deterioration was enrichment <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in aggregates and their interaction with water. Due to this reason first paper of this thesis represents a study of the behaviour <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> grains in crushed rock aggregates of metamorphic origin and recognition of any trend of enrichment <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> grains aggregates. As a result two general trends <b>of</b> enrichment <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> were obtained: Type I (isotropic source rock) and Type A (anisotropic source rock). Type I is exemplified by a general increase <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> towards finer grain fractions, with or without a peak for "coarser" grain fractions. Type A represents an increase <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> up to a certain grain fraction, thereafter no increase occurs towards finer grain fractions. Second part of the thesis focuses on the determination of the possible analytical methods which are susceptible to mica content and could be used as indicating technique for quantitative determination <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> particles in unbound granular materials. Two standard methods: Sand equivalent test and Methylene blue test were assumed as the most sensitive to mica presence. Both methods showed susceptibility to mica content and gave strong correlation in terms <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> content. The third paper enhances knowledge of the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>mica</b> rich aggregates in interaction with water in terms of fraction sizes and free mica content. During the experiment several aggregates with different content <b>of</b> free <b>mica</b> and pure <b>mica</b> material consisting <b>of</b> commercial biotite were studied. Two major parameters were investigated during the research: water storage capacity and specific water saturation value. With the aid of consecutive analytical and statistical analyses a more precise mica presence threshold value for certain unbound applications was indicated, resulting in recommendations for industry, authorities and for future experiments.

Methods: We obtained data on 222 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, including data on MICA expression, age, gender, ECOG score, pathological type, stage, treatment history (including 38 patients who were given autologous CIK cell infusion), and overall survival (OS). MICA expression in lung cancer tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>MICA</b> expression, and CIK therapy association with survival outcomes were performed using Cox proportional models, Kaplan-Meier methods, and the log-rank test. Result: s MICA was expressed in both membrane and cytoplasm. MICA expression correlated with the stage of lung cancer, ECOG score, gender and age. Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the expression <b>of</b> <b>MICA</b> was an independent prognostic factor of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (p = 0. 002).
