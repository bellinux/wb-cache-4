5|$|Waterspouts have a five-part life cycle: {{formation}} of a dark spot on the <b>water</b> <b>surface,</b> spiral pattern on the <b>water</b> <b>surface,</b> {{formation of}} a spray ring, development of the visible condensation funnel, and ultimately decay.|$|E
5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not known}} with {{certainty}} how the spores are dispersed, they may disperse passively in the water, or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float on the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> for dispersal. L.incarnatum is homothallic, a mode of reproduction commonly employed by marine fungi that may confer a competitive advantage in marine environments.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of animal {{locomotion}} on water, determined by the ratio of the animal's weight to the <b>water's</b> <b>surface</b> tension: those whose weight is supported by the surface tension at rest, and can therefore easily remain on the <b>water's</b> <b>surface</b> without much exertion, and those whose weight is not supported by the <b>water's</b> <b>surface</b> tension at rest, and must therefore exert additional motion in a direction parallel to the <b>water's</b> <b>surface</b> in order to remain above it. A creature such as the basilisk lizard, often dubbed the 'Jesus lizard', has a weight which is larger than the surface tension can support, and is widely known for running across the <b>surface</b> of <b>water.</b> Another example, the western grebe, performs a mating ritual that includes running across the <b>surface</b> of <b>water.</b>|$|R

5|$|Predation of sea otters does occur, {{although}} it is not common. Many predators find the otter, with their pungent scent glands, distasteful. Young predators may kill an otter and not eat it. Leading mammalian predators of this species include orcas and sea lions; bald eagles also prey on pups by snatching them from the <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Skimmers are a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> and skimming the water for small fish.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{tension is}} the elastic {{tendency}} of a fluid surface {{which makes it}} acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and stride on a <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

Mountainous, riverine, coastal, glacial and dune, and karst terrain are examined. Educational levels: High school, Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division...|$|R
5|$|Halfbeaks carry several {{adaptations to}} feeding at the <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b> The eyes and {{nostrils}} {{are at the}} top of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{transport}} {{can also}} be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash (pumice and scoria) will float on the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b> They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E

5|$|The hen alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch. The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b> The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has {{completed}} moulting.|$|E
5|$|Within {{much of its}} range, {{the painted}} turtle is the most {{abundant}} turtle species. Population densities range from 10 to 840turtles per hectare (2.5 acres) of <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b> Warmer climates produce higher relative densities among populations, and habitat desirability also influences density. Rivers and large lakes have lower densities because only the shore is desirable habitat; the central, deep waters skew the surface-based estimates. Also, lake and river turtles have to make longer linear trips to access equivalent amounts of foraging space.|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the <b>water</b> <b>surface,</b> and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E

5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> with the lower mandible skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
