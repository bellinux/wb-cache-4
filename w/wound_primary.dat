40|$|Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is the {{histopathological finding}} in chronic lung {{allograft}} rejection. Mounting {{evidence suggests that}} epithelial damage drives the development of airway fibrosis in OB. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 1 expression increases in lung allografts and {{is associated with the}} onset of allograft rejection. Furthermore, in a mouse model of OB, airway obliteration is reduced in TIMP- 1 -deficient mice. Matrilysin (matrix metallproteinase- 7) is essential for airway epithelial repair and is required for the re-epithelialization of airway wounds by facilitating cell migration; therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether TIMP- 1 inhibits re-epithelialization through matrilysin. We found that TIMP- 1 and matrilysin co-localized in the epithelium of human lungs with OB and both co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated in <b>wounded</b> <b>primary</b> airway epithelial cultures. TIMP- 1 -deficient cultures migrated faster, and epithelial cells spread to a greater extent compared with wild-type cultures. TIMP- 1 also inhibited matrilysin-mediated cell migration and spreading in vitro. In vivo, TIMP- 1 deficiency enhanced airway re-epithelialization after naphthalene injury. Furthermore, TIMP- 1 and matrilysin co-localized in airway epithelial cells adjacent to the wound edge. Our data demonstrate that TIMP- 1 interacts with matrix metalloproteinases and regulates matrilysin activity during airway epithelial repair. Furthermore, we speculate that TIMP- 1 overexpression restricts airway re-epithelialization by inhibiting matrilysin activity, contributing to a stereotypic injury response that promotes airway fibrosis via bronchiole airway epithelial damage and obliteration...|$|R
40|$|Open wound {{management}} {{has long been}} the most common practice after appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. Primary closure, however, has recently been advocated to reduce cost and morbidity. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the results of open <b>wound</b> management and <b>primary</b> <b>wound</b> closure in adult patients (age, ≥ 15 years) with perforated appendicitis. Methods: Hospital records of 390 patients (age, ≥ 15 years) who underwent appendectomy between January 2002 and December 2004 were reviewed to identify surgical wound infection (SWI) and pathologic diagnosis. Perforated appendicitis was the indication for appendectomy in 65 of these patients. The incision wounds in these 65 patients were closed primarily in 41 and left open at the end of the operation in 24. The duration of symptoms, white blood cell count, operative time, incidence of SWI, length of stay (LOS) and readmission rate were compared between patients with these two different methods of wound management. Results: Patients whose wounds were closed primarily had a higher incidence of SWI (43. 9 % vs. 4. 2 %, p< 0. 001) and longer LOS (10 days vs. 7. 9 days, p = 0. 044). The readmission rate was also higher for patients whose wounds were closed primarily; however, this difference was not significant. Conclusion: Open wound management may be preferable to <b>primary</b> <b>wound</b> closure for perforated appendicitis in adults because of a lower incidence of SWI and a shorter LOS. Randomized clinical trials, however, are needed to establish these findings...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundGood-quality great {{saphenous vein}} (GSV) is the {{preferred}} conduit for infrainguinal surgical revascularizations, {{but it is not}} available in all patients. We sought to identify the alternative conduit that would maximize cost-effectiveness in the context of infrapopliteal bypass for critical limb ischemia and nonhealing foot wounds. MethodsA Markov model was used to create a detailed simulation of 10 -year outcomes in a hypothetical Edifoligide for the Prevention of Infrainguinal Vein Graft Failure (PREVENT) III-type patient cohort undergoing infrainguinal bypass for nonhealing foot wounds. The following management options were evaluated: (1) conservative therapy (local wound care, amputation as needed); (2) primary amputation; (3) bypass with autologous alternative vein (AAV), including arm or lesser saphenous vein; (4) bypass with GSV < 3 mm in diameter; (5) bypass with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); (6)  cryopreserved venous allograft; and (7) cryopreserved arterial allograft. Estimates of 10 -year total costs were incorporated into the model. Cost-effectiveness was measured in terms of incremental United States dollars per additional year of ambulation. ResultsBypass with AAV had the highest effectiveness as measured in median years of ambulation. After primary amputation, bypass with PTFE had the lowest total costs. With incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $ 5325 and $ 21, 228, bypass with PTFE or AAV appeared to be cost-effective alternatives to conservative therapy for nonhealing ischemic <b>wounds.</b> <b>Primary</b> amputation, GSV < 3 mm, and allograft options were dominated (ie, more costly and less effective).

40|$|We have {{reported}} {{a new phenomenon}} in acute wound healing following the use of intracellular ATP delivery-extremely rapid tissue regeneration, which starts less than 24 h after surgery, and is accompanied by massive macrophage trafficking, in situ proliferation, and direct collagen production. This unusual process bypasses {{the formation of the}} traditional provisional extracellular matrix and significantly shortens the wound healing process. Although macrophages/monocytes are known to {{play a critical role in}} the initiation and progression of wound healing, their in situ proliferation and direct collagen production in wound healing have never been reported previously. We have explored these two very specific pathways during wound healing, while excluding confounding factors in the in vivo environment by analyzing wound samples and performing in vitro studies. The use of immunohistochemical studies enabled the detection of in situ macrophage proliferation in ATP-vesicle treated <b>wounds.</b> <b>Primary</b> human macrophages and Raw 264. 7 cells were used for an in vitro study involving treatment with ATP vesicles, free Mg-ATP alone, lipid vesicles alone, Regranex, or culture medium. Collagen type 1 α 1, MCP- 1, IL- 6, and IL- 10 levels were determined by ELISA of the culture supernatant. The intracellular collagen type 1 α 1 localization was determined with immunocytochemistry. ATP-vesicle treated wounds showed high immunoreactivity towards BrdU and PCNA antigens, indicating in situ proliferation. Most of the cultured macrophages treated with ATP-vesicles maintained their classic phenotype and expressed high levels of collagen type 1 α 1 for a longer duration than was observed with cells treated with Regranex. These studies provide the first clear evidence of in situ macrophage proliferation and direct collagen production during wound healing. These findings provide part of the explanation for the extremely rapid tissue regeneration, and this treatment may hold promise for acute and chronic wound care...|$|R
