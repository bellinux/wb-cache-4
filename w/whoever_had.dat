5|$|<b>Whoever</b> <b>had</b> joy or gladness, Troilus {{suffered}} affliction and grief. That was for {{the daughter}} of Calchas, for he loved her deeply. He had set his whole heart on her; so mightily was he possessed by his love that he thought only of her. She had given herself to him, both her body and her love. Most men knew of that.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision {{was that it would}} be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E
25|$|To avoid {{bad feeling}} over billing, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam were alternated {{in the opening}} credits, so that one week Bewes was billed first and the {{following}} week Bolam was. In the closing credits the billing was reversed, with <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> been billed second in the opening credits being billed first.|$|E

25|$|Civil {{wars in the}} 19th {{century and}} in the early 20th century tended to be short; civil wars between 1900 and 1944 lasted on average one and half years. The state itself formed the obvious center of {{authority}} in the majority of cases, and the civil wars were thus fought for control of the state. This meant that <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> control of the capital and the military could normally crush resistance. A rebellion which failed to quickly seize the capital and control of the military for itself normally found itself doomed to rapid destruction. For example, the fighting associated with the 1871 Paris Commune occurred almost entirely in Paris, and ended quickly once the military sided with the government at Versailles and conquered Paris.|$|E
25|$|Special rules apply as {{two teams}} {{will have the}} same number. The fastest lap time in {{qualifying}} determines which team will have the number for the race, and which team must temporarily change the number for the race. For example, during the 1991 Busch Series season, there were selected races in the Northeast (Loudon, Nazareth, Dover, Oxford) where both the Busch Grand National (now Xfinity) and Busch Grand National North (now K Pro East) Series raced in combination races. North team Ricky Craven (also drove his car) and Grand National team Don Beverly Racing (Jimmy Hensley driving) both used No. 25. <b>Whoever</b> <b>had</b> the faster qualifying time in each race used No. 25. Craven used No. 28 at Oxford when Hensley had the faster time, while Hensley used No. 5 when Craven had the faster time at Loudon. Both teams, however, scored respective owner points for the No. 25 in their respective series.|$|E
25|$|Many non-academic sources claim a {{government}} sniper killed Saad; however, {{there is no}} evidence to support such a claim, and it appears that <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> killed him had intended that what began as a small and quiet demonstration to evolve into something more. The sniper targeted Saad right at the end of the demonstration as it was dissipating. Farid Khazen, sourcing the local histories of Sidon academics and eyewitnesses, gives a run-down of the puzzling events of the day that based on their research. Other interesting facts that Khazen reveals, based on the Sidon academic's work including that Saad was not in dispute with the fishing consortium made up of Yugoslav nationals. In fact, the Yugoslavian representatives in Lebanon had negotiated with the fisherman's union to make the fisherman shareholders in the company; the company offered to modernize the Fisherman's equipment and buy their catch, give their fisherman's a union and annual subsidy. Saad, as a union representative (and not the mayor of Sidon at the time as many erroneous sources claim), was offered a place on the company's board too. There has been some speculation that Saad's attempts to narrow the differences between the fishermen and the consortium, and his acceptance of a place on the board made him a target of attack by the conspirator who sought a full conflagration around the small protest. The events in Sidon were not contained for long. The government began to lose control of the situation in 1975.|$|E

500|$|The Robots' Rebellion {{was greeted}} with dismay by the Green Party's executive. Despite the {{controversy}} over the press conference and the Wogan interview, they had allowed Icke to address the party's annual conference in 1992—a decision that led one of its principal speakers, Sara Parkin, to resign—but after the publication of The Robot's Rebellion they moved to ban him. Icke wrote to The Guardian in September 1994 denying that The Robots' Rebellion was antisemitic, and rejecting racism, sexism and prejudice of any kind, while insisting that <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> written the Protocols [...] "knew the game plan" [...] for the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Henry VIII {{ascended the}} English throne in 1509 {{at the age}} of 17. He made a dynastic {{marriage}} with Catherine of Aragon, widow of his brother Arthur, in June 1509, just before his coronation on Midsummer's Day. Unlike his father, who was secretive and conservative, the young Henry appeared the epitome of chivalry and sociability. An observant Roman Catholic, he heard up to five masses a day (except during the hunting season); of [...] "powerful but unoriginal mind", he let himself be influenced by his advisors from whom he was never apart, by night or day.

[...] Boghardt comments that [...] "his eagerness to display his honour may indicate a concern that others doubted this very quality in him. While presenting himself to the world as a man of honour and accepting his fate courageously, Lody may have found comfort and strength in the thought that <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> doubted his honour previously would now be persuade otherwise." ...|$|E

His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR, and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the CIA interviewed German rocket scientists who were {{allowed to return to}} Germany, and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA. The Russians considered that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons; they believed that <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> superiority in these weapons would take over the world, without necessarily using them.

500|$|The team {{continued}} their resurgence into the 2006 season, finishing {{with a record}} of 13–3. During the season, Urlacher had one of the best performances of his professional career against the Arizona Cardinals. He helped the Bears overcome a 20-point deficit by recording 19 tackles and a forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Teammate Devin Hester commented on Urlacher's performance, stating, [...] "We watched the film and everybody was saying that he just turned into the Incredible Hulk the last four minutes of the game, just killing people and running over and tackling <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> the ball." [...] The Bears won the NFC Championship against the New Orleans Saints, 39–14, but lost Super Bowl XLI to the Indianapolis Colts, 29–17. Urlacher finished the season with 93 tackles and three forced fumbles. He was elected to the 2006 All-Pro Team and 2007 Pro Bowl, while also earning consideration for the League's Defensive Player of the Year award.|$|E

2500|$|The bankers {{also began}} issuing a greater value of notes {{than the total}} value of their {{physical}} reserves in the form of loans, on the assumption that they wouldn't have to redeem all of their issued banknotes at the same time. This pivotal shift changed the simple promissory note into an agency for the expansion of the monetary supply itself. As these receipts were increasingly used in the money circulation system, depositors began to ask for multiple receipts to be made out in smaller, fixed denominations for use as money. The receipts soon became a written order to pay the amount to <b>whoever</b> <b>had</b> possession of the note. These notes are credited as the first modern banknotes.|$|E
