To this hour I cannot quite answer the question, though I believe the explanation to be that she did really care for me, and was anxious not to involve me in trouble and her plottings; also {{she may have been}} wise enough to see that our natures were as oil and water and would never blend.|$|E

And then, you {{looked up at me}} so coldly, and you thanked me for finding your ring in such an indifferent manner, that my knees trembled under me, and I felt as if I should drop on the floor at your feet. When you had thanked me, you looked back, if you remember, at your writing. I was so mortified at being treated in this way, that I plucked up spirit enough to speak. I said, 'This is a strange thing about the Diamond, sir.' And you looked up again, and said, 'Yes, it is!' You spoke civilly (I can't deny that); but still you kept a distance--a cruel distance between us. Believing, as I did, that you had got the lost Diamond hidden about you, while you were speaking, your coolness so provoked me that I got bold enough, {{in the heat of the}} moment, to give you a hint. I said, 'They will never find the Diamond, sir, will they? No! nor the person who took it--I'll answer for that.' I nodded, and smiled at you, as much as to say, 'I know!' THIS time, you looked up at me with something like interest in your eyes; and I felt that a few more words on your side and mine might bring out the truth. Just at that moment, Mr. Betteredge spoilt it all by coming to the door. I knew his footstep, and I also knew that it was against his rules for me to be in the library at that time of day--let alone being there along with you. I had only just time to get out of my own accord, before he could come in and tell me to go. I was angry and disappointed; but I was not entirely without hope for all that.

A jingle company had used it on a session and in walked a couple of guys from SIR Instruments Rental to haul it away. I asked them to take a lunch break and told Bruce to put a couple of mics on it. He was whining that it was out of tune, but I asked him to let me try something. I added two tracks of harpsichord, told the movers they could remove it, walked into Jerry's office and asked if I could borrow the electric bass that was sitting on his couch, played that on just the second verse and the outro, and that was that! Radio compression worked in our favor on that record. It made the harpsichord blend with the two guitars in an unusual way. But we thought this record would only be an album cut." ...|$|E

40|$|The United States is in {{the middle}} of a {{significant}} cultural shift. Until very recently, United States citizens and policy-makers were willing to accept, or at least tolerate, what has become our food status quo [...] a highly subsidized, centralized, industrial food system that is environmentally harmful and unsustainable and encourages unhealthy eating habits. Many citizens and policy-makers are now demanding that we re-evaluate our entire agricultural system from farm to table and look for ways to develop a new food paradigm that is environmentally sound, sustainable, socially equitable, and that makes healthy whole foods available to all. During the summer of 2010, I taught a course titled 2 ̆ 2 Agricultural Policy and the Environment 2 ̆ 2 at Vermont Law School. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> classroom on the first day I was shocked to see almost fifty students in the class. I taught the same course the year before and had approximately twenty-five students in the class. Although I cannot be sure, I think that if I taught the same course ten years ago I would be lucky to have enough students register to avoid having the course cancelled. Not only did the 2010 course have a very large enrollment, but the students who were in the course were extremely interested and engaged and brought with them a broad range of relevant experience. Some had grown up on farms in various parts of the country while others had chosen to work on organic farms as teenagers or adults. Some students had previously or were currently working on agricultural or food policy matters through a variety of organizations such as land trusts and in a variety of capacities such as being a social worker. Many others, while not having as much direct experience, had learned a great deal about agricultural and food policy through other formal education or independently. The widespread interest in agricultural issues at Vermont Law School mirrors the renewed interest in food policy by the public in general. Unquestionably, many factors contribute to this cultural shift to local foods, including a desire to feel more connected to the land and to interact more with our communities. However, certainly a major factor is the public 2 ̆ 7 s growing awareness that our current industrialized food system has failed us with regard to the health of both our diets and the environment...|$|E

Certainly I heard a good deal of {{shuffling}} <b>when</b> first <b>I</b> reached the landing outside the door; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> actually <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the apartment with an air of quiet unconcern Theodore was sprawling on the chair-bedstead, with eyes closed, a nose the colour of beetroot, and emitting sounds through his thin, cracked lips which I could not, Sir, describe graphically in your presence.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2014, Onwurah {{spoke in}} a {{parliamentary}} debate she had called on gender-specific toy marketing and lent her support to the campaign Let Toys Be Toys. In her speech to the House of Commons, she said:"Before entering Parliament, I spent two decades as a professional engineer, working across three continents. Regardless of where I was or {{the size of the}} company, it was always a predominantly male, or indeed all-male, environment, but it is only <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a toy shop that I feel I am really experiencing gender segregation."She later told Kira Cochrane of The Guardian, that she believes the limiting of children by gender stereotypes is a serious economic issue, with the proportion of female students on engineering degree courses having fallen from 12% to 8% in the thirty years since she had started studying for one herself. Referring to a shortage of engineers and the UK having [...] "the lowest proportion in Europe of women who are professional engineers" [...] she said [...] "toys are so important and formative, and for me this is about the jobs of the future, about what happens in 10 or 15 years' time. We can't go on with a segregated society." ...|$|R
40|$|To {{borrow from}} (and modify) Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music, “when a door closes, a window opens. ” That {{is exactly what}} {{happened}} one day in December 2003 <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> Bill Rapaport’s office looking for a new advisor. <b>I</b> was pleased <b>when</b> Bill agreed to take me on as a challenge. Soon I discovered that the window I had jumped through would change everything. My experience working on this dissertation was very different than the dreary picture of drudgery and turmoil that I had in my mind. In fact, Bill taught me more about the process of a dissertation, writing, researching, and expressing my ideas than I ever thought possible. I had often heard rather half-heartedly that a dissertation was an “apprenticeship, ” but I can truly say that my experience has been just that. I am extremely grateful for all of the help and guidance he has given me. I can only hope that I can be as good a mentor to someone else one day as he has been to me. My committee member Carl Alphonce, has provided me with valuable insight while on my committee and also as a collaborator on several projects. If not for those other projects, I might have completed this dissertation sooner. Our collaborations have bee...|$|R
40|$|From {{one point}} of view my {{studying}} economics {{was the result of}} accidental blind chance. Prior to graduating from high school I was born again at 8 : 00 a. m., January 2, 1932, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the University of Chicago lecture hall. That day's lecture was on Malthus's theory that human populations would reproduce like rabbits until their density per acre of land reduced their wage to a bare subsistence level where an increased death rate came to equal the birth rate. So easy was it to understand all this simple differential equation stuff that I suspected (wrongly) that I was missing out on some mysterious complexity. autobiography...|$|R
