25|$|Duel Live {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the 2008 Scarefest event. Throughout this period, the park's haunted house dark ride, Duel, became host to this attraction, which included live actors situated around the ride circuit. Duel was available to ride normally until 12pm, when the laser guns and LED targets were switched and the actors took their positions. This was changed in 2009, when Duel Live took place throughout the whole day and many more actors than the previous year were present. Duel Live was aimed at the family audience, and included such features as new music playing throughout the ride (instead of the usual Duel theme music), {{as well as a}} butler or maid who would <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> inside the house. The attraction was changed slightly for the 2010 season and featured the park's Scarefest mascots.|$|E
