The {{root of the}} problems has two aspects: First, the actuality of education system affects current art education; second, the lag of art education development affects current art education. Chinese art education has the only one way out——the eco-style art education that has the fundamental characters of intercourse and dialogue. </p...|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} seven {{companies}} began the development of USB in 1994: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. The goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors {{at the back of}} PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB, as well as permitting greater data rates for external devices. A team including Ajay Bhatt worked on the standard at Intel; the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in 1995.|$|E
5|$|After winning Miss India World, Chopra {{was cast}} as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), in which she <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the {{production}} conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in The Hindu was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Alex Funke, {{who worked}} on The Lord of the Rings, {{directed}} the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th and 1/100th scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A scale model was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against. One of the improvements made over the previous film <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers (mechanical stilts with springs), to mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped {{and had to be}} revamped digitally.|$|E
30|$|The {{fourth step}} is {{requirements}} validation. The first {{task of the}} validation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the formed requirements define the right system. That <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that requirements truly correspond to stakeholders' intentions before resources <b>are</b> committed <b>to</b> development. The second task of the validation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an assessment whether the requirements are feasible. Traditional techniques for validation include reviews of requirements documents and building early system models and prototypes.|$|R

5|$|Concepts for an MMORPG {{within the}} Dragon Quest series began among a small team during the later {{development}} of Dragon Quest VIII. Development progressed alongside that of Dragon Quest IX. The aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it accessible to series fans and newcomers alike, along with creating a long-term content plan. The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama. New staff members included producer Yosuke Saito, {{who had previously}} worked on the Drakengard series and whose company Orca helped with development; and Chikara Saito, who joined as co-director in 2013.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and the plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.'

5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E

When asked about his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his first instinct <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|On 26 October, {{units of}} the 75th Division raided Outpost Hill. Then, just hours after the capture of Beersheba, on 1 November, a second raid by five {{officers}} and 220 riflemen of the 3/3rd Gurkhas Rifles (233rd Brigade 75th Division) was carried out against Outpost Hill. At 03:00, under cover of an intense bombardment, they entered the Ottoman defences on the hill; two Gurkhas were killed and twenty-three wounded. During the fighting, they killed twenty-eight Ottoman soldiers and captured sixteen, before returning to their lines. The division <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> another attack during the next night, (1/2 November) towards Atawineh Redoubt, on the Gaza to Beersheba road.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the things}} that Spector wanted to achieve in Deus Ex <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create a}} better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Otto's early reign {{was also}} notable for his moving {{the capital of}} Greece from Nafplion to Athens. His first task as king <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{detailed}} archaeological and topographic survey of Athens. He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to complete this task. At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000–5,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of Plaka in Athens.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the draft, the Texas Rangers {{held the}} second lowest {{attendance}} in the American League, ahead {{of only the}} Cleveland Indians despite having Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager at one point. They had moved from Washington, D.C., two years prior, and owner Bob Short expanded Arlington Stadium an extra 20,000 seats. Short was looking {{for some sort of}} way to boost attendance, and found it using fellow Texas native Clyde.
