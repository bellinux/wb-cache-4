6000|$|One morning, {{about two}} weeks after Charley's arrival at Red River, Harry Somerville found himself alone in Mr Kennedy's parlour. The old gentleman himself had just galloped away in the {{direction}} of the lower fort, to visit Charley, who was now formally installed there; Kate was busy in the kitchen, giving directions about dinner; and Jacques was away with Redfeather, visiting his numerous friends in the settlement: so that, for the first time since his arrival, Harry found himself at the hour of ten in the morning utterly lone, and with nothing very definite to do. Of course, the two weeks that had elapsed were not without their signs and symptoms, their minor accidents and incidents, in regard to the subject that filled his thoughts. Harry had fifty times been tossed alternately from the height of hope to the depth of despair, from the extreme of felicity to the uttermost verge of sorrow, and he began seriously to reflect, when he remembered his desperate resolution on the first night of his arrival, that if he did not [...] "do" [...] he certainly would [...] "die." [...] This was quite a mistake, however, on Harry's part. Nobody ever did die of unrequited love. Doubtless many people have hanged, drowned, and shot themselves because of it; but, generally speaking, if the patient can be kept from maltreating himself long enough, time will prove to be an infallible remedy. O youthful reader, lay this to heart; but, pshaw! why do I <b>waste</b> <b>ink</b> on so hopeless a task? Every one, we suppose, resolves once in a way to die of love; so--die away, my young friends, only make sure that you don't kill yourselves, and I've no fear of the result.|$|E

The goal {{of this study was to}} identify waste minimization techniques available to printers. It includes a set of checklists that can be used by printers to perform their own waste audit. Three commercial printing plants were audited. Current waste minimization and printing literature was reviewed. Meetings with a major printing trade association were held. As a result, a number of waste minimization techniques were identified. Source reduction, recycling, and resource recovery offer great potential in reducing waste for printers. In particular, good operating practices, proper material handling and storage, recycling of <b>waste</b> <b>inks,</b> and recovery of silver from photoprocessing. wastes are important. The main benefits of these techniques are lower waste disposal costs and reduced input materials purchases. It is recommended that this report and the self-audit checklists be provided to the printing industry. A second recommendation is that the printing industry and ink manufacturers determine whether their inks are hazardous and devote efforts to developing nonhazardous inks. A third recommendation is that a printer who coul...|$|R
5000|$|There were {{a number}} of controversies {{surrounding}} the project. One controversy was the environmental issues associated with the resources used to print out the internet. When Goldsmith announced his project, Printing out the Internet, people expressed concern with the potential environmental impact that the project may have. [...] Goldsmith announced that he plans to recycle the paper after the exhibit, but there are environmental impacts that the act of printing of the Internet would have. Logging, manufacturing, and transportation of paper all require energy and produce carbon dioxide emissions. Trees also help to sequester carbon dioxide, acting as carbon sinks, and cutting down trees increases carbon dioxide emissions and decreases the amount of carbon that can be sequestered from the atmosphere. Printing itself uses energy, which also produces carbon emissions. Environmentalists are concerned with the contribution of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, to global warming. Also, there is waste generated from non-paper products, such as plastic and <b>ink</b> <b>waste</b> from <b>ink</b> cartridges.|$|R

When it touched ourselves (truly in a vile shape), we proved false to the imaginations; discovered, in a clap, that crime was no less cruel and no less ugly under sounding names; and recoiled from our false deities.|$|R

Above and Beyond a reasoned vineyard management, Duval-Leroy has developed a precise program of wine growing taking into consideration environmental and statutory constraints. Measures to combat the run-off of rain water and limit pollution; measures to combat erosion, and measures to preserve natural diversity through the restoration of ecological niches have all been implemented in the past twenty years. The use of weed killers in the vineyard has been cut by over fifty percent since the year 2000. Water consumption has been lowered by 30%. Likewise the use of phytosanitary products intended to protect the vineyard has been limited and work methods have been optimized to limit the use of such products in as much as it is possible. Duval-Leroy has invested in renewable energies to power its new winery. The tasting room, reception areas, as well as the oak barrel room where the wine is set to rest are now lit and heated by solar panels. A green wall, comprising over 2500 plants, brings insulation from both heat and sound for this space, providing the cool and quiet necessary for quality wine making. Finally a waste management policy has been in place for over ten years insuring that, wine by products as well as office generated <b>waste,</b> such as <b>ink,</b> paper, cardboard, etc., are all recycled.|$|R
40|$|A touch sensing {{material}} called QTC {{is currently}} produced by Peratech Ltd. The material {{is a composite}} with conducting particles in a polymer matrix. When a pressure {{is applied to the}} composite the conductivity rises sharply. By using this property, the QTC surface can tell where and how much pressure is applied onto a surface. QTC {{can be used as a}} 3 D touch screens, sensing robot hand and so on. Currently QTC surfaces are produced by screen printing which is a costly technique due to the batch wise, slow and non automated process and also due to its high <b>waste</b> of <b>ink.</b> Another method of printing conductive surfaces or pattern is inkjet printing. It is a digitally controlled deposition of ink droplets and the jetted pattern can be easily controlled by the printer software. Inkjet printing gives no or low waste and can print several inks simultaneously. The inkjet ink, compared to the screen printing paste, has to be low viscous and has to contain small particle sizes and no aggregates to avoid blocking the print head. The dispersion of particles in the inkjet ink is therefore of great importance. In this work two types of conductive particles were used, so called K 2 and K 1. K 2 is currently used in the QTC screen printing paste. K 1 particles are slightly smaller but of the same type. The particle size of K 2 had to be reduced to be inkjet printable and it was done with a bead mill. The products, though, did not meet the requirements for inkjet printing. The smaller K 1 particles were mixed with binder, dispersing agents and additives and were then bead milled. Before printing, the inks were filtered and characterized, to make sure that they met the requirements for viscosity, surface tension and particles sizes. The printing was done with two printers, HP Deskjet 5650 and Printos P 16 Digital Textile Printer and the experiments showed that the Printos printer was suited to print this ink. The touch sensing property of the printed surfaces was investigated by measuring the conductivity of the surfaces when different pressures were applied. Experiments showed that the touch sensing property could be controlled by changing the amount of binder in the ink. The developed ink could be successfully inkjet printed and was highly touch sensing. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

6000|$|So, how thin {{often is}} the hedge! And how poor a {{business}} the partisan abuse of either {{kind of art}} {{in a world where}} each sort of mind has full right to its own due expression, and grumbling lawful only when due expression is not attained. One may not care for a Rembrandt portrait of a plain old woman; a graceful Watteau decoration may leave another cold but foolish will he be who denies that both are faithful to their conceiving moods, and so proportioned part to part, and part to whole, as to have, each in its own way, that inherent rhythm or vitality which is the hall-mark of Art. He is but a poor philosopher who holds a view so narrow as to exclude forms not to his personal taste. No realist can love romantic Art so much as he loves his own, but when that Art fulfils the laws of its peculiar being, if he would be no blind partisan, he must admit it. The romanticist will never be amused by realism, but let him not for that reason be so parochial as to think that realism, when it achieves vitality, is not Art. For what is Art but the perfected expression of self in contact with the world; and whether that self be of enlightening, or of fairy-telling temperament, is of no moment whatsoever. The tossing of abuse from realist to romanticist and back is but the sword-play of two one-eyed men with their blind side turned toward each other. Shall not each attempt be judged on its own merits? If found not shoddy, faked, or forced, but true to itself, true to its conceiving mood, and fair-proportioned part to whole; so that it lives--then, realistic or romantic, in the name of Fairness let it pass!

30|$|Lab scale {{infiltration}} of both cathode and anodes {{has been demonstrated}} by various groups [9, 10] in laboratory conditions. The infiltration is usually performed with micro pipette drop delivery or sample immersion. The procedure often involves several loading steps with intermediate vacuum treatments to increase the mass load of the infiltrate. An appropriate heat treatment is performed after each step to form either a nanodecoration composed of discrete nanoparticles or interconnected nanoparticle coverage on the electrode scaffold. The process is cumbersome and slow resulting in non-uniform ink distribution (both lateral and in-depth) and <b>waste</b> of expensive <b>ink.</b> Liu et al. [11] infiltrated 1  M water based inks of Sm doped ceria (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 —SDC) into laboratory produced anode-supported button cells (NiO-SDC/SDC/Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3) with an SDC electrolyte densification temperature of 1250  °C. The ink was manually dropped onto the porous anode under vacuum and the infiltration was driven by capillary action. After drying, the pellets were fired at 800  °C for 2  h to decompose the nitrate salts and form corresponding metal oxides. Different loading levels were achieved by repeating the infiltration cycle. It was demonstrated that the cell performances at 600  °C in humidified H 2 changes with SDC loading. Loadings of 0.96  mmol cm− 3 (two infiltration cycles) and 1.41  mmol cm− 3 (three sequential infiltration cycles) led to an increase of the maximum power output by 8 and 22 %, respectively. Timurkutluk et al. [12] infiltrated gadolinium doped ceria (CGO) precursor ink into the anode and cathode of NiO-ScSZ/ScSZ/LSF-ScSZ button cells. After five infiltration passes {{it was found that}} at 700  °C the cell impregnated with 1.5  M solution provides peak power density of 1.34  W cm− 2 compared to the cell without impregnation producing only 0.78  W cm− 2. They also noticed that infiltration with more concentrated precursor solutions reduced power output due to a reduction in open porosity. Sholklapper et al. [13] reported that {{infiltration of}} SDC into a composite NiO-ScSZ anode led not only to an increase in fuel electrode performance (from 348 to 403  mW cm− 2) but more importantly to a significant increase in sulphur tolerance. Single step infiltration of the cathode of commercially available cells has been reported by Dowd et al. [14]. They could load ~ 8 – 10  wt% La 0.6 Sr 0.4 CoO 3 -d (LSCo) into a composite LSCF/SDC cathode that had a thickness of ~ 50 – 60  μm in a single step using an ultrasonic spray nozzle. The samples showed improved power performance and increased durability at 200  h operation compared to a reference. Jiang [15] provided a comprehensive review of the benefits and challenges facing infiltrated SOFC electrodes. Based on data from various authors the improved performances of the anodes infiltrated with mixed conducting oxides could be attributed to the extension of TPB as well as enhanced catalytic activities of the anodes.|$|R
