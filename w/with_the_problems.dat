5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese {{positions}} around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|The Rush vs. Trickett match {{attracted}} {{the largest number}} of spectators ever before gathered at a Sydney sporting event, and the event is part of Australian sporting history. Estimates {{of the size of the}} crowd range from 30,000 to 70,000. Shops and government offices closed for the event, special trains brought people into the city. Steam-ships carrying spectators accompanied the competing champions, and hundreds of smaller, private vessels crowded the river. Special Regulations were published by the Marine Board of the NSW Government to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of regulating maritime traffic during the event.|$|E

5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear {{reports that the}} point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E

5|$|Anglo-Saxon kings ruled through ealdormen, who had {{the highest}} lay status under the king. In ninth-century Wessex they each ruled a single shire, but {{by the middle of}} the tenth they had {{authority}} over a much wider area, a change probably introduced by Æthelstan to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of governing his extended realm. One of the ealdormen, who was also called Æthelstan, governed the eastern Danelaw territory of East Anglia, the largest and wealthiest province of England. After the king's death, he became so powerful that he was known as Æthelstan Half-King. Several of the ealdormen who witnessed charters had Scandinavian names, and while the localities they came from cannot be identified, they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led Danish armies in the time of Edward the Elder, and who were retained by Æthelstan as his representatives in local government.|$|E

5|$|Between the wars, Krueger {{served in}} a number of command and staff positions, and {{attended}} the Naval War College at his own request. In 1941, he assumed command of the Third Army, which he led in the Louisiana Maneuvers. He expected, in view of his age, to spend the war at home training troops, but in 1943 he was sent to General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area as commander of the Sixth Army and Alamo Force, which he led in a series of victorious campaigns against the Japanese. As an army commander, Krueger had to grapple <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> imposed by vast distances, inhospitable terrain, unfavorable climate, and an indefatigable and dangerous enemy. He had to balance MacArthur's need to speed up the tempo of operations in order to win campaigns with the more cautious approach of subordinates who often found themselves confronted by unexpectedly large numbers of Japanese troops. In the Battle of Luzon in 1945, his largest, longest and last battle, he was finally able to maneuver his army as he had in 1941 against a Japanese army under Tomoyuki Yamashita.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> he encounters, and dealing with them often {{involves}} the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E
5|$|English Poor Law {{legislation}} can {{be traced}} back as far as 1536, when legislation was passed to deal with the impotent poor, although there is much earlier Tudor legislation dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> caused by vagrants and beggars. The history of the Poor Law in England and Wales is usually divided between two statutes, the Old Poor Law passed during the reign of Elizabeth I and the New Poor Law, passed in 1834, which significantly modified the existing system of poor relief. The later statute altered the Poor Law system from one which was administered haphazardly at a local parish level to a highly centralised system which encouraged the large-scale development of workhouses by Poor Law Unions.|$|E

5|$|Foliot {{was elected}} to the see of Hereford in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174 at Canterbury by Archbishop Richard of Dover. Hereford had been vacant since the death of Robert of Melun in 1167, due to the Becket's exile and then death. Foliot was either elected by the cathedral chapter without {{guidance}} from the king, or was nominated to the cathedral chapter by King Henry at the urging of his relative Gilbert Foliot. Robert Foliot later attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. While bishop, he became involved in a disupte with Hugh Parvus, a local baron, over the power of appointment to two churches. He also served as a judge-delegate for the papacy, serving with Roger, the Bishop of Worcester on cases including one between a Norman monastery and an English priory. He judged a number of other cases for the papacy during his time as bishop. He received over 40 surviving papal commissions and communications, some of which dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> of married clergy in his diocese. From his ecclesiastical documents, almost 40 survive.|$|E
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E

Following the suicide of an outwardly successful neighbor, her friends begin to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> in their personal lives. Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) competes for the attention of a new plumber who has moved across the street; Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross) struggles with her failing marriage and ungrateful family; Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) continues an affair with her sixteen-year-old gardener; and Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) copes with life as a stay-at-home mother of four.|$|E
