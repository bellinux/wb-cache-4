50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.|$|R

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more {{complicated}} than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six <b>were</b> <b>converted,</b> two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E
