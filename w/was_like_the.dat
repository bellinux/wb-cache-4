5|$|Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours, Williams {{served as}} Staff Officer, Aviation, at Australian Imperial Force (AIF) {{headquarters}} in London, {{before returning to}} Australia and taking up the position of Director of Air Services at Army Headquarters, Melbourne. The Australian Flying Corps had meanwhile been disbanded and replaced by the Australian Air Corps (AAC) which <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> AFC, {{a branch of the}} Army.|$|E
5|$|Princess Alice was {{the mother}} of Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia (wife of Tsar Nicholas II), {{maternal}} grandmother of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the last Viceroy of India, and maternal great-grandmother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Queen Elizabeth II. Another daughter, Elisabeth, who married Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tsaritsa and her family, killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>The</b> opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa. The elder Camet, though officially an athlete from France, is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Argentina's first Olympic participant. This is disputed, however, by those who claim that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career. Carlos, who served as a deputy to the national congress, <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rest of his family, supportive of the Radical Civil Union, an Argentine political reform party formed in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Battalion <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 8th Battalion, also {{initially}} {{raised as}} a training battalion, and {{was assigned to}} the 224th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). The 9th Battalion was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps in December 1941, becoming 154th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, retaining their North Staffords cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps, as did all other infantry units converted in this way. The regiment was assigned to 36th Army Tank Brigade alongside RAC regiments converted from infantry battalions. However, the regiment was disbanded in July 1943.|$|E

5|$|The game's logo artwork {{was drawn}} by regular series artist Yoshitaka Amano. The kanji symbol {{used in the}} logo was drawn by Naora, who had {{designed}} the Shinra logo in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>The</b> island of the Vermillion Perystilium {{was based on an}} offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
5|$|Tobe Hooper, then {{preparing}} both Invaders From Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, was mooted as director. Golan and Globus misunderstood {{the concept}} of the character ("They thought it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Wolf Man", said director Joseph Zito) and instructed writer Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, to write a treatment reflecting their misconception. In Stevens' story, a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID-badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment, transforming him into a hairy, suicidal, eight-armed monster. This human tarantula refuses to join the scientist’s new master-race of mutants, battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|With Anderson serving chiefly as {{executive}} producer, {{the majority of}} the writing input for Captain Scarlet was provided by Tony Barwick, who had previously written for the short-lived second season of Thunderbirds. Originally given the role of script editor, Barwick went on to pen 18 of the 32 episodes himself, and was also often required to make substantial changes to other writers' work. While discussing his approach to writing episodes in a 1986 interview, he drew parallels between the premise and characters of Captain Scarlet and those of Thunderbirds, suggesting, for example, that Spectrum was similar to International Rescue and that the character of Captain Black <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> earlier recurring villain from Thunderbirds, The Hood.|$|E
5|$|Peter K. Bol {{asserts that}} the {{supporters}} of Wang Anshi's expansionist, activist central government in his New Policies were convinced that he understood the dao which brought utopia to Western Zhou (c. 1050 BC – 771 BC) antiquity and were determined to conform society according to his vision. The marginalised emperor – the last remaining aristocrat with any true political power – embraced the fiction that he <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sage kings of old who brought society {{into a state of}} total harmony with court rituals and policy reforms. Yet after the reign of Emperor Huizong, Song rulers and officials alike disregarded the New Policies and focused instead on reforming society through a local, bottom-up approach. For example, Emperor Huizong attempted from 1107–1120 to bar anyone who had not attended a government school from serving in public office. He thus rejected anyone who did not acknowledge his brand of Confucian ideology as orthodoxy. However, the government-run school system during the Southern Song eventually lost prominence to private academies, which had outnumbered government schools during the early Northern Song. Even before Emperor Huizong's reign, Sima Guang (1019–1086), a prominent chancellor and political rival to Wang Anshi, had little to say about the emperor's role in shaping major reforms and public policy, mentioning only that the emperor made major appointments when necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi {{interpreted}} {{this story}} as such: [...] "The wine <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> wilderness — fermentation requires wild, airborne yeast. <b>The</b> bread <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> settled land — bread is created through cultivation and human intervention. Salt <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ocean — the sea, where life began and purity begins." [...] These {{are the three}} realms {{of the world and}} are framework of what unifies the altar within the Jewish home. Thus through the Sabbath blessing over wine and Challah, the covenant with God is manifested.|$|R
5|$|The design main {{armament}} for the Type 1936A (Mob) class <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Type 1936A {{class on}} which it was based, five 15 cm (5.9in) TbtsK C/36 naval guns, with one twin turret forward and three single mounts aft. Development of the twin turret was slow however, and Z31 (like all the Type 1936A class), was completed with an additional single 15cm gun replacing the unavailable twin turret, giving {{a total of four}} 15cm guns. The forward gun was replaced by the intended twin turret in 1944, but the twin turret was replaced by a single 10.5 cm (4.1in) SK L/45 naval gun after the twin turret was wrecked in battle in January 1945. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of 2 twin 3.7 cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns (later replaced by automatic Flak M42 guns) and nine 20 mm cannon in one quadruple and five single mounts. A second quadruple 20mm mount was fitted forward of the ship's bridge in 1943, replacing one of the single mounts, while additional 3.7cm were fitted in 1945, giving a final anti-aircraft armament in German service of fourteen 3.7cm and twelve 20mm guns. Eight 533mm (21in) torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts were fitted, and up to 60 mines could be carried.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

Columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing that it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> NAB curve in the treble, but had more bass boost or pre-emphasis below 200Hz. The authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the Columbia LP curve. This was the first such curve based on formulae.|$|E

The Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC), ENIAC, and Colossus all used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus.|$|E
