Good solidity of hue and depth is more critical in 50 : 50 blends and in union fabrics, such as nylon <b>warp</b> <b>stretch</b> fabrics, containing cotton or nylon/cotton wefts for swim wear and narrow fabrics, crimped nylon warp/viscose filament dress wear, or cotton warp/nylon weft constructions for uniforms, rain wear or work wear. Cotton/nylon {{is also used}} in socks. Nylon being a polyamide contains many amide groups in its structure. It also contains free amine groups {{at the ends of}} its polymeric chains, although the number of these free amine groups is less than the number of carboxylic groups, and the fiber possesses a negative charge unless in the appropriate pH region (Haji et al. 2014). These amine groups provide excellent electrostatic and hydrogen bonding sites and are the main factors contributing to the substantively of the dye molecules. Acid dyes have very little affinity for cotton, but cationic cotton can be dyed readily with acid dyes. The ammonium groups act as dye sites (Run-ling 2010).|$|E

50|$|An {{anamorphic}} stretch transform (AST) {{also referred to}} as <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> transform is a physics-inspired signal transform that emerged from time stretch dispersive Fourier transform. The transform can be applied to analog temporal signals such as communication signals, or to digital spatial data such as images. The transform reshapes the data {{in such a way that}} its output has properties conducive for data compression and analytics. The reshaping consists of <b>warped</b> <b>stretching</b> in Fourier domain. The name “Anamorphic” is used because of the metaphoric analogy between the <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> operation and <b>warping</b> of images in anamorphosis and surrealist artworks.|$|R

50|$|Anamorphic (<b>warped)</b> <b>stretch</b> {{transform}} is a physics-based mathematical {{operation that}} reduces the signal bandwidth without proportionally increasing {{the size of the}} signal, thus providing space-bandwidth product compression.

50|$|Similar to the {{simplified}} reconstruction approach {{above mentioned}} above, a digital implementation for image compression which uses direct warping {{has also been}} recently reported. In this alternative data compression method, information-rich portions of the data are dilated {{in a process that}} emulates the effect of group velocity dispersion on temporal signals.

50|$|In time {{stretched}} imaging, the object’s {{spatial information}} is encoded in {{the spectrum of}} laser pulses within a pulse duration of sub-nanoseconds. Each pulse representing one frame of the camera is then stretched in time {{so that it can}} be digitized in real-time by an electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ultra-fast pulse illumination freezes the motion of high-speed cells or particles in flow to achieve blur-free imaging. Detection sensitivity is challenged by the low number of photons collected during the ultra-short shutter time (optical pulse width) and the drop in the peak optical power resulting from the time stretch. These issues are solved in time stretch imaging by implementing a low noise-figure Raman amplifier within the dispersive device that performs time <b>stretching.</b> Moreover, <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> transform can be used in time stretch imaging to achieve optical image compression and nonuniform spatial resolution over the field-of-view.|$|R
40|$|High {{throughput}} real-time {{instruments are}} needed to acquire large data sets for detection and classification of rare events. Enabled by the photonic time stretch digitizer, {{a new class of}} instruments with record throughputs have led to the discovery of optical rogue waves [1], detection of rare cancer cells [2], and the highest analog-to-digital conversion performance ever achieved [3]. Featuring continuous operation at 100 million frames per second and shutter speed of less than a nanosecond, the time stretch camera is ideally suited for screening of blood and other biological samples. It has enabled detection of breast cancer cells in blood with record, one-in-a-million, sensitivity [2]. Owing to their high real-time throughput, instruments produce a torrent of data - equivalent to several 4 K movies per second - that overwhelm data acquisition, storage, and processing operations. This predicament calls for technologies that compress images in optical domain and in real-time. An example of this, based on <b>warped</b> <b>stretch</b> transformation and non-uniform Fourier domain sampling will be reported...|$|R

We extend this proposal to both positive and vanishing values of the cosmological constant where <b>stretched</b> <b>warped</b> anti-de Sitter space {{is found to be}} a solution. For positive cosmological constant, another class of warped solutions is obtained by a spacelike (timelike) line fibration over Lorentzian (Euclidean) two-dimensional de Sitter space. These solutions exhibit a cosmological horizon and Hawking temperature much like de Sitter space. Global identifications of this warped de Sitter space may contain a horizon in addition to the cosmological one. At a degenerate point, warped de Sitter space becomes a fibration over twodimensional flat space. Finally, we study scalar waves in these backgrounds.

50|$|Here the {{principle}} is described {{in the context of}} feature enhancement in digital images. The image is first filtered with a spatial kernel followed by application of a nonlinear frequency-dependent phase. The output of the transform is the phase in the spatial domain. The main step is the 2-D phase function which is typically applied in the frequency domain. The amount of phase applied to the image is frequency dependent with higher amount of phase applied to higher frequency features of the image. Since sharp transitions, such as edges and corners, contain higher frequencies, PST emphasizes the edge information. Features can be further enhanced by applying thresholding and morphological operations. PST is related to <b>warped</b> (anamorphic) <b>stretch</b> transform, another computational algorithm inspired by optical physics and one that performs nonuniform sampling and sparse coding.|$|R

40|$|Categorical {{perception}} (CP) is said {{to occur}} when a continuum of equally spaced physical changes is perceived as unequally spaced {{as a function of}} category membership (Harnad, S. (Ed.) (1987). Psychophysical and cognitive aspects of categorical perception: A critical overview. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). A common suggestion is that CP for color arises because perception is qualitatively distorted when we learn to categorize a dimension. Contrary to this view, we here report that English speakers show no evidence of lowered discrimination thresholds at the boundaries between blue and green categories even though CP is found at these boundaries in a supra-threshold task. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence of}} different discrimination thresholds between individuals from two language groups (English and Korean) who use different color terminology in the blue-green region and have different supra-threshold boundaries. Our participants' just noticeable difference (JND) thresholds suggest that they retain a smooth continuum of perceptual space that is not <b>warped</b> by <b>stretching</b> at category boundaries or by within-category compression. At least for the domain of color, categorical perception appears to be a categorical, but not a perceptual phenomenon. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Time series occur {{throughout}} {{nature and}} within almost every discipline of science. Producing accurate alignments of time series data was made feasible with the Dynamic Time <b>Warping</b> algorithm. Through <b>stretching</b> and compressing of individual {{points in time}} series data, this algorithm produces accurate and intuitive global time series alignments. In this paper, we extend the DTW algorithm to perform pseudo-local alignments with the Local Dynamic Time Warping (LDTW) algorithm. We apply the LDTW algorithm to simple time series data to demonstrate its ability to find local areas of high similarity. Finally, we present the use of LDTW as an initial step for extending a recent and more robust HMM times series alignment algorithm to also allow it to perform local alignments. I...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Based on fiber {{reinforced}} {{continuum mechanics}} theory, a simple hyperelastic constitutive model is developed {{to characterize the}} anisotropic nonlinear material behaviour of woven composite fabrics under large deformation during forming. The strain energy function for the hyperelastic model is additively decomposed into two parts nominally representing the tensile energy from weft and <b>warp</b> yarn fiber <b>stretches</b> and shearing energy from fiber-fiber interaction between weft and warp yarns, respectively. The proposed material characterization approach is demonstrated on a balanced plain weave composite fabric. The equivalent material parameters in the hyperelastic constitutive model are obtained by matching experimental load-displacement data of uni-axial tensile and picture frame tests on the woven composite fabric. The development of this anisotropic fiber reinforced hyperelastic model {{is critical to the}} numerical simulation and optimization of woven composites forming...|$|R

First, autocorrelation function {{is used to}} determine the pattern period of yarn-dyed fabric and according to this, the size of detection window can be obtained. Second, GLCMs are calculated with the specified parameters to characterise the original image. Third, Euclidean distances of GLCMs between being detected images and template image, which is selected from the defect-free fabric, are computed and then the threshold value is given to realise the defect detection. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this study can achieve accurate detection of common defects of yarn-dyed fabric, such as the wrong weft, weft crackiness, <b>stretched</b> <b>warp,</b> oil stain and holes...|$|R
50|$|A simple loom {{which has}} its roots in ancient civilizations {{consists}} of two sticks or bars between which the <b>warps</b> are <b>stretched.</b> One bar is attached to a fixed object, and the other to the weaver usually by means of a strap around the back. On traditional looms, the two main sheds are operated by means of a shed roll over which one set of warps pass, and continuous string heddles which encase each of the warps in the other set. The weaver leans back and uses his or her body weight to tension the loom. To open the shed controlled by the string heddles, the weaver relaxes tension on the warps and raises the heddles. The other shed is usually opened by simply drawing the shed roll toward the weaver. Both simple and complex textiles can be woven on this loom. Width is limited to how far the weaver can reach from side to side to pass the shuttle. Warp faced textiles, often decorated with intricate pick-up patterns woven in complementary and supplementary warp techniques are woven by indigenous peoples today around the world. They produce such things as belts, ponchos, bags, hatbands and carrying cloths. Supplementary weft patterning and brocading is practiced in many regions. Balanced weaves are also possible on the backstrap loom. Today, commercially produced backstrap loom kits often include a rigid heddle.|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{describe}} a beat-by-beat method {{for assessing the}} clinical utility of pulsatile waveforms, primarily recorded from cardiovascular blood volume or pressure changes, concentrating on the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Physiological blood flow is nonstationary, with pulses changing in height, width and morphology due to changes in heart rate, cardiac output, sensor type and hardware or software pre-processing requirements. Moreover, considerable inter-individual and sensor-location variability exists. Simple template matching methods are therefore inappropriate, and a patient-specific adaptive initialization is therefore required. We introduce dynamic time <b>warping</b> to <b>stretch</b> each beat to match a running template and combine it with several other features related to signal quality, including correlation {{and the percentage of}} the beat that appeared to be clipped. The features were then presented to a multi-layer perceptron neural network to learn the relationships between the parameters in the presence of good- and bad-quality pulses. An expert-labeled database of 1055 segments of PPG, each 6 s long, recorded from 104 separate critical care admissions during both normal and verified arrhythmic events, was used to train and test our algorithms. An accuracy of 97. 5 % on the training set and 95. 2 % on test set was found.

40|$|Guided wave {{analysis}} is a structural health monitoring technique for inspecting large structural areas. Many guided wave methods analyze {{the similarities between}} measurements through baseline subtraction. These baseline methods rely on the assumption of constant environmental conditions. Yet, in practical situations, environmental variations are unavoidable. For example, temperature variations perturb wave velocities and cause misalignments between baseline and measurement data. These variations significantly reduce the effectiveness of current structural health monitoring techniques. Temperature has a predictable approximate stretching-like effect on the guided wave data. Algorithms, such as optimal signal stretch (OSS) and the scale transform, {{have been used to}} optimally re-stretch and fit data to a baseline. While the methods are effective for small perturbations, their performance deteriorates for large temperature variations and long propagation distances. This deterioration occurs because the stretching approximation is not valid in these circumstances. As a result, {{there is a need for}} algorithms to better align guided wave data and adapt to larger changes. This paper utilizes dynamic time warping (DTW) to accurately align guided wave data. By utilizing dynamic programming, an optimal alignment is found which maximizes the correlation of the measurements with the baseline. In Figure 1, we show that dynamic time warping successfully aligns data while preserving the damage signatures with experimental data from an aluminum plate. The plate was heated in temperatures ranging from roughly 75 °F to 130 °F. Figure 1 illustrates the correlation coefficient between the first measurement and all following measurements after applying two methods: dynamic time <b>warping</b> and optimal <b>stretching.</b> Damage is simulated by attaching a magnet to the plate just before measurement 122. While optimal stretching improves correlation, the changes caused by the magnet are not distinguishable. The magnet is only identifiable in the dynamic time warping result, providing a steadier correlation coefficient of approximately 0. 9 prior to the damage with the expected decrease post-damage. This shows the increased performance of dynamic time <b>warping</b> over optimal <b>stretching...</b>|$|R

The boundary conditions are invariant under the semidirect product of the Virasoro algebra with a u(1) current algebra. We show that the canonical generators are integrable and finite.

30|$|When {{considering}} dance gestures, time-space dependencies are core aspects. This {{implies that}} the spatial deployment of body parts is directly linked to the temporal structure outlined in the music (involving rhythm and timing). The modeling and automatic recognition of dance gestures often involve Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) [7 – 10]. However, HMM has the property to exhibit some degree of invariance to local <b>warping</b> (compression and <b>stretching)</b> of the time-axis [11]. Even though this might be an advantage for applications like speech recognition, {{it is a serious}} drawback when considering spatiotemporal relationships in dance gestures. HMMs are fine for detecting basic steps and spatial patterns but cause major difficulties for timing aspects because of the inherent time-warping mechanism. Therefore, for the Dance-the-Music, we will introduce an approach based on spatiotemporal motion templates [12 – 14]. As will be explained in depth, the discrete time signals representing the gestural parameters extracted from dance movements are organized into a fixed-size multidimensional feature array forming the spatiotemporal template. Dance gesture recognition will be achieved by a template matching technique based on cross-correlation computation.|$|R

To start with we review the exact solutions of Einsteins field equations including the Penrose diagrams for highly symmetric space- times like that of Minkowski, de Sitter, anti-de Sitter and FLRW spacetimes. Next we review BTZ Black hole and their geometry for both rotating and non-rotating black holes. Balasubramanian and et. al. had found topologically non-trivial de Sitter (dS) solutions in (2 + 1) - dimensions, which are dubbed Kerr de Sitter and singular de Sitter quotients with Big bang/big crunch type singularities are also reviewed.

Here, we introduce time-stretch quantitative phase imaging (TS-QPI), a high-throughput label-free imaging flow cytometer developed for big data acquisition and analysis in phenotypic screening. TS-QPI is able to capture quantitative optical phase and intensity images simultaneously, enabling high-content cell analysis, cancer diagnostics, personalized genomics, and drug development. We further developed a complete machine learning pipeline that performs optical phase measurement, image processing, feature extraction, and classification. Multiple biophysical features such as morphological parameters, optical loss characteristics, and protein concentration are measured on individual cells. These biophysical measurements form a hyperdimensional feature space in which supervised learning is performed for cell classification. The technology is in clinical testing for blood screening and circulating tumor cell detection, as well as studying lipid accumulating algal strains for biofuel production. By integrating machine learning with high-throughput quantitative imaging, this system achieves record high accuracy in label-free cellular phenotypic screening and opens up a new path to data-driven diagnosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated, for the first time, real-time image compression performed in the optical domain to solve the big data challenge created by ultrafast measurement systems. Many ultrafast and high-throughput data acquisition equipment, including TS-QPI, produce a large volume of data in a short time, e. g. tens of Terabytes per hour. Such a data volume and velocity place a burden on data acquisition, storage, and processing and calls for technologies that compress images in optical domain and in real-time. As a solution, we have experimentally demonstrated <b>warped</b> time <b>stretch,</b> which offers variable spectral-domain sampling rate, {{as well as the}} ability to engineer the time-bandwidth product of the signal's envelope to match that of the data acquisition systems.
