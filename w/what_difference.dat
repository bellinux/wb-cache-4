25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, <b>what</b> <b>difference</b> does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E

It was unclear <b>what</b> <b>difference</b> [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program.

She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? <b>What</b> <b>difference</b> at this point does it make?

Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army."

2500|$|In {{a minute}} to the Cabinet's Defence and Overseas Policy {{committee}} the following month, Lamont set out his three objectives for the negotiations: first, to ensure Britain didn't have to join the single currency; second, to ensure the opt-out was legally water-tight; and third, to ensure that during the period {{in the run-up to}} the single currency, there should be no binding obligations on Britain. [...] In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: [...] "I can't see what you are so worked up about. We are in the ERM. <b>What</b> <b>difference</b> does it make if it is in the Treaty?" [...] Lamont decided to ignore their objections. At the next negotiating meeting on the treaty, he told his fellow European finance ministers that Britain would not accept membership of the ERM as a treaty obligation.

2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, [...] "With all due respect, {{the fact is we}} had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? <b>What</b> <b>difference,</b> at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, senator." [...] Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative Jeff Duncan accusing her of [...] "national security malpractice" [...] and Senator Rand Paul saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator John McCain said that while [...] "It's wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.|$|E
2500|$|Empress of Asia {{was one of}} five CPR {{ships that}} were taking men and {{materiel}} to reinforce Singapore {{in the face of}} the Japanese advance. The convoy, designated BM.12, had come under air attack in Banka Strait on 4 February 1942 suffering only minor damage. On 5 February, as the convoy entered the approaches to Singapore, serious attacks were pressed home south of Sultan Shoal Lighthouse. Nine Japanese dive bombers focused their attack on Empress of Asia. The second element of the convoy composed of Empress of Asia, [...] and City of Canterbury escorted by [...] and [...] came into sight of vessels in the harbor with Empress of Asia on fire amidships approaching Sultan Shoal.

Despite salvage efforts organized by Robert Rankin, all the military equipment and other supplies were lost.
