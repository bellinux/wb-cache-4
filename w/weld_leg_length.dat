Finite element analyses were carried out to further study the influence of the variation of the main weld parameters such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius and <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> on the stress concentration factors (SCF). Fatigue test results were presented by both a nominal stress based approach and a more refined structural stress based approach for the as-welded joints.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to perform physical tests on T-joint welded tubes to determine the axial static load behavior and compared them with the analytical and numerical calculations. Three experiments are performed and it is examined that typical collapse modes develop in the section of tube and associated Von-Mises stresses (distortion energy) are compared with the analytical method and numerical simulations. The comparisons with the experimental results are satisfactory. The validated numerical model is used to study the Von-Mises stresses with variation in the leg lengths of weld (2 mm, 3 mm leg lengths). The strength of fillet welded connections is investigated for different leg lengths. The ultimate strength of weld metal is determined by considering the forces acting on the welds. The effect of different leg lengths on the strength of welds is investigated by numerical methods and compared with analytical calculations which show that they are in agreement. The increasing in <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> is caused of increasing in weld strength and decreasing in stress progress in weld that cause the increasing in life and strength of the weld which is also in agreement with Iman Hadipour [4]...|$|E
50|$|There are 5 {{pieces to}} each Fillet weld {{known as the}} Root, Toe, Face, Leg and Throat. The root of the weld {{is the part of}} deepest {{penetration}} which is the opposite angle of the Hypotenuse. The toes of the weld are essentially the edges or the points of the hypotenuse. The face of the weld is the outer visual or hypotenuse that you see when looking at a fillet <b>weld.</b> The <b>legs</b> are the opposite and adjacent sides to the triangular fillet <b>weld.</b> The <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> is usually designated as the size of the weld. The throat of the weld is the distance {{from the center of the}} face to the root of the weld.

40|$|An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{model has}} been applied to the {{prediction}} of key weld geometries produced using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) with alternating shielding gases. This is a recently developed method of supplying shielding gases to the weld area in which the gases are discretely supplied at a given frequency. The model can be used to predict the penetration, <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and effective throat thickness for a given set of weld parameters and alternating shielding gas frequency. A comparison between the experimental and predicted geometries matched closely and demonstrates the effectiveness of this software approach in predicting weld outputs. The model has shown that the application of alternating shielding gases increases the penetration and effective throat thickness of a fillet <b>weld</b> whilst the <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> is reduced. A sensitivity analysis was performed which showed that the travel speed is the most influential input parameter when predicting weld geometries, this is to be expected for any given welding set-up due to the influence of the travel speed on the heat input. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the shielding gas configuration had the lowest influence on the output of the model. The output from the model has demonstrated that the use of alternating shielding gases during GMAW results in a step change in the weld metal geometry. This suggests that, in the case of alternating shielding gases, an increased travel speed is required to produce a similar weld geometry to that of the conventional Ar/ 20 %CO 2 technique...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the trends}} in ship {{building}} is {{the building of}} larger and faster ships. However, increasing demand for speed has forced the ship designers to search for alternative materials to reduce {{the weight of the}} ship without compromising strength. Aluminium alloys, once properly designed, can achieve this goal by reducing the weight of structural components by over 50 % compared to those made of normal carbon steel. Another advantage of aluminium alloys is that its corrosion resistance. In a sea environment, steel has been found to corrode about 100 times faster than aluminium alloys under the same corrosive environment. As the size of aluminium ship increases, fatigue {{has become one of the}} main design criteria. In order to effectively make use of the high strength/weight ratio of aluminium alloys, the cross section of the structural components as well as the joint design should be optimized to provide sufficient fatigue strength while still maintain acceptable fabrication cost. Extruded hollow stiffeners have been proven to be able to provide excellent light and stiff panels for aluminium ships. Box stiffener is such a cross section profile investigated in the present study. The box stiffener is usually oriented longitudinally by interacting with a large number of web frames by fillet welds. These welded joints may be exposed to larger fatigue damage due to its significant stress variations experienced during the service of the ships. In addition, welding of these joints is quite costly since there are a lage amount of them and it is difficult to apply automatic welding due to complex profile. Any simplification in the welding procedure would cause a significant benefit to the ship builders. Three similar web frame/box stiffener connections are considered in these studies, by varying the opening shape on the web fame and accordingly the welding procedure. The objective is to achieve sufficient fatigue strength while still maintaining an economically efficient joint. The first connection (denoted as Alt- 1) tries to make a relatively larger opening on the web frame for easy assembling and more space for welding. The second and third alternatives (denoted as Alt- 2 and Alt- 3) are identical in the opening on the web frame while differs on welding procedure only. Interrupted welding is performed for Alt- 2 to save both the human resource and weld material while continuous welding is required for Alt- 3 for a simple welding procedure. Alt- 3 also provides a water tight solution due to the continuous welding. It is found that the change of cutting shapes on the web frame as well as the corresponding weld procedure has great impact on both the static and fatigue properties of the joints. Extra welding around the web frame may cause a high stress concentration at the weld toe and therefore imply an unacceptable fatigue damage. However, a simple weld can be a good candidate to achieve sufficient fatigue strength. Butt weld is usually used to join two pre-fabricated units to obtain sufficient overall strength of the joined single piece structure. However, difficulty may arise for such units when the box stiffeners are presented as the longitudinal stiffeners due to relatively large shrinkage and distortion introduced in the fabrication process including welding in the adjacent area. A special type of lap joint, denoted as box stiffener lap joint is designed to provide a joining solution for the box stiffeners. By enabling the inside profile of the lapping plate to be identical to the outside profile of the box stiffener, the joining of two box stiffeners is just to weld the intersection lines between the lapping plate and box stiffener. Only the wide flanges of the box stiffener require a conventional weld. Cracking from the weld root should be avoided to ensure sufficient fatigue strength. Good fatigue performance is observed for the box stiffener lap joint. The <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> is found to be a determining factor that affects both the fatigue strength and fatigue crack initiation site. <b>Weld</b> <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> between 6. 0 and 7. 5 mm is suggested to avoid high stress concentration at the weld toe. Moreover, this design reduces the likelihood of fatigue cracks to initiate from the most complex manual welding area. Information about fatigue analysis of welded aluminium structures is quite limited in the open literature. This thesis deals with fatigue assessment methods of welded aluminium plate structures based on both numerical analysis and experimental tests. Various stress based fatigue assessment methods such as the nominal, structural and notch stress approaches have been applied to the investigated joints. The nominal stress range approach can not provide a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength of novel welded joints because the local geometrical details including structural geometry and weld geometry are implicitly embedded in the nominal design SN curves. Laboratory tests would hence be needed to establish nominal stress approaches. More refined local approaches including the structural stress range approach and the notch stress range approach have been developed for a more accurate assessment of the fatigue strength. The main challenge for these local approaches is to find suitable stress calculation methods in the vicinity of the weld and thereby the uncertainties that determine the fatigue strength of the joint can be quantitatively reflected in a local stress concentration factor. Several of these methods are applied in the study of novel types of welded aluminium joints in this thesis. The choice of design SN curves must be consistent with the way by which the design stress range is calculated. Fatigue test data support the use of a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 40 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium fillet welded in-plane bracket connections when the structural stress has been derived from the extrapolation methods. It has been shown that a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 44 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium lap joints can be used. Another important issue is to investigate the effect of the local weld geometry such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius, and <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> on the value of the structural/notch stress and accordingly on fatigue behaviour. The weld parameters of the joints have been measured in the laboratory and the statistical measured values are used in the numerical finite element models (FEM). Improving fatigue strength of critical joints is found to be necessary late in the design process or during the service time of a structure to extend the whole service life of the structure. The effect of weld toe grinding on the stress concentration at the weld toe is studied by finite element analysis (FEA). Fatigue tests show that the fatigue life in terms of number of cycles to failure is nearly doubled by simply grinding the weld toe of the joint. However, the standard deviations are not so much affected as the fatigue strength. The effect of weld parameters such as the grinding depth has been found to play a decisive role in fatigue life improvement. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, an {{investigation}} of the fatigue life benefits emerging from fillet weld geometries optimization has been carried out. At first, an introduction to ageing mechanisms, corrosion and especially fatigue, acting on operating marine structures has been made. Residual stresses at weld toes, stress modes, and types, geometrical factors (weld angle, toe radius, leg length), welding techniques selected, post-welding treatment and plate‟s material are some of the principal factors affecting the fatigue life of a fillet weld joint. Especially, the accuracy of various approaches in fatigue life estimation of specific geometries under pre-set types and levels of stress is studied. It is evident so far that even the notch stress concept is the most accurate method based on S-N curves, the Fracture Mechanics approach can offer more accurate solutions of a crack development through the material. Towards this, a literature review on crack evolution aspects in welded and non-welded plates under bending and tension was performed; substantial parameters were determined and finally implemented in the LEFM model which was used for the simulation purposes of Chapter 6. As far as the crack aspect ratio evolution is concerned, an extensive reference is available in literature since many researchers have investigated its contribution to the determination of geometrical paths, commonly known as “Preferred Propagation Paths”. Their significance is related with our ability to determine accurate SIF solutions leading to precise fatigue life estimations. A typical fillet weld joint 2 -D model has been developed in CAE Abaqus software and a Finite Element Analysis of subject T-profile has been carried out. Through this analysis, the fillet weld angle, the <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> the weld toe curvature radio ρ and the carrying load plate thickness are examined for their impacts on the maximum surface stress. Finally, a number of stress mitigating measures are proposed and their effects are analyzed. Undoubtedly, the notch stress concept today is gradually gaining more and more acceptance among other fatigue analysis practices, hence the need for an estimation of the actual surface stresses along fillet weld toes, has become imperative. Towards this, different 2 -D geometries are tested against stress concentration factors developed at weld toes, which are calculated on the basis of maximum in-plane principal stresses over nominal stresses in mode I pure bending and pure tension respectively. Moreover, validation with corresponding results from literature is provided. Finally, three different concepts for reducing the maximum surface stresses are presented. The first one proposes grinding of the weld toe area and formulation of an artificial U-notch or a part- circular profile. The second one applies to non-penetrating welds and assumes the existence of a root gap of a specific geometry which is related to the fatigue life and stress concentration factor of the fillet weld joint. Last but not least, the relatively recent concept of the variable radius notch is discussed, even though it is applicable mostly to notched bodies, not weld joints. Afterwards, a Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics analysis of reference 2 D fillet weld model is demonstrated. A number of geometrical parameters considered at previous stage for their impact on surface Stress Concentration levels at the weld toe region, have been correlated to fatigue life benefits in terms of increased number of stress cycles till failure. An extensive analysis of 9 different T-butt weld joint geometries has been provided in order to investigate how positively a possible SCF reduction can affect the fatigue life of a weld joint. Essential geometric variations (weld angle, length, toe radius, root slot) were considered in the 2 D model. All calculated benefits both in pure bending and pure tension cases have been reported accordingly. Based on a linear interpolation of the points scatter (SCF, N-cycles) both in banding and tension, it was observed that a surface stress mitigation of 1 % could lead to 1, 33 up to 2, 5 % fatigue life benefit in the range of SCF= 2 – 2, 5. It is evident so far that the geometrical optimization of a weld joint in respect of notch stress mitigation can be a powerful tool both in shipbuilding and maintenance practice in the future. However, technically wise their application may incur high initial costs of improved tools of welding and post welding treatment and robots even though it would consist a cost effective solution in a medium/long term basis. Finally, the above process is followed by a reliability analysis of the most critical geometrical parameters affecting the fatigue life of a fillet weld joint. Reliability assessment results concerning medium, high and low cycle fatigue are provided and a comparative analysis of each factor‟s impact on fatigue life has been carried out...|$|E

With a minimum 1 year follow-up, we evaluated whether the <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and offset goals were achieved, how well the navigation and radiology data were correlated and whether navigation-specific and non-specific complications occurred. Based on our hypothesis that 80 % of patients would have less than 5 mm <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> difference and the null hypothesis (PA=P 0) with an alpha of 0. 05, 200 observations were required to achieve a power of 90 %. ResultsThe <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and offset objectives were achieved in 83. 3 % and 88 % of cases, respectively. Twenty-two patients required a heel wedge to compensate for <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> differences. The correlation between the radiology and surgical navigation data was satisfactory – the Pearson coefficient was 0. 79 for length and 0. 74 for offset. Intraoperative and postoperative complications or adverse events were found in 14. 6 % of cases; these were specific to CAOS in 12. 1 % of cases and non-specific in 2. 5 % of cases. ConclusionThis study shows the relevance of CAOS for achieving preoperative <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> objectives, with good correlation between navigation and radiology data, and without major complications.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> and {{relative}} <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> {{are considered to}} be reliable markers of prepubertal living conditions. Cessation of leg growth, driven by estrogen, occurs earlier in puberty in girls than boys. We hypothesized that <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> {{and relative}} <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> as sitting height to leg ratio, might have sex-specific associations with age of puberty. Methods: We used multivariable linear regression in 10, 046 older (≥ 50 years) Chinese from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (Phase 3) to examine the associations of recalled age of puberty (women: age of menarche, and men: mean age of first nocturnal emission, voice breaking, and first pubic hair) with subischeal <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> sitting height to leg ratio, and sitting height. Results: <b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> and sitting height to leg ratio had different associations with age of puberty in men and women (P-values for interaction < 0. 001), but sitting height did not. Per year earlier puberty, legs were longer among men by 0. 09 cm (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01 - 0. 18) and shorter among women by 20. 16 cm (95 % CI 20. 20 to 20. 12). Further adjustment for age, hip size (as a marker of buttock fat), and several markers of childhood conditions did not obviate the difference in association by sex. Conclusions: Adult <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and relative <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (sitting height to leg ratio) may be biomarkers of different exposures in men and women, with corresponding implications for their interpretation as a biomarker of early life exposures. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

For the two tailed test, the alternative hypothesis is that hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> may be either greater than or less than foreleg length.

40|$|Abstract Evidence for the {{simplification}} {{of motor}} {{control of the}} limbs through {{a reduction in the}} number of degrees of freedom exists in areas of research such as neuroscience, robotics, and biomechanics. Human hopping in place can be modeled well with spring-mass dynamics and provides a tractable model by which to study how the locomotor system compensates through inter-joint coordination to achieve stability of performance variables, <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation. This study provides the first evidence for how the redundancy of human leg joints may be simply coor-dinated to stabilize spring-mass dynamics throughout the hopping cycle using an uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis. We use a UCM analysis to quantify the structure of joint variance that stabilizes the hypothesized perfor-mance variables, <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and <b>leg</b> orientation. For one-legged human hopping in place, we hypothesized that <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation would each be stabilized throughout the entire hopping cycle. We also hypothesized that hop-ping at non-preferred frequencies would be more difficult for subjects and stabilization of <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation would increase. Kinematic data from eleven subjects hopping at three frequencies (2. 2, 2. 8, and 3. 2 Hz) were collected and analyzed within the framework of the UCM. Maximum <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> stabilization was observed at mid-stance when <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> was most susceptible to small changes in joint angles. Overall stabilization of <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> increased as subjects hopped at higher frequencies, reflecting the increased demands on the control system. The stabilization of leg orientation during aerial phase acted to position the foot at initial contact to determine velocity and trajectory of the center of mass during the stance phase. Because hopping in place does not require a change in forward velocity, the control strategy for leg orientation remained the same across frequencies. We conclude that stabilization of <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation may signify a reduction in degrees of freedom in the control system...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Background: We analyse the NHANES III sample {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} of measured stature and sitting height to estimate <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (tibia + femur) and predict fatness. High rates of overweight in the United States population may lead to greater gluteo-femoral fat mass which will increase sitting height and artificially decrease estimates of both absolute and relative <b>leg</b> <b>length.</b> Methods: The analyses include 3076 women and 3233 men, 20. 0 - 49. 9 years of age of White, Black or Mexican-American ethnicity. The poverty index ratio, measured stature, sitting height, upper <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> weight, four skinfolds, buttocks circumference and elbow, biacromial and biiliac breadths were extracted from the database. The sitting height ratio, % body fatness, % upper <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (ULL/stature), and other indices were estimated. Correlation and principle component analysis {{were used to assess}} the relationship between measures of body fatness, relative <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and the other variables. Results: For adults in the NHANES III %body fat is more strongly correlated with buttocks circumference (r = 0. 87 and 0. 78 for women and men), than with any measure of estimated <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (r's range from - 0. 28 to - 0. 10 for both sexes). Principle components analysis separates fatness, stature and estimated <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> into uncorrelated factors for this sample. Conclusion: Reports of a negative association between <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and fatness for adults of the NHANES III are likely spurious, due to greater gluteo-femoral fat thickness increasing sitting height. Future rounds of the NHANES, and similar surveys in other nations with high body fat populations, should measure lower extremity length directly to better assess its relationship to health and disease risk. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Some of the {{important}} mosquito species are generally sympatric {{in terms of their}} geographical distributions, and are diffi cult to identify based solely on examination of adult females using the available morphological keys. In this study, adult mosquitoes were collected indoors in Abeokuta in south-western Nigeria between August 2005 and July 2006 using Center for Disease Control light traps. The objective was to investigate possible morphological differences in populations of Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia africana. Six morphological characters namely, wing length, antennal length, proboscis length, foreleg <b>length,</b> mid <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> were measured in the two species. A total of 868 Cx quinquefasciatus and 962 M. africana were collected during the study period. The mean length was observed to be higher in most characters during the wet season than the dry season but the variation was not statistically signifi cant (P> 0. 005). In M. africana, the antennal length, proboscis length, foreleg length and midleg length showed one peak each. The wing length exhibited three peaks while hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> showed two peaks. For Cx quinquefasciatus, the antennal length, proboscis length, foreleg <b>length,</b> mid <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> indicated one peak. The wing length however showed three peaks. Each of the peaks observed in wing <b>length</b> and hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> of M. africana and wing length of Cx quinquefasciatus was assumed to be a specifi c population. The coeffi cient of differences (CDs) for each population indicated the presence of three populations in M. africana (CD> 1. 28).

40|$|For 30 years, using {{equations}} {{determined by}} Alexander (1976), paleontologists have estimated speeds of dinosaurs from their trackways; the fundamental assumption, based on limited observations, was that dinosaur hip height is approximately four times foot length. Thulborn (1990) subsequently {{determined that the}} <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> to foot length ratio ranges from 4. 5 - 6. 0, according to type and size of dinosaur. Given that the focus of many published footprint studies is to estimate dinosaur speed from Alexander’s equations, {{it is critical that}} the hip height of the track maker can be ascertained from the footprint measurement. If there is high variability in the ratio of hip height:foot length within a group of dinosaurs, speed estimates are going to be extremely unreliable. This study examined the relationship between foot <b>length</b> and <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> in a variety of dinosaurs. Measurements of 24 dinosaur specimens included ornithischians (bipedal and quadrupedal), theropods, dinosauriforms, birds, and sauropods. <b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> was defined as femur + tibia + metatarsal III; foot length was defined as that part of the foot preserved in footprints (digit III phalanges ± claw + metatarsal III – metatarsal IV). <b>Leg</b> and foot <b>lengths</b> were compared and it was found that in bipedal ornithischians the foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio is ~ 5. 4 - 5. 9, and in theropods, 2. 8 - 4. 2. Contrary to previous studies, we found that (1) there is no correlation between dinosaur size and foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio, (2) the foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio is greater than previously estimated, and (3) the foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio is highly variable for each group of dinosaurs. We conclude that estimating dinosaur speed from trackways should not be undertaken lightly, and the results be interpreted with caution...|$|R
