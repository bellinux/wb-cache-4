[...] Bernthal applauded the writers for such changes, and felt that the storyline never devitalized. [...] "The people that Shane loved more {{than anyone else in the}} world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to and the way he once was. Every relationship—Shane/Carl, Shane/Lori and Shane/Rick—it's tainted and fractured. When you suffer from that kind of loneliness, it brings out the worst in you." ...|$|E

500|$|Before the {{recording}} of Office of Strategic Influence, the last time Moore and Portnoy worked together was on Dream Theater's Awake in 1994. Matheos was initially concerned about how Moore and Portnoy would feel about working {{together for the first}} time in eight years. Moore noted that he and Portnoy were not on bad terms, but [...] "just weren't in touch." [...] The two both described the experience as initially [...] "awkward". When recording the album Portnoy had to take directions from others; he found this difficult as he was used to taking the creative lead. Moore noted that there was tension when recording the same drum part for a song more than once (in order to give Moore choice later on): [...] "He's used to just playing the stroke once, the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Mutual were {{patient with}} Chaplin's {{decreased}} rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned {{concern about the}} declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, [...] "Charlie [...] be allowed {{all the time he}} needs and all the money for producing [...] the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants...</b> It is quality, not quantity, we are after." [...] In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1million. He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order. It was completed in January 1918, and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.|$|E

Tim Byron, writer for The Vine, [...] "'Grenade' is about the feeling of [...] ". The critic added, [...] "Mars knows she is bad for him, that's she's preventing him from thinking straight, that he can't actually have her the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her." [...] As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: [...] "'Grenade' represents the OTHER side of love– where you're in love with a woman and you {{know for a fact that}} she doesn't love you the way you love HER." ...|$|E

500|$|Selman commented in {{an audio}} {{commentary}} for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] that [...] "the {{thing that really}} got the [...] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart." [...] Greaney identified this version as [...] "the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else {{that they used to}} be cool, that it's everyone else's fault that his life hasn't gone the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> it to go." [...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is {{the kind of person who}} is [...] "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later." [...] Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.|$|E

500|$|Of Human Feelings was a {{continuation}} of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist: [...] "When we read Ornette's music we have his notes, but we listen for his phrases and phrase the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to. I can take the same melody, then, and phrase it like I want to, and those notes will determine the phrasing, the rhythm, the harmony– all of that." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{starting}} serialization the manga was unpopular and {{was close}} to being cancelled. Although Sorachi {{was pleased with the}} first tankōbon selling all of its copies, he later learned Shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in the minimum printed. In order to increase its popularity, the author introduce new characters, the Shinsengumi, who felt memorable to his assistants. [...] Sorachi had little hope on the manga's popularity, as he noted that people used to tell him the manga would not surpass the number of two tankōbon volumes. However, once the third volume was released, Sorachi found {{that he did not have}} [...] "any fresh material to use." [...] During the first year of the series, Sorachi believed that the source of the popularity of Gin Tama was partially connected to the Shinsengumi drama. While the drama ran during the first year of the series, when the manga was mostly shorter stories that established the characters and the world, he felt uncomfortable of making things related to the drama. By the second year and beyond, he became more daring in his stories and concepts, creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping his sense of humor and satirization of modern Japan by way of his fictionalized past. Although Sorachi has already planned the series' ending, he is not sure when the manga is going to reach that point due to the characters requiring development to behave the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Despite Carlson's culinary skill, Schwa has {{struggled}} to remain afloat.

2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} arises from Carlson's lack of focus on money and {{material}} possessions.
