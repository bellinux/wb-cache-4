In the valley below, he saw a frozen lake and a dark, <b>winding</b> <b>band</b> he knew was timber on a river bank. He had food, and if he could reach the trees he need not bother about the frost. A Canadian grub-hoe, made for cutting roots, is a useful tool, and he could build a wall of bark and branches, light a fire and brew hot tea.

40|$|In 1988 Bernardo Adam Ferrero's <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> {{composition}} Homenaje a Joaquín Sorolla was premiered at the International <b>Wind</b> <b>Band</b> Contest in Valencia, Spain. This {{relatively unknown}} <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> composition combines {{the elements of}} visual art and music to create a contemporary work for <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> using oil-canvas paintings of Valencian artist Joaquín Sorolla {{as the source of}} inspiration. In this document, the author discusses pertinent biographical information about the composer and the artist, and examines the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> composition and the paintings through musical and visual analysis to evaluate Ferrero's musical interpretation of programmatic themes of the paintings. Through analysis of the craftsmanship of this composition and its connection to the visual arts, the author advocates for Homenaje a Joaquín Sorolla’s inclusion in the core <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> repertoire...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>bands</b> {{have been}} {{recording}} for {{over one hundred}} years. Through advancements in both technology and process, recordings have made a monumental impact on the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> and its repertoire. These advancements have created clarity regarding the performance practice of pieces and helped to preserve the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> repertoire. Many early works have gained masterwork status due, in large part, {{to the fact that}} recordings have preserved them. The increase in popularity of recording and, in particular, the <b>wind</b> <b>band,</b> warrants an investigation into the various aspects of the process. Additionally, gaining insight from <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> professionals who record will help to evaluate the contributions that recording has made to the education of performers and listeners, the preservation of repertoire and the artistic enhancement of the <b>wind</b> <b>band.</b> Each chapter explores aspects of the recording process and how those aspects have shaped the <b>wind</b> <b>band,</b> its repertoire and performance practice. Information from conductors, composers and engineers provide valuable insight pertaining to the educational, historical and artistic components of the recording process. The goal of all involved in the recording process should be the pursuit of technical perfection, which does not eclipse the ultimate musical goals of the project and the integrity of the composer's intentions...|$|R
40|$|Trumpet method {{books have}} existed {{almost as long}} as the trumpet itself. From Cesare Bendenelli {{collecting}} pedagogical information in the late 16 th century, to the most recent publications, thousands of books have been written for the trumpet. Publishers including Carl Fisher, Belwin, Alfred, Charles Colin Music, M. Baron Company, and Alphonse Leduc offer over 400 trumpet method books containing studies on intonation, high-register, rhythm, orchestral excerpts, transpositions, solos, etc. With such a wealth of material, there is not one book containing trumpet excerpts from the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> literature. This project seeks to fill this void by offering a compilation of 586 of the most popular and difficult trumpet excerpts from the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> literature. In addition to the musical excerpts, each excerpt contains insights from some of the premier players in the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> field. The aforementioned insights were applied to each excerpt to give the reader an easy-to-understand approach to learning <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> repertoire. As a result, this dissertation will serve multiple functions in the trumpet community, including promoting the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> genre; teaching students important, yet neglected, works; developing healthy practice habits; presenting a more pragmatic application of higher musical study; and, of course, the identifying and organizing of difficult <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> literature for the trumpet.

50|$|Until {{early in}} the 20th century, there was little music written {{specifically}} for the <b>wind</b> <b>band,</b> which led to an extensive repertoire of pieces transcribed from orchestral works, or arranged from other sources. However, as the <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> {{moved out of the}} sole domain of the military marching ensemble and into the concert hall, it has gained favor with composers, and now many works are being written specifically for the concert <b>band</b> and the <b>wind</b> ensemble. While today there are composers who write exclusively for band, {{it is worth noting that}} many composers famous for their work in other genres have given their talents to composition for <b>wind</b> <b>bands</b> as well. This is especially true in Japan, where an enormous market can be found for <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> compositions, which is largely due to commissions by the All-Japan Band Association and leading professional ensembles such as the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra and Osaka Municipal Symphonic Band, as well as the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma Commissioning Program, the longest-running commissioning series for <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> in the United States.|$|R

40|$|This study {{broadens}} {{awareness of}} two accomplished American composers’ contributions to various media in general, and <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> in particular by examining specific <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> works that illustrate their compositional style for the medium. The opening chapters include biographical information of each composer, including musical training, professional background, appointments held, awards, compositional style, and education. Carolyn Bremer has written thirteen works for <b>wind</b> <b>band.</b> An orchestral bassist by training, Bremer focused her musical talents on composition {{at the age}} of twenty-four. Among Bremer’s works for <b>wind</b> <b>band,</b> Early Light maintains a consistent performance record. An accomplished pianist, organist, and composer, Nancy Galbraith’s compositional career spans three decades. Although she has contributed significantly to chamber and small ensembles, her catalog contains approximately 120 works for various media. Febris ver is one of Galbraith’s recent contributions to the <b>wind</b> <b>band.</b> Commissioned for the 2012 College Band Directors National Association, the work received its premier performance in February of that year. This project fills a major gap in the literature regarding the work of Bremer and Galbraith; to date, it is the first study of its kind and brings to light information not previously published...|$|R
40|$|The Dissertation {{is focused}} on {{features}} of the symphonic <b>wind</b> <b>band,</b> especially its sound, dynamics and aesthetics. The first part shortly describes history of the Czech <b>wind</b> <b>bands</b> and compares contemporary posture of symphonic wind background in the CZ and abroad as well. Discovery of <b>wind</b> <b>band?s</b> features was supported also by the Czech composers, who found this medium appropriate to express their musical language. The second chapter brings formal, compositional and interpretative analysis of representative samples of six the Czech symphonic <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> pieces of music that was composed during the 2 nd part of the 20 th century. Centroid of that music came from the Czech composers staying in the USA such as K. B. Jirák, Václav Nelhybel and Karel Husa. The Aria - the second movement of Music for Prague 1968 is analysed globally. Particular specification of orchestration and interpretation are focused from conductor?s {{point of view and}} there is close relationship with methodology of work with symphonic <b>wind</b> <b>band</b> and specific theory of interpretation. The Dissertation has not been terminated, it aims to the future with emphasis to provoke activity toward phenomenon of the Symphonic band music in all levels, compositional and interpretative...|$|R
