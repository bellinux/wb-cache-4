6000|$|The {{family at}} Castle Meal saw nothing of any Indian {{until the day}} that succeeded the council. Gershom and Dorothy {{received}} the tidings of their sister's marriage with very little emotion. It was an event they expected; and as for bride-cake and ceremonies, of one there was none at all, and of the other no more than has been mentioned. The relatives of Margery did not break their hearts {{on account of the}} neglect with which they had been treated, but received the young couple as if one had given her away, and the other [...] "had pulled off her glove," [...] as young ladies now express it, in deference to the act that generally gives the coup de grace to youthful female friendships. On the Openings, neither time nor breath is wasted in useless compliments; and all was held to be <b>well</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> this occasion, because it was done legally. A question might have been raised, indeed, whether that marriage had taken place under the American, or under the English flag; for General Hull, in surrendering Detroit, had included the entire territory of Michigan, as well as troops present, troops absent, and troops on the march to join him. Had he been in possession of Peter's ruthless secret, which we happen to know he was not, he {{could not have been more}} anxious to throw the mantle of British authority around all of his race on that remote frontier, than he proved himself to be. Still, it is to be presumed that the marriage would have been regarded as legal; conquered territories usually preserving their laws and usages for a time, at least. A little joking passed, as a matter of course; for this is de rigueur in all marriages, except in the cases of the most cultivated; and certainly neither the corporal nor Gershom belonged to the elite of human society.|$|E

Alas! the inner voice is sad and dull, Even at the crown and shout of victory. Oh! I had hugged this purpose to my heart, Cast by {{for it all}} ruth, all pride, all scruples; Yet now its face, that seemed as pure as crystal, Shows fleshly, foul, and stained with tears and gore! We make, and moil, like {{children}} in their gardens, And spoil with dabbled hands, our flowers i' the planting. And yet a saint is made! Alas, those children! Was there no gentler way? I know not any: I plucked the gay moth from the spider's web; What if my hasty hand have smirched its feathers? Sure, if the whole be good, each several part May for its private blots forgiveness gain, As in man's tabernacle, vile elements Unite to one fair stature. Who'll gainsay it? The whole is good; another saint in heaven; Another bride within the Bridegroom's arms; And she will pray for me!--And yet what matter? Better that I, this paltry sinful unit, Fall fighting, crushed into the nether pit, If my dead corpse may bridge the path to Heaven, And damn itself, to save the souls of others. A noble ruin: yet small comfort in it; In it, or in aught else---- A blank dim cloud before mine inward sense Dulls all the past: she spoke of such a cloud-- I struck her for't, {{and said it was}} a fiend-- She's happy now, before the throne of God-- I should be merry; yet my heart's floor sinks As on a fast day; sure some evil bodes. Would it were here, that I might see its eyes! The future only is unbearable! We quail before the rising thunderstorm Which thrills and whispers in the stifled air, Yet blench not, when it falls. Would it were here! ...|$|E

Pseudo-random number generators are the most widely used generators for the Monte Carlo methods.

Spare parts from different manufacturer other than the one that has produced the equipment might not have work so well in every unit. ATP systems, including reagents, are designed to work like a unit, especially since it was related to the reproducibility of the results in the presence of plant chemicals such as those for sanitary. Therefore, considering the value of ATP test equipment, consistency and availability of materials are essential for smooth operation and use of equipment. Finally, ATP testing equipment requires a quality operator. The operator uses the equipment and support to the manufacturer or retailer. Without proper training, education and technical support, investment in ATP system can be unproductive, especially when used on the ship.|$|E
40|$|The present diploma thesis {{consists}} of two parts, theoretical and empirical. The theoretical part deals with praise and reprimand and with how they should be expressed. Above all, the present thesis is focused on analysis of kindergarten cases. The analysis of cases involving praise or reprimand includes eight groups of pre-school children and shows how teachers of pre-school children express praise and reprimand, how children respond {{to both of them}} and whether a way of expressing them depends on the level of education and years of work experience. It has been established that the age group of children, the level of education of kindergarten teachers included in the study and the sex of the child that was praised or reprimanded, have an impact on expression of praise and reprimand. Years of work experience of kindergarten teachers included in the study only have an impact on praise, and they usually use short phrases of praise (for example: Good boy! Great! Nice! <b>Well</b> <b>done!).</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, they use long reprimands more often. This means they also explain to children why they are being reprimanded. From the viewpoint of children’s response it has been established that children respond to reprimand more frequently than to praise. ...|$|E

The development was made by adapting the development model by Borg and Gall consisting of seven development stages: (1) preliminary investigation, (2) planning, (3) preliminary product arrangement,(4) product validation (5) small group tryout, (6) field tryout, and (7) dissemination. The tryout {{subjects in this study}} were 40 students. The details of those students were 11 students for small group tryout, 28 students as the experimental group and the other 29 students as the control group. The experimental group was taught using problem based learning kits, while the control group using learning kits that already exist. The data were collected through product validation sheets, classroom observation sheets, students questionnaires, science process skills test and science process skills observation sheets. The results show that the developed problem based learning kits  are valid and effective to improve students science process skills. The study validation showed the kits are excellent, with an average score of 4. 52. The tryout results shows that the kits at the level of practicality on small groups and field are very good showing that 87. 90 % learning process is <b>well</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> small groups, while on the field tryout is 97. 22 %.
