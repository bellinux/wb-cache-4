50|$|Initially {{the concept}} of the X2010 was based on a low air resistance, single seater covered wheel prototype, a <b>wing</b> <b>car</b> powered by a forced {{induction}} engine producing 1479 HP, aiming to achieve a top speed of over 470 km/h (292 mph) (max of 494 km/h whilst using slipstreams in the game) and a maximum lateral G-force of 6g. Upon seeing the machines concept and design model, Newey proposed the addition of fan car technology, a long-time dream held as a racing designer.|$|E

50|$|Ferrari {{followed}} Renault in the turbo revolution {{by introducing}} a turbocharged derivative of the Dino design (a 1.5 L 120° V6) with the Ferrari 126. However, the 120° design {{was not considered}} optimal for the <b>wing</b> <b>cars</b> of the era and later engines used V angles of 90° or less.|$|R
2500|$|In the end, the Daytona {{was brought}} down by the {{decision}} to make the 1970 Plymouth Superbird the only Chrysler winged car for the model year. While Daytonas were raced through the 1970 season, only one Daytona was raced until 1971 (in the 1971 Daytona 500) when NASCAR decreed that engine displacement of <b>wing</b> <b>cars</b> {{would be limited to}} [...] That particular car, driven by Dick Brooks, finished in seventh place.|$|R
50|$|For the 1971 Formula One season March Engineering came up {{with the}} {{remarkable}} 711 chassis, which had aerodynamics by Frank Costin and an ovoid front wing described as the Spitfire (for its shape) or 'Tea-tray' (for its elevation from the <b>car)</b> <b>wing.</b> The <b>car</b> took no wins, but Ronnie Peterson finished second on four occasions, ending as runner-up in the World Championship. Alfa Romeo V8 powered cars were occasionally entered, to little avail (following on from an equally unsuccessful Alfa program with McLaren).|$|R
5000|$|Brambilla drove briefly for the Alfa Romeo Formula One team in 1979 and 1980. On {{the first}} day of {{qualifying}} for the 1979 United States Grand Prix Brambilla was timed at 83.87 miles per hour (134.98 km/h). Heavy rain caused a slick track and slower times. In December 1979 Alfa Romeo revealed its Formula One race car for the 1980 season. The company named Patrick Depailler, Brambilla, and Bruno Giacomelli as its drivers. The racer was nearly identical to one driven by Giacomelli in the 1979 Italian Grand Prix. It was a <b>wing</b> <b>car</b> design with a V-12 engine that generated more than [...] Alfa Romeo announced that it was working on a 1,500 cubic centimeter turbocharged engine which was to begin track testing in a Formula One car in the summer of 1980.|$|E
50|$|After a {{third place}} in the United States Grand Prix West, Piquet {{qualified}} on pole position in his home race, the Brazilian Grand Prix in his birth city of Rio de Janeiro, but quickly faded from contention after starting the race on slick tires on a wet track. At the next race, the Argentine Grand Prix in Buenos Aires, Brabham got around the ground-clearance rule by devising a suspension system that kept the car at the required height during technical inspection but lowered it onto the ground at speed, allowing it to race once again as a <b>wing</b> <b>car.</b> The superiority of the car was such that Piquet swept to victory and even his teammate Héctor Rebaque, who usually sailed in the rear, managed to retain second place until {{he was forced to}} retire. At the San Marino Grand Prix, almost all the teams adopted the innovation brought to Argentina by Brabham. Piquet won the race despite being caught out by rain.|$|E
60|$|As {{the train}} pulled out, Ethel Wing waved {{to her from}} the midst of a group of girls on the wide rear {{platform}} of the last car. It was Mr. <b>Wing's</b> private <b>car,</b> and was going to Newport.|$|R
50|$|As the Alfa flat-12 {{engine was}} too wide for {{effective}} <b>wing</b> <b>cars</b> designs, Alfa provided a V12 for 1979. It {{was the fourth}} 12cyl engine design that propelled the Austrian in F1 since 1973. Lauda's 1979 F1 season was again marred by retirements and poor pace, even though he won the non-championship 1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix with the Brabham-Alfa. In the single make BMW M1 Procar Championship, driving for the British Formula Two team Project Four Racing (led by Ron Dennis) when not in a factory entry, Lauda won three races for P4 plus the series. Decades later, Lauda won a BMW Procar exhibition race event before the 2008 German Grand Prix.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the first}} race in Melbourne, both Pérez and Kobayashi scored points, {{finishing}} in 7th and 8th place respectively, scoring {{a total of}} 10 points. However, following {{the discovery of a}} non-regulation rear <b>wing,</b> both <b>cars</b> were disqualified and their points were redistributed.|$|R
50|$|The bomb load {{was carried}} in a {{compartment}} in {{the centre of the}} keel. The keel also accommodated the rubberised canvas ballast bags and the main fuel tanks, which could be jettisoned in an emergency. Fuel was pumped from these tanks to individual gravity tanks above each engine car. As a legacy of the loss of the crew of LZ 54 (L 19), two lightweight lifeboats, made of canvas stretched over a wooden frame, were carried. A total of 10 machine guns were carried as defensive armament: three in the forward platform on top of the hull, one in an aft gun position behind the rudders, two in both the forward and aft gondolas and one in each of the <b>wing</b> <b>cars</b> either side of the hull.|$|R

50|$|Vehicles of General Officers {{carried a}} plate 6 inches high by 9 inches wide {{on the front}} right and left rear bumpers, painted red and bearing up to five white five pointed stars. Covered up or removed when vehicle was not {{carrying}} the general. Flags were an alternate, flown on right front <b>wing</b> of <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The airship's hull had 24-sided {{transverse}} ring frames {{for most}} of its length, changing to an octagonal section at the tail surfaces, and the hull had an internal keel which provided an internal walkway and also contained the accommodation for the crew when off duty. For most of the ship's length the main frames were 32 ft 10 in (10 m) apart, with two secondary frames in each bay. Following the precedent set by LZ 120 Bodensee, crew and passenger accommodation was in a compartment near the front of the airship that was integrated into the hull structure. Each of the five Maybach VL I V12 engines occupied a separate engine car, arranged as four <b>wing</b> <b>cars</b> with the fifth aft on the centerline of the ship. All drove two-bladed pusher propellers and were capable of running in reverse. Auxiliary power was provided by wind-driven dynamos.|$|R
5000|$|Small {{airships}} {{carry their}} engine(s) in their gondola. Where there were multiple engines on larger airships, these {{were placed in}} separate nacelles, termed power cars or engine cars. To allow asymmetric thrust to be applied for maneuvering, these power cars were mounted towards {{the sides of the}} envelope, away from the centre line gondola. This also raised them above the ground, reducing the risk of a propeller strike when landing. Widely spaced power cars were also termed <b>wing</b> <b>cars,</b> from the use of [...] "wing" [...] to mean being on the side of something, as in a theater, rather than the aerodynamic device. These engine cars carried a crew during flight who maintained the engines as needed, but who also worked the engine controls, throttle etc., mounted directly on the engine. Instructions were relayed to them from the pilot's station by a telegraph system, as on a ship.|$|R
50|$|The DB2 debuted at the New York Auto Show in April 1950 and {{continued}} in production until April 1953, {{by which time}} 411 had been made. The first 49 had a chrome-framed front grille in three separate parts, and large rectangular cooling vents in the front <b>wings.</b> Subsequent <b>cars</b> had a one-piece grille with horizontal chrome slats, and no side vents.|$|R

50|$|Mark 3 {{cars were}} {{prepared}} in competition version only. The Electromotive 3.0 twin turbo engine developed 1000 horsepower. The cars had {{independent rear suspension}} and inboard disc brakes. A full flat bottom with rear diffuser, air jacks, telemetry and data acquisition were fitted. The body was wider, longer and was delivered with adjustable front and rear <b>wings.</b> The <b>car</b> weighed 2000 pounds in FIA GT2 trim.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bodywork}} must be of an [...] "open wheel" [...] configuration {{and there}} are limitations on both the position {{and size of the}} front and rear <b>wings.</b> The <b>car</b> must have a flat floor between the front and rear wheels and the minimum weight of the combined car and driver (racing weight) is either 510 kg or 530 kg depending on the age of the car.|$|R
50|$|Months {{before the}} race, {{a number of}} drivers {{including}} world champion Jody Scheckter, wanted to boycott the event due to safety concerns with the nearly 5-mile Interlagos circuit. The improvements made to the circuit made in 1978 and 1979 were {{not good enough for}} the drivers, as the circuit was still extremely bumpy (which the circuit was well known for) and the catch-fencing and barriers surrounding the circuit were not perceived to be adequate to protect the drivers from the embankments and ditches around the circuit. The side skirted-ground effect <b>wing</b> <b>cars</b> at the time were not stiffly sprung yet, and had a tendency to bounce up and down over bumps, making them rather intolerant and of such a rough surface as Interlagos's was, and this made the cars very unpleasant to drive there. The drivers even claimed the surface was so bad that it was actually dangerous to drive those cars at the Sāo Paulo city-located circuit, and although Scheckter and the other concerned drivers nearly succeeded in stopping the race, it went ahead.|$|R

50|$|The South African Grand Prix, held on 7 February at the Kyalami Circuit near Johannesburg, was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} {{the first round of the}} 1981 Formula One championship - but it was eventually stripped of its championship status. The ongoing FISA-FOCA war resulted in Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) insisting on a date change which was not acceptable to the race organisers. Approval was ultimately given for the race to go ahead on its original date but as a Formula Libre race rather than as a round of the Formula One World Championship. The downgraded race was supported by the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA) aligned teams but not by the teams of the manufacturers, whose allegiances lay with FISA. This race was run with the cars running in 1980-specification trim, with the ground-effect <b>wing</b> <b>cars</b> of the time, equipped with sliding skirts that increased their downforce by ensuring the air under the car did not escape from under the car, where the most important airflow was. This race, run in wet conditions, was won by the Argentine driver Carlos Reutemann in a Williams-Ford.|$|R
50|$|The body, {{which had}} no doors, was metal over an ash frame and had a pointed tail which held the spare wheel and cycle type front <b>wings.</b> Later <b>cars</b> had a more {{conventional}} rear with a slab-type fuel tank. The exhaust pipe was routed outside the car and finished with a spectacular fishtail. The record-breaking cars had a streamlined cowl over the radiator, {{but this was not}} usually fitted to later cars as it could cause overheating unless high speeds were maintained.|$|R

50|$|The amphitheatre's central, river-side {{location}} is very valuable. Cheshire County Council purchased an {{area to the}} south of the exposed area for Chester's new County Court, the northern <b>wing</b> and <b>car</b> park of which were built over the south western corner of the arena. Despite the council's insistence that the court cover as little of the arena as possible, the work was widely unpopular with residents and the press, especially following the Council's previous support of excavation projects. In 2007 the southern half of the amphitheatre remained covered by Dee House and the County Court.|$|R
