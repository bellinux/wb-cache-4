Intensive land {{management}} such as removing vegetation (e.g. final cuttings) exposes terrains to water and <b>wind</b> <b>induced</b> <b>erosion.</b> Particularly erosion is a critical ecological problem in areas with steep slopes. Erosion risks are much dependent on site specific factors; however, current methods for assessing such risk are somewhat limited (Pawelzik et al. 2013). In Finland, operations such as ditching of peatland and maintenance of ditches as well as preparation of soil for reforestation can cause erosion, which could be prevented by water protection methods (Haahti et al. 2014). In general, soil erosion is not regarded as a significant problem in Finnish forests.|$|E

The coastal fronts near St. Paul and St. George Islands and the coastal domains encircled by the fronts, featured specific taxonomic composition of planktonic algae, high abundance and production of phytoplankton, as well as large numbers of heterotrophic nanoplankton. The coastal fronts were also characterized by high values of total mesozooplankton biomass, high concentrations of Calanus marshallae, as well as relatively high abundances of Parasagitta setosa and Euphausiacea compared to surrounding shelf waters. We hypothesize that <b>wind</b> <b>induced</b> <b>erosion</b> of a weak thermocline in the inner part of the coastal front as well as transfrontal water exchange in subthermocline layers result in nutrient enrichment of the euphotic layer in the coastal fronts and coastal domains in summer time. This leads to prolonged high primary production and high phytoplankton biomass. In this paper a new type of front – the shelf partition front located 45 - 55 km to the north-east off St. Paul Island is described which is assumed to be formed by the flux of oceanic domain waters onto the shelf. This front features a high abundance of phytoplankton and a high level of primary production compared to the adjacent middle shelf. Near the southwestern periphery of the front a mesozooplankton peak occurred, composed of C. marshallae, with biomas...|$|E

However, agricultural activities on the steep lands have resulted in increasing of soil erosion and also leading to significant externalities such as sedimentation of waterways and reservoir, nutrient losses in runoff water, and decline in down-stream water quality (Midmore et al., 1996).

After obtaining the wind speed and rainfall data, the monthly rainfall erosivity is calculated using the rainfall erosivity model introduced by Dumsday and Huang (1992).

40|$|The {{incidence}} of wind erosion and its affect on soil {{organic carbon content}} was assessed in a dryland farming system near Jerramungup, Western Australia, using remote sensing, ground observations and soil analysis. Relationships {{were found between the}} patterns of wind erosion, past geomorphic processes and an array of soil attributes. These associations can be used to identify those soils that are most susceptible to erosion and thus soil carbon loss. Despite strong evidence of relict aeolian activity associated with a previous more arid climate, the {{incidence of}} contemporary wind erosion was only partly related to past geomorphological processes. Quartzose dune sands were particularly susceptible to erosion (47 % of total area eroded), whereas texture contrast soils formed on clayey, wind-formed lunettes (16 %) and deeply weathered regolith were less eroded (34 %). Soils formed on stripped regolith and on loamy surfaced lunettes and swales were not eroded. Wind erosion was strongly related to soil particle size distribution and surface horizon depth, only occurring on sandy surfaced soils, with 50 cm deep. The incidence of erosion markedly increased with small decreases in clay and silt contents below these thresholds. Wind erosion resulted in the loss of ∼ 3 % of the total stock of carbon to 1 m depth or 3. 6 t C ha- 1 for the eroded soils. The consideration of <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>induced</b> carbon loss, both from the standpoint of sustaining farmland productivity and also in producing accurate national carbon accounts, at both the project and national scales, requires resolution...|$|R

A deep understanding the phenomenal of the Fundamental physics was important to understand for improving the effective remedies to resolve. This Concept was firstly observed several decades ago.

As aggregation readily depletes small particles, one explanation might be that dust is continuously generated by larger bodies in the midplane and transported {{to the surface of}} the disks. In general, in a first step of this scenario, the larger bodies have to be destroyed again and different mechanisms exist with the potential to accomplish this. Possible destructive mechanisms are fragmentation in collisions, erosion by gas drag or light <b>induced</b> <b>erosion.</b> In laboratory experiments we find that the latter, light <b>induced</b> <b>erosion</b> by Knudsen compression and photophoresis, can provide small particles. It might be a preferred candidate as the dust is released into a low particle density region.

The density difference introduces stratification state that requires treatment in the parameterization of turbulence.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are (1) to present experimental measurements of <b>wind</b> <b>induced,</b> vertical dispersion in Lake Brielle, The Netherlands, and (2) to examine the utility of a euphotic—dark zone model for investigation {{of the effects of}} dispersion and sedimentation on algal growth and phosphate cycling in shallow lakes. A tracer technique was used to measure dispersion (D) caused by a moderate wind of 4 m/s. The resulting values ranged between 4 and 6 cm 2 /s and compared well with that predicted from theory. The latter objective was accomplished by comparing the results of a simple, two compartment model with those using a more complex, but more descriptive, finite difference model which accounts for the algal concentration gradient induced by growth, dispersion and sedimentation. Simulations showed good agreement in computation of the average euphotic and dark zone algal concentrations between the two models for D ranging from 0 to 6 cm 2 /s and for a sedimentation rate constant, Ks, of 0. 002 and 0. 02 m/h. The results of simulations suggest that rapid algal growth occurs most readily in calm weather when <b>wind</b> <b>induced</b> dispersion in negligible.

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} a delta or estuary are mainly governed by discharges of rivers and water level at the sea (or lake) boundaries. A joint probability approach is widely applied to quantify the high water level frequency in deltas. In the approach the relevant hydrodynamic loading variables, namely the astronomical tides, the <b>wind</b> <b>induced</b> storm surge and the river flows, are jointly investigated. The joint probability distribution is used to generate {{a large number of}} scenarios of boundary conditions which can drive a deterministic model to derive the water levels at locations of interest. The resulting water levels as well as their associated joint probabilities can be inverted to the high water level frequency curve. However, in the joint probability distribution, marginal distributions may contain large statistical uncertainties due to their relevant parameters being estimated from a limited length of data. In the case of the Rhine Delta, a nonparametric bootstrap method is applied to quantify the statistical uncertainties in three critical marginal distributions: <b>wind</b> <b>induced</b> storm surge peak level, <b>wind</b> <b>induced</b> storm surge duration and River Rhine discharge.

On the one hand, plasma <b>induced</b> <b>erosion</b> can seriously limit the lifetime of the wall components, while, on the other hand, eroded particles can be transported into the core plasma where they lead to dilution of the fusion plasma and to energy losses due to radi-ation. Low-Z wall materials induce only small radiation losses in the plasma core but suer from large physical sputtering rates. Carbon based materials in addition suer from chemically <b>induced</b> <b>erosion.</b> High-Z wall materials show signicantly smaller erosion but lead to large radiation losses. One of the main goals of present plasma{wall studies is to nd a special choice of wall materials for steady state plasma scenarios that will provide an optimum with respect to fuel dilution, radiation losses, wall lifetime and fuel inventory in the walls.
