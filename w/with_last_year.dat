Off it, the Annual General Meeting of the club, held at Jenkins Street Board School in July 1892, heard that [...] "skilful management, good matches, and capital 'gates had combined to produce a statement of financial affairs [...] "distinctly creditable to managers and players", and the directors were to be congratulated. The club's application for election to the Football League First Division when it was expanded to 16 clubs was unsuccessful, but it was one of 12 clubs, mostly from the previous season's Football Alliance, elected to compete in the inaugural season of that league's Second Division. Alfred Jones had been acting as club secretary on a voluntary basis since 1885, when payment of players was first permitted.
