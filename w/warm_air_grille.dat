50|$|The grand {{staircase}} is marble, and {{the decorations}} {{are inspired by}} the frescoes of Pompeii and Herculaneum, although the wall-design {{at the bottom of}} the stairs appears to be Egyptian revival. The dining room is now the temporary exhibition gallery. It has a classical style marble fireplace, and a plaster frieze featuring the royal coat of arms. The Regimental Museum occupies the original drawing room suite. Below the library was the billiard room, accessible from the bottom of the staircase, through the red door on the right. The 1867 block has <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> <b>grilles</b> in the skirting boards, and the heating was probably provided by a boiler. However there is a legend that hot air was ducted from the Haley Mill nearby. On the floors of the marble gallery and the chapel lobby are encaustic tiles by Maw & Co. of Staffordshire.|$|R

Many dual-slot graphics card designs blow the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> through the cover of the adjacent slot. There are also some aftermarket coolers that do this. Some CPU cooling designs blow the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> directly towards the back of the case, where it can be ejected by a case fan.|$|R
50|$|An {{inversion}} {{occurs when}} the normal temperature (<b>warm</b> <b>air</b> below, cold air above) profile is reversed, creating a stable configuration of dense, cold air sitting below lighter, <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> An elevated inversion layer is thus a region of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> above a region of cold air, but higher in the atmosphere (generally not touching the surface).|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{describes the}} basic information about <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating and general recommendations for using {{this type of}} heating. The next chapter contents {{a summary of the}} advantages and disadvantages of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating. The following chapters deal with the main elements of the whole system. There is also pointed out the difference between radiant and convective heat transfer. At the end of this thesis there is shown an overview of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating systems used for last years. Last part tells about prospects of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating according authorâ€™s opinion...|$|R

50|$|An exposed {{fan coil}} unit may be wall-mounted, {{freestanding}} or ceiling mounted, and will typically include an appropriate enclosure to protect and conceal the {{fan coil unit}} itself, with return <b>air</b> <b>grille</b> and supply <b>air</b> diffuser set into that enclosure to distribute the air.|$|R
50|$|Warm fronts occur {{where the}} <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> pushes out a {{previously}} lodged cold <b>air</b> mass. The <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> overrides the cooler air and moves upward. Warm fronts {{are followed by}} extended periods of light rain and drizzle, because, after the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises above the cooler air (which remains on the ground), it gradually cools due to the air's expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation.|$|R
5000|$|Thermals {{are caused}} by local {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, or impurity concentration in the vertical. Temperature differences can cause <b>air</b> currents because <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than cooler <b>air,</b> causing the <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> to appear [...] "lighter." [...] Thus, if the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is under the cool air, air currents will form as they exchange places. Air currents are caused because of the uneven heating of Earth's surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundary}} layer {{is the part}} of the atmosphere which is closest to the ground. Normally, the sun heats the ground, which in turn heats the air just above it. Thermals form when this <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises into the cold <b>air</b> (<b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than cold air), a process described by convection. A convective layer such as this has the potential for cloud formation, since condensation occurs as the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises and cools.|$|R

40|$|Good {{ventilation}} {{system in a}} bus passenger compartment is important for providing clean, healthy air and comfortable micro-environment for passengers. Lack of fresh air inside the bus compartment could increase the contaminant concentration level and affect the passenger's health. This research presents field measurement on contaminant concentration level of particulate matter and carbon monoxide inside the passenger compartment of a university's shuttle bus. The field measurements were conducted at the front, middle and rear locations of the passenger compartment. Computational fluid dynamics software was used to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of the bus passenger compartment. Two cases of <b>air</b> return <b>grilles</b> location namely three <b>air</b> return <b>grilles</b> and four <b>air</b> return <b>grilles</b> were performed. The results show that four <b>air</b> return <b>grilles</b> could reduce the contaminant concentration levels of CO and PM 1 inside the bus passenger compartment...|$|R
50|$|Cold fronts {{occur when}} {{a mass of}} cooler air dislodges a mass of <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> This type of {{transition}} is sharper, since cold air is more dense than <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> The rain duration is shorter, and generally more intense, than that which occurs ahead of warm fronts.|$|R
50|$|The Air Jordan XXI {{model of}} shoes was {{designed}} by DWayne Edwards and inspired by sport touring vehicles. The shoe features lower-foot <b>air</b> <b>grilles,</b> double-overlasted Phylon midsole, a carbon fibre shank plate and a seamless diamond-quilted booty. It also has a tenable I.P.S. suspension system that lets the wearer choose between Zoom and Encapsulated air.|$|R
50|$|This term {{describes}} device cooling by the convection {{currents of}} the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> {{being allowed to}} escape {{the confines of the}} component to be replaced by cooler <b>air.</b> Since <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> normally rises, this method usually requires venting at the top or sides of the casing to be effective.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime <b>air.</b> These <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the <b>warmest</b> <b>air</b> masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in <b>warm</b> and tropical <b>air</b> from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional analysis for thermal comfort in a library. The room model includes library layout, equipment and peripheral positions {{as well as}} the positions of inlet and outlet air for IAQ controls. Cold clean air is supplied to the room through ceiling-mounted <b>air</b> <b>grilles</b> and exhausted through <b>air</b> <b>grilles</b> situated on the same ceiling. A commercial CFD package was used in this study to achieve solutions of the distribution of airflow velocity and temperature. Using high quality meshes is vital to the overall accuracy of the results. Simulation results show a good agreement with experimental data from the literature. This study has thoroughly analysed the indoor thermal conditions and airflow characteristics of the building. In addition, verification of the CFD program with experimental data showed that the program can provide reasonable and reliable predictions on thermal comfort performance with the help of precise boundary conditions...|$|R

50|$|A {{warm front}} is also {{defined as the}} {{transition}} zone where a <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> mass is replacing a cooler <b>air</b> mass. <b>Warm</b> fronts generally move from southwest to northeast.

50|$|Burning {{wood fuel}} {{in an open}} fire is both {{extremely}} inefficient (0-20%) and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion. In {{the same way that}} a drafty building loses heat through loss of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> through poor sealing, an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> out of the building.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} {{it is the}} {{relatively}} high elevation of the Short Hills Bench which allows it to benefit from rising <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> currents blowing south off Lake Ontario, {{in much the same}} way as the lower lying coastal sub-appellations do. This <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> has a moderating effect on the mesoclimate, protecting the tender buds from potentially damaging frosts.|$|R
50|$|Combustion (e.g., fireplace, gas heater, candle, oil lamp, etc.) consumes oxygen while {{producing}} {{carbon dioxide}} and other unhealthy gases and smoke, requiring ventilation air. An open chimney promotes infiltration (i.e. natural ventilation) because of the negative pressure change induced by the buoyant, <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> leaving through the chimney. The <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is typically replaced by heavier, cold air.|$|R
50|$|Stack {{ventilation}} - Cross ventilation is {{an effective}} cooling strategy, however, wind is an unreliable resource. Stack ventilation is an alternative design strategy that relies on the buoyancy of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> to rise and exit through openings located at ceiling height. Cooler outside air replaces the rising <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> through carefully designed inlets placed near the floor.|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} design of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating and {{ventilating}} system for low energy house.

Then problems of residential building ventilation and possibilities of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating systems including heat recovery are presented. In the next chapter summary of ventilating units with heat recovery and <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating units for residential low energy buildings and pasive family houses is presented. Calculation of low energy house heat losses, which is solved, is based on CSN 06 0210, CSN 73 0540 and CSN EN 12831 standards. Design and calculation of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating and ventilation system and ground heat exchangers is also described.

5000|$|Cold fronts {{form when}} a cooler air mass moves {{into an area}} of <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> {{in the wake of}} a {{developing}} extratropical cyclone. The <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> interacts with the cooler air mass along the boundary, and usually produces precipitation. Cold fronts often follow a warm front or squall line. Very commonly, cold fronts have a warm front ahead but with a perpendicular orientation. In areas where cold fronts catch up to the warm front, the occluded front develops. Occluded fronts have an area of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> aloft. When such a feature forms poleward of an extratropical cyclone, it is known as a trowal, which is short for TRough Of <b>Warm</b> <b>Air</b> aLoft. [...] A cold front is considered a warm front if it begins to retreat ahead of the next extratropical cyclone along the frontal boundary, and called a stationary front if it stalls.|$|R
