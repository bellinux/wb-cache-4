5|$|The {{southern}} colonies can be culturally {{divided between}} the uplands and the lowlands, and this distinction is seen in diet and food preparation in the two regions. The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, white potatoes, while most affluent whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because they were associated with, and reflected the social inferiority of, black slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits on their table for breakfast, along <b>with</b> <b>healthy</b> portions of pork. Salted pork was a staple of any meal, as it {{was used in the}} preparations of vegetables for flavor, in addition to its direct consumption as a protein.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} his leaving the premiership Chamberlain's health began to fail; he {{resigned}} from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940. Dunglass had volunteered for active military service, seeking to rejoin the Lanarkshire Yeomanry shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had {{a hole in his}} spine surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone. Without surgery he would have been unable to walk within a matter of months. An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced <b>with</b> <b>healthy</b> bone from the patient's shin.|$|E

5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared <b>with</b> <b>healthy</b> individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
5|$|When news reached Bonaparte that Ganteaume had {{returned}} to Toulon for a second time, he once again issued orders for the admiral {{to go to sea}} and fulfill his original orders to resupply the Egyptian garrison. On 27 April, the French force sailed for the third time, with seven ships of the line, two frigates, a corvette and two storeships. Before sailing to Egypt Ganteaume first cruised off Elba in the Ligurian Sea, achieving regional superiority long enough that a force was able to cross to the island from Piombino, rapidly subduing all but the fortress of Porto Ferrajo, which was besieged. Ganteaume's ships bombarded the fortress on 6 May, but an outbreak of typhus in the squadron significantly reduced its operational effectiveness. Ganteaume therefore divided his force, taking four ships <b>with</b> <b>healthy</b> crews south, while Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, and the frigate Créole were all too undermanned to perform efficiently, and were sent back to Toulon. Having reorganised his force, Ganteaume passed through the Straits of Messina on 25 May. On 5 June off Brindisi, the squadron sighted and chased the British frigate HMS Pique under Captain James Young, which was able to effect an escape to Alexandria and warn Keith of Ganteaume's approach. A planned rendezvous off Brindisi with three Neapolitan frigates did not occur, and by 7 June the squadron was close enough to Egypt for Ganteaume to send his corvette Héliopolis to investigate the situation at Alexandria.|$|E

40|$|Does {{the health}} of banks on Wall Street affect {{economic}} outcomes on Main Street? After the 2008 - 09 financial crisis, bank lending to nonfinancial firms declined significantly, with effects on employment and incomes. Drawing on data from over 2, 000 firms, Gabriel Chodorow-Reich finds that credit restrictions accounted for between one-third and one-half of the employment decline at small and medium firms in the year following the Lehman bankruptcy. He also finds that the ‘stickiness’ of bank-borrower relationships meant that many firms that that had pre-crisis links <b>with</b> less <b>healthy</b> lenders suffered more than those that had relationships <b>with</b> <b>healthier</b> ones...|$|R

25|$|Three {{experimental}} studies were conducted that demonstrate a threshold for acute gastrointestinal upset of approximately 4–5nbsp&mg/L in healthy adults, {{although it is}} not clear from these findings whether symptoms are due to acutely irritant effects of copper and/or to metallic, bitter, salty taste.

25|$|An IVF {{technique}} {{known as}} mitochondrial donation or mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) results in offspring containing mtDNA from a donor female, and nuclear DNA {{from the mother}} and father.

The composite egg is then fertilized with the male's sperm. The procedure is used when a woman with genetically defective mitochondria wishes to procreate and produce offspring <b>with</b> <b>healthy</b> mitochondria.

25|$|The goal of {{gene therapy}} studies is to virally {{supplement}} retinal cells expressing mutant genes {{associated with the}} Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype <b>with</b> <b>healthy</b> forms of the gene; thus, allowing the repair and proper functioning of retinal photoreceptor cells {{in response to the}} instructions associated with the inserted healthy gene. Clinical trials investigating the insertion of the healthy RPE65 gene in retinas expressing the LCA2 Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype measured modest improvements in vision; however, the degradation of retinal photoreceptors continued at the disease-related rate. Likely, gene therapy may preserve remaining healthy retinal cells while failing to repair the earlier accumulation of damage in already diseased photoreceptor cells. Response to gene therapy would theoretically benefit young patients exhibiting the shortest progression of photoreceptor decline; thus, correlating to a higher possibility of cell rescue via the healthy inserted gene.|$|E
25|$|Age is a {{major risk}} factor for most common {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. While much {{research has focused on}} diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the aging brain (usually spelled ageing brain in British English) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. Recent reports in model organisms suggest that as organisms age, there are distinct changes in the expression of genes at the single neuron level. This page is devoted to reviewing the changes associated <b>with</b> <b>healthy</b> aging.|$|E
