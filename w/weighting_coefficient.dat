50|$|The {{resonance}} {{structures in}} the VB model are particularly useful in predicting the effect of substituents on π systems such as benzene. They lead to the models of resonance structures for an electron-withdrawing group and electron-releasing group on benzene. The utility of MO theory is that a quantitative indication of the charge from the π system on an atom {{can be obtained from}} the squares of the <b>weighting</b> <b>coefficient</b> ci on atom Ci. Charge qi ≈ c. The reason for squaring the coefficient is that if an electron is described by an AO, then the square of the AO gives the electron density. The AOs are adjusted (normalized) so that AO2 = 1, and qi ≈ (ciAOi)2 ≈ c. In benzene, qi = 1 on each C atom. With an electron-withdrawing group qi < 1 on the ortho and para C atoms and qi > 1 for an electron-releasing group.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} orbital theory, the main alternative to valence bond theory, {{the equivalent of}} the symmetry-adapted linear combination role of resonance is the linear combination of atomic orbitals. In MO theory, the {{molecular orbital}}s (MOs) are approximated as sums of all the atomic orbitals (AOs) on all the atoms; there are as many MOs as AOs. Each AOi has a <b>weighting</b> <b>coefficient</b> ci that indicates the AO's contribution to a particular MO. For example, in benzene, the MO model gives us 6 π MOs which are combinations of the 2pz AOs on each of the 6 C atoms. Thus, each π MO is delocalized over the whole benzene molecule and any electron occupying an MO will be delocalized over the whole molecule. This MO interpretation has inspired the picture of the benzene ring as a hexagon with a circle inside. When describing benzene, the VB concept of localized sigma 'bonds' and the MO concept of 'delocalized' π electrons are frequently combined in elementary chemistry courses.|$|E

In this paper, we proposed a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to jointly investigate the tradeoff between throughput and backhaul energy efficiency (BEE) using !-fair utility function for two different backhauling technologies in downlink transmission scheme of a two-tier HetNets. We then transform the proposed MOP into a single objective optimization problem (SOP) employing the weighted sum method to obtain the complete Pareto Frontier solution set with minimum QoS requirements and rate fairness level !. The transformed SOP is solved in an iterative manner using Lagrangian Dual Decomposition (LDD) with a subgradient method providing a near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in reducing the total area power consumption irrespective of the backhauling technology by dynamically adjusting <b>weighting</b> <b>coefficient</b> and rate fairness level !.

In the latter case, we find that the J-test also has power against violation of weak exogeneity (with respect to the short-run coecients of the null model), which is caused by correlation between the disturbance of the null model and that of the cointegrating equation linking x 1 t and x 2 t. Moreover, unlike the previous case, the OLS estimator of the <b>weighting</b> <b>coefficient</b> from the articial compound model converges at p T to an asymptotic normal distribution when the null model is correctly specified.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an indicator}} for estimating international reserves adequacy in Ukraine {{taking into account}} its unique characteristics. The proposed indicator was constructed based on the modification of IMF adequacy metric by changing weighting coefficients of potential balance of payments vulnerabilities based on historical data for Ukraine and by the inclusion of import as an additional component. In comparison to the IMF metric our indicator implies greater international reserves. This {{is due to the}} fact that balance of payments of Ukraine is very sensitive to current account shocks such as worsening terms of trade so our indicator except import component has increased <b>weighting</b> <b>coefficient</b> of export earnings. Also, compared to the IMF metrics our indicator provides more weighting coefficients of the other portfolio liabilities and the money supply that represents the sensitivity to financial account shocks. Reduced <b>weighting</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the short-term debt could be explained by the partial refinancing of external debt.
