25|$|In {{the same}} 1908, Grabar {{abandoned}} painting {{in favor of}} writing; he became chief editor and writer for Joseph Knebel's series of books on Russian artists and Russian towns. He quickly amassed a wealth of historic evidence and settled on publishing a comprehensive History of Russian Art. Grabar initially concentrated on project management alone, leaving principal writing to Alexander Benois, but when the latter stepped aside in May, Grabar was compelled {{to pick up the}} <b>writing</b> <b>task.</b> He now concentrated on architecture; only then did he realize that Russian architecture of the 18th century and earlier periods had never been properly studied. Grabar locked himself in the archives to study the subject for a year; in July 1909 he took a short leave from writing and designed the Palladian Zakharyin Hospital in present-day Khimki, which was completed by the onset of World War I and operates to date.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer for}} this episode, David A. Goodman, said that making this episode was a [...] "dream come true" [...] for {{many members of}} the crew {{including}} himself. At the time he was hired onto the staff, they were already talking about creating a Star Trek-centric episode. The initial idea was to have a giant Kirk and Spock fighting over New York-New York Hotel and Casino. Executive producer David X. Cohen assigned the <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> to Goodman, as they agreed he was the biggest Trek fan of the group. They agreed to drop the story idea with the giant characters and gave him two weeks to write the script. The deadline was complicated as Goodman had to spend the first week on jury duty, and then broke his ankle. Despite this, he described [...] "Where No Fan Has Gone Before" [...] as the most fun he has ever had writing a script.|$|E
2500|$|At Harvard, he {{had made}} friends there who helped him in his {{publishing}} efforts. His first major <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> was to develop an English-language revision of his earlier book on revolutions, and he soon published Out of Revolution: Autobiography of Western Man [...] in 1938. George Allen Morgan, a former Harvard student under Alfred North Whitehead and himself {{the author of the}} classic What Nietzsche Means, subsequently assisted Rosenstock-Huessy in the preparation of The Christian Future or the Modern Mind Outrun [...] in 1946. Further, Whitehead had strongly supported Rosenstock-Huessy in his disagreements with members of the Harvard faculty.|$|E
30|$|The <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in the 2013 {{university}} {{entrance examinations}} were classified into micro-genres. Then, {{the frequency of}} each micro-genre {{that appeared in the}} <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> was counted.|$|R
30|$|The ethnographic {{approach}} to English language learners was not adopted in this study. More {{information on the}} influences of the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> would be gained if researchers could interview learners or conduct a questionnaire on how the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> and the texts affect their learning. This may reveal how much attention learners pay to the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks.</b> This study employed fifty <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in the examinations of universities in central Japan. More samples from other areas in Japan would perhaps build more reliability into data on the range of micro-genres required in the examinations. This study, further, examined only the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> set in 2013. An examination of tasks in multiple years may offer a more precise range of micro-genres than that found in the present study.|$|R

2500|$|While still {{serving in}} the navy, Warnke teamed up with San Diego evangelist Morris Cerullo and was touted for his [...] "Satanist experience". Warnke and Cerullo toured the country {{participating}} in charismatic revival meetings. Cerullo {{wanted to write a}} book about youth occultism, and assigned the <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> to David Balsiger with help from Warnke. In early 1972, Warnke requested and received an early discharge from the navy as a conscientious objector so that he could work full-time in the ministry. Warnke then left Cerullo's ministry to start his own, forbidding Cerullo to use any of his material. It was at this time that Warnke and Balsiger went on to write the book that would make Warnke famous.|$|E

50|$|Prewriting varies {{depending}} on the <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> or rhetorical mode. Fiction requires more imagination, while informational essays or expository writing require stronger organization. Persuasive writing must consider not just the information to be communicated, but how best to change the reader’s ideas or convictions. Folktales will require extensive reading of the genre to learn common conventions. Each <b>writing</b> <b>task</b> will require a different selection of prewriting strategies, used in a different order.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{findings from the}} technology-supported implementation of triangulated <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in a pilot interdisciplinary subject for construction disciplines in a Hong Kong university, and discusses these findings {{in relation to the}} broader issues of collecting, assessing, and reporting evidence of student learning in higher education. The <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> were writing-intensive activities delivered through Blackboard Learn 9. 1, including 5 ePortfolio-based (TreeDBNotes 3. 38) individual writing assignments, at least 1 individual blog entry, and 1 end-of-semester group report. 53 students from all departments within the Faculty of Construction and Environment participated in the study. The study was driven by two questions: (i) how might these technology-supported <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> provide triangulated data to demonstrate student learning? (ii) what kinds of other learning evidence could be collected from these <b>writing</b> <b>tasks?</b> The directed content analysis of these <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> found that (i) a longitudinal inclusion of various technology-supported <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> had a positive effect on the attainment of the subject learning outcomes, and that (ii) the educational issues associated with student learning processes and others could also be determined from them. These results suggest that the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> piloted here can serve as a rigorous alternative for demonstrating evidence of student learning. More studies are needed on the generalizability of such an alternative.

40|$|We {{assessed}} whether <b>written</b> <b>task</b> analyses {{would serve}} as textual prompts for performing functional tasks by persons with mild disabilities. Several variables that could influence the effectiveness of textual prompts to promote stimulus control were examined across four groups. A consistent finding was that <b>written</b> specific <b>task</b> analyses combined with end-of-trial performance feedback were effective for promoting the acquisition and generalization of several tasks. Performance transferred immediately to natural discriminative stimuli when the <b>written</b> <b>task</b> analyses and feedback were withdrawn for most tasks and participants. For 2 participants, transfer of stimulus control was accomplished by prompt fading, using individualized <b>written</b> <b>task</b> analyses either with or without performance feedback (Group 1). When feedback was not provided, the effectiveness of <b>written</b> specific <b>task</b> analyses was inconsistent across groups. In contrast to the controlling effects of <b>written</b> specific <b>task</b> analyses, <b>written</b> generic <b>task</b> analyses, which specified only major task outcomes, when combined with performance feedback (Group 1) did not control responding. Overall, this research demonstrated the effectiveness of <b>written</b> specific <b>task</b> analyses and performance feedback to promote stimulus control for persons with mild disabilities...|$|R

30|$|In this section, the {{findings}} of the analysis are discussed with regard to the previous research on English <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in university entrance examinations in Japan and the previous studies into appropriate micro-genres in educational settings. The four micro-genres found in the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> of the Japanese entrance examinations were compared with results from previous research into the classification of the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in Japanese entrance examinations and the question of whether those micro-genres are an appropriate set of micro-genres for the Japanese university entrance examinations was investigated. Firstly, the question of how similar or different {{the findings}} in this article were with those of Kowata’s (2009) study was explored. Kowata (2009) followed Bain’s (1890) classification of texts, which consists of narrations, descriptions, expositions, and argumentations to analyse the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in the Japanese university entrance examinations. ‘Expositions’ in Bain’s classification are similar to the term, ‘explanations’ adopted in this article. Kowata (2009) found that most of the tasks were argumentations (70.0  %) followed by narrations (10.0  %), expositions (9.33  %), descriptions (5.33  %), and others (5.33  %). The findings of his study and this article are similar in that the most common task type is persuasive writing. Most of the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> in the examinations, 83.9  %, examined in this article may be categorised into Bain’s argumentations when the tasks of expositions, discussions and opinion and imaginary in personal reflections in the present study are combined together. The small differences may have occurred as the two studies took place in different years; this study examined the examinations in 2013 and Kowata’s study looked into university examinations in 2006. This article, however, identifies communicative purpose in greater detail than Kowata did. Thus, the <b>writing</b> <b>tasks</b> which were categorised into argumentations in Kowata’s study can be further classified into micro-genres such as expositions, discussions, and personal reflections.|$|R
