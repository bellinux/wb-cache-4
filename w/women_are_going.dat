Courses for <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be shortened {{and they are going}} to be directed toward preparation for specific types of war service. ...

[...] In several {{interviews}} Mars furthered the concept: [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} my dad who loved doo-wop music", those sounds are [...] "straight to the point" [...] and simple, they rely on a [...] "beautiful melody and voice" [...] with a connection, that represents his romantic side.

[...] Mars stated in an interview with MTV News that he had been working on his debut album and it was completed by the date of the interview.

2500|$|Another {{example of}} Verfremdungseffekt {{in the music}} is in the [...] "Alabama Song". This time, instead of the music {{sounding}} deeply disturbing compared to the stage action, it is the reverse. When the [...] "Alabama Song" [...] first appears, the <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to Mahagonny. The second time the song appears is {{near the end of}} the opera, after Jimmy has been executed. Mahagonny is in decline, and there are street protests. The entire stage is singing about how rotten the world and man are, when all of a sudden Jenny and the prostitutes come walking through singing the [...] "Alabama Song", a total departure from the previous mood. What is more, they are carrying Jimmy's corpse through the stage. The music refuses to set and keep the audience in a particular mood, and the conflict between the lighthearted [...] "Alabama Song" [...] and the imagery of the funeral procession is confusing. This tension serves to distance the audience from the action, even at an exceptionally powerful moment of the opera, giving the audience one last chance to digest all the contradictions and perversions of Mahagonny.|$|E

That is, {{and always has}} been, their career; and, what is more, they know it; and even at college, while they are {{studying}} algebra and political economy, they have their eye on it sideways all the time. The plain fact is that, after a girl has spent four years of her time {{and a great deal}} of her parents' money in equipping herself for a career that she is never going to have, the wretched creature goes and gets married, and in a few years she has forgotten which is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, and she doesn't care.

I suppose that the North American conscience was evolved from the rudimental European conscience during the first centuries of struggle here, and was more or less religious and economical in its origin. But with the advance of wealth and the decay of faith among us, the conscience seems to be simply conscientious, or, if it is otherwise, it is social. The eternal-womanly continues along the old lines of housekeeping from an atavistic impulse, and no one woman can stop because all the other <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on. It is something in the air, or something in the blood. Perhaps it is something in both." ...|$|E

In a way she's been let out from womanhood, forced out of womanhood, and I see now that when women are let out from womanhood there's no putting them back. I could give a lecture on Anna. I see now that if <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be wives and mothers and homekeepers and ladies, they must be got ready for it from the beginning, sheltered, never really let out into the wild chances of life. She has been. Bitterly. She's REALLY emancipated. And it's let her out {{into a sort of}} nothingness. She's no longer a woman, and she isn't a man.

Out we come, looking for the fun the men are having. Dress us, feed us, play with us! We'll pay you in excitement,--tremendous excitement. The State indeed! All your little triumphs of science and economy, all your little accumulations of wealth that you think will presently make the struggle for life an old story and the millennium possible--we spend.
