25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
500|$|Although Miller was on {{the roster}} for all three series in the Cardinals' 2013 postseason run, manager Mike Matheny did not place him in the {{starting}} rotation. [...] Instead, he totaled a single inning in one relief appearance against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2013 National League Division Series (NLDS), in which he gave up one home run. [...] Matheny rebuffed the suggestion {{that he was a}} [...] "misspent asset" [...] on the 25-man roster. [...] He specified that, [...] "He's going to be a guy we’re going to use if we get into a situation where we’ve got a bunch of innings to eat up, whether it's at the front end or back. [...] He's going to be our guy (if) <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> things together." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought that is really not fair and I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E

500|$|Drummer Mullen said of {{the song}} in 1983:"We're into the {{politics}} of people, we're not into politics. Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit {{around the table and}} talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009 Seymour told Patrick Donovan of The Age [...] "It was {{a pretty}} serious {{decision}} to retire, and all {{the guys in the}} band are heavyweight professionals in their respective areas of employment.

2500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Viva la Vida" [...] are narrated by a protagonist {{who says he}} [...] "used to rule the world". Martin has {{explained}} the song lyric [...] "I know Saint Peter won't call my name" [...] {{in an interview with}} Q magazine: [...] "It's about... You're not on the list," [...] When asked about the song, bass guitarist Guy Berryman said: [...] "It's a story about a king who's lost his kingdom, and all the album's artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas. There's this slightly anti-authoritarian viewpoint that's crept into some of the lyrics and it's some of the pay-off between being surrounded by governments on one side, but also we're human beings with emotions and we're all going to die and the stupidity of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with every day. Hence the album title." ...|$|E

5000|$|The label {{was more}} about {{distribution}} than entrepreneurship. [...] "I really didnt care {{one way or}} another whether there was a proper label on the record, but theres been discussion about doing distribution across the pond, and the (distribution) company in England only works with labels, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it on there", Stenz explained.|$|R

2500|$|In December 2009, Gamereactors Bengt Lemne {{mentioned}} {{stories of}} developers waiting long {{amounts of time}} for their titles to be published on Xbox Live Arcade, to which Lead and Gold producer Robert Bäckström responded [...] "we really want to release {{it as soon as}} possible, [...] things might take time." [...] On August 3, 2010 Mark Wester, CEO of the game's publisher Paradox Interactive cited issues with getting the game certified for release on Xbox Live Arcade. [...] "It seems like <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it on the backburner," [...] Wester said, further stating that the team was [...] "not really putting any more effort into releasing on XBLA." [...] The reason for the delay was not mentioned, merely that Paradox and FatShark were waiting for response from Microsoft on Lead and Golds status. This led some websites to list the game as cancelled or removed the Xbox Live Arcade listing entirely.|$|E
2500|$|With Brian Luckhurst injured Colin Cowdrey {{volunteered to}} open the innings with David Lloyd and {{withstood}} the wild first overs of Dennis Lillee (2/59) and Jeff Thomson (5/93). So many of the balls were short that {{only two or three}} had to be played each over and runmaking came slowly as the batsmen concentrated on survival. Lloyd was caught in the box by a bouncer from Thomson that failed to rise, doubled up in pain for five minutes and was helped off by the England physiotherapist Bernie Thomas. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, the bowler's 50th first class wicket, with the score 62/1. Mike Denness had replaced Lloyd and despite Doug Walters' low expectations, [...] "Oh Christ, don't tell me <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with that Mike Denness for a couple of balls again", he and Tony Greig lasted the day with his team on 102/1. After a rest day the innings resumed in 37°C heat on the fourth day, but the game was effectively over when four wickets fell in the first hour. Greig repeated his slashing policy of the First Test until he was caught by Greg Chappell off Thomson. He was replaced by Lloyd who saw Denness edge the same bowler to Redpath, then Fletcher to Marsh to give him 3/8 in three overs. Greg Chappell caught Knott and Lloyd, Luckhurst came out to bat with his broken hand, but was caught by Mallett off Lillee after a stand of 63 with the gallant Fred Titmus (61). With nothing to lose Chris Old thrashed 2 sixes and 5 fours, taking 20 runs off one over from Max Walker and making 43 of the 64 runs added with Titmus for the eight wicket, which ensured that Australia would have to bat again. Geoff Arnold was Thomson's fifth victim and Greg Chappell took Titmus off Mallett (2/32) to give him a seven catches in a Test, breaking the record for a fielder held by his grandfather Vic Richardson amongst others. England made 293, forcing Australia to make 21 runs for victory.|$|E

Arrigo Sacchi {{describes}} Real Madrids need for a holding midfielder. In 2000, he was recruited by Real Madrid. His transfer was controversial because Celta did not want to sell Makélélé unless a substantial improvement on their offer was made. Makélelé refused to train until there was resolution of his contract. Finally, Celta were reluctantly forced to sell him for €14 million, far less than their valuation of the player.|$|R
