5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|R

500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone <b>who</b> <b>watches</b> this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E

[...] Vedder said that [...] "Cropduster" [...] is [...] "about man's giant ego, that he's the most important thing on the planet." [...] Regarding [...] "Green Disease", Vedder stated he was [...] "mystified" [...] at CEO and corporate-management salaries and [...] "how someone can justify taking that much at the cost of other people's livelihoods."

500|$|According to Marissa G. Muller of Rolling Stone, Gaga [...] "was at {{her most}} {{accessible}} during the show, sharing {{the difficulties of}} life on the road and her love of the holidays – specifically, how she grew up watching the Muppets and has had a long love for Kermit. The whole affair was relatively conservative for Gaga and weirdly progressive for the Muppets". Muller wrote that the special was aired at an opportune moment for Gaga, since Artpop sales had dropped 82 percent in its second week and the show was hoped to woo back her audience. She called the opening performance of [...] "Venus" [...] one of its top moments. Mark Graham wrote for VH1 that Gaga had a lack of relatability at that point in her career: [...] "To her credit, [...] seems to have recognized this flaw in her brand strategy and has been working overtime of late to humanize herself ... <b>who</b> <b>watches</b> the cable premiere of Lady Gaga & The Muppets Holiday Spectacular ... will definitely gain a new appreciation for [...] ". Maricela Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly called Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular a [...] "cross-promotional commercial", enabling Gaga to promote Artpop and enhancing the Muppets' popularity. Gonzalez described it as [...] "equal parts warm, fuzzy, cynical, and depressed by consumerism overtaking the so-called 'holiday spirit'. But why fret? It’s Lady Gaga and the Muppets!" ...|$|E

When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone <b>who</b> <b>watches</b> the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the way I was treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E
