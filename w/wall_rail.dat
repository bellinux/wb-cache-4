40|$|As a kind {{of modern}} vehicle, more and more subway lines appear {{in order to meet}} the need of urban transportation. Abuilding Beijing subway line 10 is traversed by a thermal {{pipeline}} in China. To ensure the progress and safety of the subway tunnel, the deformation monitoring of the tunnel structure is necessary. The terrestrial laser scanning technology is applied to monitor the deformation of subway tunnel structure. The paper puts forward a method of three-dimension integral deformation monitoring of subway tunnel structure. This method can obtain the three-dimension integral deformation tendency, which help to provide mechanics analysis on the deformation of tunnel construction and provides the technical support for the design, construction and management. The monitoring project is introduced. Firstly, within the deformation district of subway tunnel, the annular closed survey control network is set along the line of the up-down rail. Secondly, put a set of cross section every 3 m to 5 m following the middle line of tunnel. Set the reflection sheets on the arch, vertical <b>wall,</b> <b>rail</b> subgrade, etc. Then collect the point clouds information by three-dimension lidar scanner. After data joint and registering, the three-dimension model of tunnel structure is established. Thirdly, adopt automatic electronic total station to monitor the deformation of tunnel structure by fixed stationing. Finally, according to data processing and analysis using a model interpolation method, the deformation of subway tunnel is fitted finally. Thus we can obtain the 3 D image of the subway deformation in a precision, stereo and visual way. 1...|$|E
50|$|The {{premise of}} the game is {{identical}} to the previous variants of the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series: the player cruises the highways of Japan at night, while challenging opponents to impromptu battles. When the race begins, each vehicle has a health meter which slowly drains if players' opponent is ahead of them or if they collide with <b>walls,</b> <b>rails,</b> or other vehicles. The race is over when one vehicle's health meter runs out no matter how long (time & distance) the race lasts. The race could also end prematurely if the player and the AI racer(s) drive in separate directions when the highway splits. This results in a draw.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{accident}} {{did not occur}} on the oval section of the track, the high speeds were deemed unsafe and F1 use of the oval was ended; future Grands Prix were held on the shorter road circuit, with the banking appearing one last time in the film Grand Prix. New safety <b>walls,</b> <b>rails</b> and fences were added before the next race and the refuelling area was moved further from the track. Chicanes were added before both bankings in 1966, and another fatality in the 1968 1000 km Monza race led to run-off areas added to the curves, with the track layout changing the next year to incorporate permanent chicanes before the banked curves - extending the track length by 100 m.|$|R

25|$|The {{infrastructure}} for a renewed airlift, however, {{was kept in}} place and was constantly improved until German reunification. The runway was extended in the 1960s and an instrument landing system (ILS) for runway 26 was installed. At {{the end of the}} 1980s, shortly before the fall of the Berlin <b>Wall,</b> the <b>rail</b> siding received an extensive lighting system.|$|R
50|$|Initially the {{ambience}} was {{a mixture of}} New Orleans bordello and futuristic fantasy. Marbled patterns papered the <b>walls,</b> with <b>rails</b> carrying an assortment of brightly coloured clothes. Lace curtains draped the doorway of its single changeroom, and a beaded glass curtain hung over the entrance at the top of steps, which led on into the shop. In the back room, an Art Deco Wurlitzer blasted out a selection of music.|$|R

25|$|The {{guideway}} was uni-directional, {{with all}} vehicles {{traveling around the}} airport in a counter-clockwise direction. The top of guideway <b>walls</b> contained <b>rails</b> that steered the vehicles. Small urethane wheels {{on either side of}} the vehicle engaged the rail and were mechanically linked to a conventional steering suspension on the main wheels. Switching was provided by switching bars {{on either side of the}} guideway that raised or lowered to trap one of the two sets of guidance wheels under them. The switch was adapted from existing fail-safe switches used on railways.|$|R
50|$|The {{replacement}} {{bridge was}} built on the same alignment as the original bridge, but with larger dimension in length, width, and height. This will allow for additional railway tracks and larger vehicles to travel beneath the bridge, and heavier vehicles are able to cross the bridge. The design included a span length of more than 80 m, footpaths, noise <b>walls,</b> guard <b>rails,</b> and electrification screens. The project was funded by the state government, with tenders called for in January 2014 and work likely to begin a few months later, and taking approximately one year.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} firstly {{constructed}} in 1896 and opened on 20 April 1902 with {{service on the}} Western Line. The station was a single-story wooden structure with Japanese style with slant roof and rain-shield <b>walls.</b> The <b>rail</b> line connected to the station roughly divides Chiayi City into two regions. The region located {{in front of the}} station prospered as the city business district, while the region located behind the station was scarcely developed. Service to the Alishan Forest Railway began in 1912 from the station. The station was renovated in June 1933 to its current structure.|$|R

50|$|BuildAbility then {{subcontracted}} {{work for}} the construction of the concrete shell to O'Donnell, who assembled two tower cranes {{at either end of the}} site. O'Donnell used a formwork construction technique in partnership with PERI Ltd. to construct the cores, columns and basement <b>walls.</b> A <b>rail</b> climbing system was installed, which provided a scaffolding cage around the workforce during building. Lifting platforms were used to reduce the space occupied by scaffolding. An aluminium fast slab formwork system named Skydeck was used to construct the floorplates. BuildAbility decided to use unbonded post-tensioned concrete, an uncommon system in the UK, for the floorplates as this allowed them to be thinner and reduced construction time.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1990s, {{the school}} {{district}} decided the building was no longer suitable {{for use as a}} school. Partial remodeling done in 1987 did not overcome original design issues, and further modernizing was not considered financially viable. The school district initiated the process for listing the building by commissioning an assessment by architects Gerald A. Doyle & Associates. Their report concluded the building was no longer [...] "ideal" [...] for use as a school but had [...] "significant architectural and historical significance". The report documented original features including floors, stairs, brickwork, window and door frames, ceilings, interior <b>walls,</b> chair <b>rails,</b> picture moldings, slate chalkboards, light fixtures, and the school bell. Restoration of these features was estimated to cost $411,000.|$|R

40|$|This degree {{project has}} been carried out by Oscar Adolfsson and Marcus Blomqvist, during the spring of 2010, both {{studying}} to become Bachelor of Science in Innovation and Design Engineering, at Karlstad University. The degree project includes 22, 5 credits. The work is done on behalf of Etac Supply Center AB in Anderstorp. Etac is a company developing and manufacturing home health care products, with operation in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England and Germany, and with sales worldwide. Bo Lindqvist, R & D manager has been the contact person at Etac. During the project the students has had a workplace at Semcon Caran AB in Karlstad. Semcon has also been helpful as a sounding board. The objective of the work has been developing a new, wall mounted shower chair, assigned for persons with difficulty to stand up while showering. Etacs requirement of the shower chair is that it should be able to support a user with a weight of 100 kg, the chair shouldn’t have any outrigger, optional should be armrests and backrest. The seat should be mountable in existing bathrooms, and act as a complement for the current shower seats sold by Etac. It’s very important that the result is good looking, and appealing to new target groups. In the start of this project, the students have been carrying through a benchmarking, mainly at the NordBygg fair in Stockholm. The students have been agreeing about the lack of products with both functionality and aesthetic appealing qualities. The result is adjusted to fit the most common wall constructions in Sweden. Four concepts have been developed, and among these four, one is the final result. The final result consists of two aluminium <b>wall</b> <b>rails</b> and a plastic seat. A plastic backrest, and armrest in both plastic and stainless steel are optional. During the work, the specifications on products like these, from the Swedish institute of assistive technology, concerning strength and risks of pinching has been observed. The project has resulted in CAD-files and a model in scale 1 : 3, manufactured by Etac...|$|R
