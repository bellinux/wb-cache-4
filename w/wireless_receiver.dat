25|$|In 2002, Nintendo {{introduced}} the WaveBird Wireless Controller, the first wireless gamepad {{developed by a}} first-party console manufacturer. The RF-based wireless controller is similar in design to the standard controller. It communicates with the GameCube {{by way of a}} <b>wireless</b> <b>receiver</b> dongle connected to one of the console's controller ports. Powered by two AA batteries, which are housed in a compartment {{on the underside of the}} controller, the WaveBird lacks the vibration functionality of the standard controller. In addition to the standard inputs, the WaveBird features a channel selection dial – also found on the receiver – and an on/off switch. An orange LED on the face of the controller indicates when it is powered on. The controller is available in light grey and platinum color schemes.|$|E
25|$|Windows HotStart (formerly Windows Direct {{and also}} known as Direct Media Mode) enables a user to {{immediately}} launch an application after startup or resume by the press of a button or by <b>wireless</b> <b>receiver</b> events; {{it is designed to}} provide the instant on feature availability that is traditionally associated with mobile devices such as cell phones and portable media players. HotStart enables what Microsoft has referred to as appliance-like availability, allowing a PC to take on a number of roles based on the type of application launched—a PC that boots into a multimedia application, for example, can essentially function as a dedicated media device. Original equipment manufacturers can customize HotStart hardware implementation and functionality. Users may also customize application launch functionality through the Windows Registry; instead of launching a multimedia application, a user can, for example, configure a HotStart button or other form of input to instantly launch an e-mail application.|$|E

In the access node, the <b>wireless</b> <b>receivers</b> {{are one of}} the components with high energy consumption level. We can save energy by implementing transmission techniques to receive data in some periods of times, and switching off the <b>wireless</b> <b>receivers</b> the rest of time. However, this strategy will result in increased access delay for packets waiting in the BSs until transmission to the access node.

25|$|The Xbox 360 Wireless Headset is a {{wireless}} headset {{designed for the}} Xbox 360 and Xbox Live; it is manufactured by Microsoft. It {{can be used for}} in game voice chat, private chat, audio for video chat and in game voice recognition. Up to four wireless headsets can be used simultaneously on a single Xbox 360. The headset fits over either ear and comes with two sizes of removable earloops for a better fit. It uses the same 2.4GHz wireless technology as the Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, so it will work within 30 feet of the console. It can achieve up to eight hours of battery life per charge, with an AC wall adapter or a USB DC charger for recharging. USB chargers are readily available from mobile phone accessory shops. The headset can be used with or without a controller. The headset also produces various beeps to signal different actions and give messages to the user. The headset is also compatible for use with a PC via the Microsoft <b>Wireless</b> <b>Receiver.</b> Up to 4 wireless headsets and wireless controllers can be used in conjunction at any one time.

2500|$|Guglielmo Marconi {{made the}} first transatlantic {{wireless}} transmission originating in the United States from Cape Cod, at Wellfleet. The beach below the bluffs where his station was located is now called Marconi Beach. [...] In 1914, he began {{construction of a new}} transatlantic <b>wireless</b> <b>receiver</b> station in Chatham and a companion transmitter station in Marion. [...] In 1920, the stations were acquired by RCA and, in 1921, Chatham began operations as a maritime radio station communicating to ships at sea using the callsign WCC. [...] WCC supported the communications of Amelia Earhart, Howard Hughes, Admiral Byrd, and the Hindenburg. Marconi chose Chatham due to its vantage point on the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded on three sides by water. Walter Cronkite narrated a 17-minute documentary in 2005 {{about the history of the}} Chatham Station.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the period}} after [...] (Operation Beach Party), 52 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Fourth Balloon Wing, {{developed}} a III Wing practice of co-operation during artillery observation, by having balloon observers direct preliminary ranging, until shells were landing {{close to a}} target, then handing over to the aeroplane observer for the final corrections of aim. When the air observer had ranged the guns, the balloon observer took over again. The new method economised on aircrew and {{had the advantage of}} telephone communication between the ground and the balloon, since aircraft wireless could only transmit. Air co-operation with Royal Engineer sound ranging was also practised. A line of microphones were connected to a receiving station further back and activated by a forward observer. Air observers routinely sent [...] "NF" [...] by wireless and a position report when German batteries were seen to be firing and since German shelling often cut off the ground observer from contact with the rear, the sound-ranging station was equipped with a <b>wireless</b> <b>receiver</b> and used receipt of [...] "NF", to activate the sound ranging apparatus. The device could also be used to identify the position of German artillery, when the air observer was unable accurately to indicate the position of the guns; balloon observers also assisted the ranging section, by reporting gun flashes.|$|E

Next generation multiuser <b>wireless</b> <b>receivers</b> will need to use low computational complexity algorithm in order to perform both fast signal detection and error estimation. Several multiuser signal detection algorithms have proposed for next generation <b>wireless</b> <b>receivers,</b> which are designed to give good performance in terms of {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) and bit error rate (BER), are discarded for a direct implementation as they have high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity TM algorithm {{that can be used to}} perform fast signal detection for multiuser wireless receives. This reduction in computational complexity would likely to give us a considerable improvement in the performance of multiuser <b>wireless</b> <b>receivers</b> such as high computing power and low error rate. In addition, we also present a formal mathematical proof for computational complexities that verifies the low-complexity of the proposed algorithm Key words...|$|R

The rest of the vessels never fired a shot. They began to blow up, everywhere, before our eyes. Several swerved about and started back, but they failed to escape. The destroyer, Dart XXX, nearly made the ten-mile limit when she blew up. She was the last survivor.

Several signal detection and estimation algorithms have been proposed for next generation <b>wireless</b> <b>receivers</b> which are primarily designed to provide reasonable performance in terms of {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) and bit error rate (BER).
