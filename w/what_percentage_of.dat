25|$|Producers {{and sellers}} of popcorn {{consider}} two major factors {{in evaluating the}} quality of popcorn: <b>what</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For both these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.|$|E

500|$|Torn {{was to use}} a {{modified}} version of the SPECIAL system; combat occurred in quasi-real-time, rather than strictly being turn-based. To achieve this, Black Isle Studios created the [...] "recovery system", in which action points were used to determine the amount a combatant could accomplish in a given amount of time. Action points were spent with each action, and based on <b>what</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> an acting character's total action points were used, that character would need to wait a varying amount of time before taking action again. For example, if two characters expend half of their action points, they will attack each other at the same speed, regardless of the point totals for each character. Exceptions to this were to include recovery being hindered by movement, using items, or switching equipment, which was always allowed, though it reset the recovery time.|$|E
500|$|By region, the Central Highlands {{lost the}} {{greatest}} number of lemur species. [...] Although it has lost nearly all of its woodland habitat, some lemur species still survive in isolated forest patches. Lemur diversity is tightly linked with plant diversity, which in turn decreases with increased forest fragmentation. In extreme cases, treeless sites such as the town of Ampasambazimba from the central region no longer support any of the lemur species represented in their subfossil record. However, other locations no longer have giant subfossil lemurs, yet they still maintain forested habitat that could support them. [...] Even though the giant lemurs have disappeared from these locations, while the smaller species survive in the forest patches that remain, the subfossil remains indicate that the living species used to be more widespread and coexisted with the extinct species. [...] Although the Central Highlands saw the greatest species loss, it was not the only region or habitat type to witness extinctions. However, the least-understood region is the eastern rainforests, which have not yielded subfossil lemur remains. [...] Consequently, {{it is impossible to know}} <b>what</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> lemur taxa were recently lost there, although studies of Malagasy customs (ethnohistory) along with archaeological evidence suggests the eastern rainforests were more ecologically disturbed in the past than they are today. [...] Hunting and trapping by humans may have severely impacted large lemurs in this region as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{curve is}} a graph showing the {{proportion}} of overall income or wealth assumed by the bottom x% of the people, although this is not rigorously true for a finite population (see below).

40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on the {{citation}} analysis of graduate masters theses from Carleton University 2 ̆ 7 s Biology Department with implications for library collection management decisions. Twenty-five masters theses were studied to determine citation types and <b>percentages,</b> ranking <b>of</b> journals by frequency of citation and by number of authors citing, and by age range of journal citations. The researcher examined <b>what</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> journals were accessible through the local catalogue and conducted further analysis of specifics regarding unavailability. Journals were also ranked by subject specialty. Results indicate that although the library has many of the journal articles cited, knowing why a citation was unavailable is useful for establishing future purchasing needs. Although journal rankings are traditionally performed using total number of citations, the ranking by number of authors citing a source can make a difference when compiling core journal lists. The researcher concludes by discussing implications for collection development in times of fiscal constraint...|$|R
5000|$|The {{range of}} {{possible}} economic micromanagement techniques is much wider than for combat, because strategy games' economies work {{in so many different}} ways. If the game uses [...] "worker" [...] units to gather resources and / or build things (a common technique in real-time strategy games), one must make sure none are idle and that they are doing the right things, and must avoid letting enemy raiders destroy them. In some turn-based games one tells colonies <b>what</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> their efforts to put into various activities such as industrial growth, research, and building defenses or combat units; as colonies grow or the strategic situation changes, one has to check and adjust these ratios. In Sid Meier's Civilization series, it may be important for either economic or military reasons to build railroads as fast as possible, and doing this efficiently requires considerable micromanagement of Settler / Engineer units.|$|R

50|$|To {{fight against}} other empires, players require ships and ground troops.

Different battle tactics can be used, which give bonuses and change the range of engagement. Players can also retreat from battle, saving their ships {{at the cost of}} taking some damage. Players can also invade by sending their ground troops to fight against defenders for a system.

Replenishing ground troops requires manpower, a special resource, and each ship can only carry so many soldiers. Players can also weaken an enemy system's defenders by waiting by the system for several turns, which decreases the amount of enemy troops. The player can also use certain battle tactics as well, which give certain bonuses but also certain negatives.|$|R

50|$|All {{fluoridation}} methods, including water fluoridation, create {{low levels}} of fluoride ions in saliva and plaque fluid, thus exerting a topical or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg/L several times during a day. Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls {{the rate at which}} they develop. When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5, a fluorapatite-like remineralized veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be. The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after tooth eruption. Although some systemic (whole-body) fluoride returns to the saliva via blood plasma, and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid, there is little data to determine <b>what</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> fluoride's anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms. Also, although fluoride affects the physiology of dental bacteria, its effect on bacterial growth {{does not seem to be}} relevant to cavity prevention.|$|R
