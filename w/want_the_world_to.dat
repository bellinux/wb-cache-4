500|$|Hurt: The EP {{garnered}} a mixed {{response from}} music critics. Lewis Corner for Digital Spy was complimentary of Lewis's rock song interpretations.

He continued to write that [...] "Hurt" [...] has a [...] "compelling beauty" [...] and [...] "haunting quality". Corner cited her cover of [...] "Iris" [...] as a [...] "surprise highlight," [...] writing that she quivers the lyrics [...] "And I don't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> see me/ 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand," [...] over a piano. He described [...] "Colorblinds composition as a [...] "symphony of strings." [...] Rhetta Akamatsu for The Times of India wrote that Lewis's renditions were [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "spectacular". Akamatsu described [...] "Hurt" [...] as a song which features [...] "chills and thrills as the rawness of the lyrics meets the purity of Lewis's voice." [...] She also noted that Lewis's version {{is not based on}} the arrangement of the original by Nine Inch Nails, but rather that of Johnny Cash's cover, which was included on his 2002 album [...] Akamatsu concluded her review of the songs with [...] "All three performances feature intense, literate lyrics and are well-suited to Lewis's style." ...|$|E

500|$|Delhi police {{registered}} {{a criminal}} case against {{the editor of a}} Delhi-based tabloid, Mail Today, for disclosing the female victim's identity, as such disclosure is an offence under section 228(A) of Indian Penal Code. Shashi Tharoor, then a union minister, suggested that if the parents had no objection, her identity could be made public, with a view to showing respect for her courageous response by naming future laws after her, but Tharoor's remark created controversy. Speaking to a British press reporter on 5 January, the victim's father was quoted as saying, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> know her real name. My daughter didn't do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter." [...] Indian law forbids revealing the name of a rape victim unless the family agrees to it and, following the news article which published the father's reported quote and the victim's name, some news outlets in India, Germany, Australia, and the United States also revealed her name. However, the following day Zee News quoted the father as saying, [...] "I have only said we won't have any objection if the government uses my daughter's name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed than the existing one." ...|$|E

[...] It would have suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him. To a stranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general; yet I sometimes saw in him a man whom I had not seen before, and I did not know whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a child, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or of stupidity. A townsman told me that when he met him sauntering through the village in his small close-fitting cap, and whistling to himself, he reminded him of a prince in disguise.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{a typical}} paper as the British Labour Leader, for example, may {{be read in}} vain, number after number, for any sound and sincere {{constructive}} proposal.

It just wants effort to stop--even {{at the price of}} German victory. If the whole fabric of society in western Europe were to be handed over to those pseudo-socialists to-morrow, to be administered for the common good, they would fly the task in terror. They would make excuses and refuse the undertaking. They do not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> go right. The very idea of the world going right does not exist in their minds.

And most of his faculties being quenched or blasted for the moment, he wrote perhaps his greatest, or his innermost, truth.--"I don't want my Fate or my Providence to treat me well. I don't want kindness or love. I don't believe in harmony and people loving one another. I believe in the fight and in nothing else. I believe in the fight which is in everything. And if {{it is a question of}} women, I believe in the fight of love, even if it blinds me.
