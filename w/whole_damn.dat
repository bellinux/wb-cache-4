[...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand {{after his}} presentation, several of Bush's aides and {{supporters}} walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide {{commented that the}} President had [...] "that look that he's ready to blow". Colbert recalled that [...] "not {{a lot of people}} laughed in the front row" [...] during the speech, and that [...] "when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking to me in the <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> room"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's imitation of a gesture the justice had recently been photographed making.|$|E

500|$|The {{hearing was}} dramatized in a 1964 play by German playwright Heinar Kipphardt, In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer {{objected to the}} play, {{threatening}} suit [...] and decrying [...] "improvisations which were contrary to history and {{to the nature of}} the people involved", including its portrayal of him as viewing the bomb as a [...] "work of the devil". His letter to Kipphardt said, [...] "You may well have forgotten Guernica, Dachau, Coventry, Belsen, Warsaw, Dresden and Tokyo. I have not." [...] Of his security hearing, he said, [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> thing was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 13, 1945, Dresden {{became the}} target of Allied forces. In the hours and days that followed, the Allies engaged in a fierce firebombing of the city. The {{offensive}} subsided on February 15, with around 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut marveled {{at the level of}} both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground. [...] "It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around", Vonnegut said. [...] "When we came up the city was gone... They burnt the <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> town down." [...] Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble. He described the activity as a [...] "terribly elaborate Easter-egg hunt".|$|E
500|$|Kemper {{then left}} the scene in Hallett's car, driving eastward, leaving California and through Nevada and Utah. He arrived in Pueblo, Colorado and, after not hearing any news on the radio about the murders {{of his mother and}} Hallett, found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he {{personally}} knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited in his car for the police to arrive, arrest him and take him into custody, where he then also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked after his arrest what motivated him to turn himself in, Kemper said: [...] "The original purpose was gone... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off." ...|$|E

I don't care if the <b>whole</b> <b>damned</b> beach was littered with mermaids--not the <b>whole</b> <b>damned</b> beach! We've got our reputation to keep up. See?...

[...] Mitch Myers wrote in 1997: 'Everybody is a star, but Borland's {{cinematic}} life is well worth watching.'

2500|$|The Comic Relief {{publication}} of the complete Blackadder scripts (Blackadder: The <b>Whole</b> <b>Damn</b> Dynasty 1485–1917) contains [...] "Baldrick's Family tree", which mainly comprises all the children of a Baldrick being called Baldrick. Occasionally there are some exceptions. Some of the other entries in Baldrick's family tree include the common cold, dung beetles, ticks, Earls Court (change for Ealing), Ruislip, Pot plant, Paul Gascoigne, Ronald Reagan and his children Ronnie and Thingie. A neolithic ancestor {{by the name of}} Bad Reek is mentioned as being present at the construction of Stonehenge. The sixth wife of Henry VIII is also claimed to be a Baldrick, on account of the king being [...] "old, half-mad and suffering from syphilis at the time, [...] was happy to get anything he could".|$|E

5000|$|Nor was Andersson quite {{satisfied}} with his own work; in 2008, when he received the Carnegie Art Award first prize of SEK 1,000,000, he said: [...] "I've worked hard my <b>whole</b> <b>damned</b> life, sacrificing myself and so much else for the art. This prize is no confirmation that I have succeeded, but perhaps a little hint about it". Torsten Andersson died aged 82 in Hörby in 2009.|$|R
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the rematch, Louis visited President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the White House.

[...] In his 1976 biography, Louis wrote, [...] "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own {{personal}} reasons and the <b>whole</b> <b>damned</b> country was depending on me." [...] This time, Louis took training for the bout seriously, giving up golf and women throughout his training.|$|R
2500|$|German First Lieutenant Paul Jürgen Vollmer, {{commander}} of the First Battalion, 120th Landwehr Infantry, emptied his pistol trying to kill York while he was contending with the machine guns. Failing to injure York, and seeing his mounting losses, he offered in English to surrender the unit to York, who accepted. By {{the end of the}} engagement, York and his seven men marched 132 German prisoners back to the American lines. [...] Upon returning to his unit, York reported to his brigade commander, Brigadier General Julian Robert Lindsey, who remarked [...] "Well York, I hear you have captured the <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> German army." [...] York replied [...] "No sir. [...] I got only 132." [...] His actions silenced the German machine guns and were responsible for enabling the 328th Infantry to renew its attack to capture the Decauville Railroad.|$|E

2500|$|John L Walters in The Guardian {{calls the}} album [...] "an all-out {{assault on the}} senses", stating that [...] "this is the least [...] "smooth" [...] jazz album in years".

The BBC review states that this album is [...] "the first classic of the post-jazz movement" [...] and descrive an album of [...] "life-affirmingly dumb shrieks, stomps and power chords". Ian Mann writes that Last Chance Disco is [...] "one of the albums of 2005 in any genre, and highly recommended to adventurous rock fans as well as hardcore jazz followers" [...] in his review. Stylus Magazine wrote in their review that [...] "the <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> album is just great ... a relentless ska-punk-jazz-metal conglomeration that shouldn’t work but does".|$|E
