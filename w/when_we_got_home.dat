2500|$|Lake {{joined his}} first band, Unit Four, playing cover songs as their singer and guitarist, through 1965. Following their split, Lake and Unit Four bassist Dave Genes formed another covers group, the Time Checks, until 1966. He {{then became a}} member of The Shame, where he is {{featured}} on their single, [...] "Don't Go Away Little Girl", written by Janis Ian. During his stay in Carlisle for a gig, Lake contracted pneumonia and continued to perform on stage. His bandmates refused to drive back home that night, leaving Lake to sleep in the van where he [...] "woke up blue... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I was nearly dead... That was probably the worst I went through". Following a brief stint in the Shy Limbs, by 1968 Lake was involved with The Gods, based in Hatfield, which he described as [...] "a very poor training college", but the group secured a residency at the Marquee Club in London. Lake left the group in 1968 over creative differences as the band were to enter the recording studio. Their keyboardist Ken Hensley later said that Lake [...] "was far too talented to be kept in the background".|$|E

6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{and told}} our story, Father said, [...] "Thank God!" [...] very softly. There were {{tears in his}} eyes. He did not wait for Uncle William to come down, but went to Monkshead himself the next day.|$|E

He grew up not in Plains, as is widely believed, but in Archery, Georgia, on his parents 2 ̆ 7 farm. This {{photograph}} was taken in 1926, when he was two. Jimmy Carter described his father as a 2 ̆ 2 stern disciplinarian. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 My most vivid memory of a whipping, 2 ̆ 2 Carter wrote in his first autobiography, 2 ̆ 2 was when I was four or five years old. I had been to my Sunday School class, and as was his custom Daddy had given me a penny for the offering. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home,</b> I took off my Sunday clothes and put the contents of my pocket on a dresser. There were two pennies lying there. Daddy thus discovered that when they passed the collection plate I had taken out an extra penny, instead of putting mine in for the offering. That was the last money I ever stole 2 ̆ 2 [Carter, Why Not the Best?, p. 19]. [URL]...|$|R

60|$|After <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I settled up our accounts, {{and charged}} half the sea-beans to Rectus, and half to myself.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> Aunt Sally {{was that}} {{glad to see}} me she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.|$|E
60|$|I {{suggested}} this to Mrs. March <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> and, in {{the need}} of some relief from the tension she had been in, she was fain to accept the theory provisionally, though I knew that her later rejection of {{it would be all}} the more violent for this respite.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{we found}} Hannah Jane and Father and Mother--who had arrived there {{an hour before}} us--simply distracted. They were {{so glad to see}} us safe and sound that they didn't even scold us, and when Father heard our story he laughed until the tears came into his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|I {{took with}} me a local man who knew the ground, and who was trusted to be silent. We made a long detour <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> as near the Silent Tower as we could without being noticed. I made notes from my compass as to directions, and took good notice of {{anything}} that could possibly serve as a landmark. By the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I was pretty well satisfied that if all should go well I could easily sail over the Tower in the dark. Then I had a talk with my wife, and gave her full instructions: ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{she flew}} to the little box upstairs where she kept her treasures, and brought {{therefrom}} the dry and brittle wishbone.|$|R
60|$|Fortune favoured us, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> without {{meeting a}} soul. Once {{we saw a}} man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a {{street in front of}} us. But we hid in a door till he had {{disappeared}} up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or 'wynds', as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she asked, even implored, me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I {{should die}} of hunger. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{to our own}} farmer's we ravaged the pantry for {{everything}} left from supper. It wasn't much. There!" [...] Lindora screamed. [...] "There is the taxi!" [...] And the shuddering sound of the clock making time at their expense penetrated from the street. [...] "Come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wolves are bad beasts. Stephanie was out {{riding in}} the sleigh with papa, {{when they came out}} from a wood and ran after us, and they would have killed us if the horses had not been very fast. Papa shot some of them, but the others did not seem to mind, and were close behind <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> where the men came out with forks and axes, and then they ran away. Stephanie will wait for her breakfast." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, I {{observed}} that evening, as I had observed for some days past, that Ada and Richard {{were more than}} ever attached to each other's society, which was but natural, seeing {{that they were going}} to be separated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent than usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my arms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.|$|E
5000|$|Danny O'Donoghue {{told the}} story behind the song in an {{interview}} with Merrick, Dools & Ricki-Lee on Sydney radio station Nova 96.9. Said O'Donoghue: [...] "The song 'For the First Time' was about a time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back after touring around the world. We wanted to press palms with the people who had really gotten us there, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> and realised there's a stark reality out there, the recession, people are losing their jobs and their valuable things, and we thought, it almost pales in comparison to your news. We started the song, and it ended up being a bit bleak and we felt we really needed a great message in these, to turn it around... so we needed a message of hope, as people are being stripped of all these things they're realizing what's really important. It's all about going back to basics: drinking cheap wine, eating your dinner off the floor. That's when you meet each other for the first time, when you have nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} sure," [...] I answered. [...] "Look here, Jacky," [...] I continued, [...] "supposing I {{wanted to stay}} all day and to go back to-night, so that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> to breakfast to-morrow morning, would that be too long for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{wanted to}} see for myself, and, besides, I was obliged to come," [...] said the doctor; [...] "I {{want to know what}} has {{happened}} since <b>we</b> left. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> late last night, and I have not seen anybody who knows anything." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she began}} to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to another subject, and Lucy was like her old self again. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true enough, ma'am," [...] {{the butler}} said sadly; [...] "and {{it is what}} has pretty nigh broken the squire's heart. He was obstinate like at first, and he took me {{with him when he}} {{travelled}} about across the sea among the foreigners, and when he was at a place they called Athens, he got a fever and he was down for weeks. We came home by sea, and the winds was foul, and we made a long voyage of it, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> there was letters that had been lying months and months for us, and among them was those letters of Master Herbert's.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> again, {{her curiosity}} took another turn. [...] "Exeter?" [...] she said, {{considering}} with herself. [...] "He mentioned Exeter. I am like you--I never was there. What will books {{tell us about}} Exeter?" [...] She despatched Zillah {{to the other side}} of the house for a gazetteer. I followed the old woman into the corridor, and set her mind at ease, in a whisper. [...] "I have kept what you told me a secret," [...] I said. [...] "The man was out in the twilight, as you foresaw. I have spoken to him; and I am quite as curious as the rest of you. Get the book." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "When I {{was twenty}} years old, {{we went to}} the Crows and stole a lot of horses. The Crows {{discovered}} us and followed us all night. <b>When</b> daylight came <b>we</b> saw them behind us. I was the leader. We turned back to fight the Crows. I killed one and took his scalp and a field glass and a Crow necklace from him. We chased the others back a long way and then caught up with our own men again and went on. It was a very cold winter. There were twenty of us and each had four horses. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> them <b>home</b> all right and it was a good trip that time. We had a scalp dance <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back." ...|$|R
5000|$|Galloway {{retired as}} a weekly {{columnist}} for McClatchy Newspapers in January 2010, writing, [...] "I have loved being a reporter; loved it <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right; understood it <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it wrong...In the end, {{it all comes down}} to the people, both those you cover and those you work for, with or alongside during 50 years." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a supper-tray after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at night, and I {{think we}} should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable {{domestic}} occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, [...] "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{the house}} was all dark and still; so we went {{on down to the}} hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when {{anything}} comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I {{sent the}} horse away {{with one of}} my grooms to a farmer's house, to break him {{thoroughly}} in, and told Bryan, who was all anxiety to see his little horse, that he would arrive by his birthday, when he should hunt him along with my hounds; and I promised myself no small pleasure in presenting the dear fellow to the field that day: which I hoped to see him lead some time or other in place of his fond father. Ah me! never was that gallant boy to ride a fox-chase, or to take the place amongst the gentry of his country which his birth and genius had pointed out for him! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>WHEN</b> <b>WE</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> {{breakfast for}} us minor fry {{was waiting in}} our mess-room and the family honored us by coming in to eat it with us. The nice old treasurer, and in fact all three were flatteringly eager to hear about our adventures. Nobody asked the Paladin to begin, but he did begin, because now that his {{specially}} ordained and peculiar military rank set him above everybody on the personal staff but old D'Aulon, who didn't eat with us, he didn't care a farthing for the knights' nobility no mine, but took precedence in the talk whenever it suited him, which was all the time, because he was born that way. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir,--when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> I {{took out}} the medicines, but the pocket-book {{was nowhere to be}} found; and I have been back with James, and we have looked all along the road, and under the hemlock-tree, and we have inquired at the apothecary's; but we cannot find it any where." ...|$|R

60|$|But we were. The sun {{was well}} up <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the exhibition-ground.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> we {{were talking}} of the old time, which we could all look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily married. I took the papers from the safe {{where they had been}} ever since our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of {{material}} of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document. Nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee.|$|E
60|$|As {{for the big}} purple sea-feather, it was a whopper, but too big {{for me to do}} {{anything}} with it. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> Rectus showed it around to the Chippertons, and some of the people at the hotel, and told them that I dived down and brought it up, myself, but I couldn't take it away with me, for it was much too long to go in my trunk. So I gave it next day to Captain Chris, to sell, if he chose, but I believe he took it back and planted it again in the submarine garden, so that his passengers could see how tall a sea-feather could grow, when it tried. I chipped off a piece of the rock, however, to carry home as a memento. I was told that the things growing on it--I picked off all the shells--would make the clothes in my trunk smell badly, but I thought I'd risk it.|$|E
60|$|Windy {{night that}} was I went to fetch her {{there was that}} lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew {{out of my hand}} against the High school railings. Lucky it didn't. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His {{farewell}} concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at four, and dined at five, {{and smoked}} cigars till eight.

2500|$|They {{recall the}} session as being {{accompanied}} by heavy marijuana use.
