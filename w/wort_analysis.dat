40|$|AbstractFusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) caused by Fusarium and Microdochium species can {{significantly}} affect the yield of barley grain {{as well as}} the quality and safety of malt and beer. The present study provides new knowledge on the impacts of the FHB pathogen complex on the malting and brewing quality parameters of naturally infected barley. Quantitative real-time PCR and liquid chromatography double mass spectrometry were used to quantify the predominant FHB pathogens and Fusarium mycotoxins, respectively, in commercially grown UK malting barley samples collected between 2007 and 2011. The predominant Fusarium species identified across the years were F. poae, F. tricinctum and F. avenaceum. Microdochium majus was the predominant Microdochium species in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011 whilst Microdochium nivale predominated in 2009. Deoxynivalenol and zearalenone quantified in samples collected between 2007 and 2009 were associated with F. graminearum and F. culmorum, whilst HT- 2 and T- 2, and nivalenol in samples collected between 2010 and 2011 correlated positively with F. langsethiae and F. poae, respectively. Analysis of the regional distribution and yearly variation in samples from 2010 to 2011 showed significant differences in the composition of the FHB species complex. In most regions (Scotland, the South and North of England) the harvest in 2010 had higher concentrations of Fusarium spp. than in 2011, although no significant difference was observed in the Midlands between the two years. Microdochium DNA was significantly higher in 2011 and in the North of England and Scotland compared to the South or Midlands regions. Pathogens of the FHB complex impacted negatively on grain yield and quality parameters. Thousand grain weight of malting barley was affected significantly by M. nivale and M. majus whilst specific weight correlated negatively with F. avenaceum and F. graminearum. To determine the impact of sub-acute infections of the identified Fusarium and Microdochium species on malting and brewing quality of naturally infected samples, selected malting barley cultivars (Optic, Quench and Tipple) were micromalted and subjected to malt and <b>wort</b> <b>analysis</b> of key quality parameters. F. poae and M. nivale decreased germinative energy and increased water sensitivity of barley. The fungal biomass of F. poae and F. langsethiae correlated with increased wort free amino nitrogen and with decreased extract of malt. DNA of M. nivale correlated with increased malt friability as well as decreased wort filtration volume. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the impact of species such as the newly emerging F. langsethiae, as well as F. poae and the two non-toxigenic Microdochium species should be considered when evaluating the quality of malting barley...|$|E

40|$|Two basic {{categories}} of the spirit drink Tequila can be distinguished according to Mexican law. For the high quality category "Tequila 100 % de Agave" only pure agave juice is allowed to be fermented and distilled. Otherwise, the product is a "Mixto-Tequila", which is manufactured by adding up to 49 % of sugar to the Agave <b>wort.</b> The sensory <b>analysis</b> using ranking methods showed significant differences between Tequila samples of both categories. The premium products with 100 % of Agave were preferred by the test panel. Especially matured products (reposado and añejo Tequilas) had a harmonically mellow aroma and were comparable to premium fruit spirits or whiskies. The worldwide trend leading to a preference of "Tequila 100 % de Agave" should be no longer ignored by the German market dominated so far by Mixto-products...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 1 % of the world’s {{population}} {{live with}} Celiac decease. Celiac decease is an autoimmune decease {{that leads to}} degeneration of the colon wall. There is no cure, and individuals with celiac decease cannot consume products containing gluten. Avearness around the decease have given more gluten free products in everyday stores, in the later years. Today {{there is only one}} Norwegian beer declared gluten free, Ringnes Lite. The selection of gluten free beer produced abroad is wider. This master thesis develops a gluten free beer, by reducing the amount of malt, and replace it with maize flakes. The product cannot be called beer, but a beer like beverage, regardless the theses will refer to the product as beer. It was produced beer with a concentration of malt of 100 %, 5 %, 2, 5 %, 1 % and 0 %. When brewing with a malt concentration under 5 %, the production required adding of rice husk and enzymes, for a good extraction rate after mashing. Measurements with the Anton Paar-instrument showed a low degree of fermentation, at malt concentration under 5 %. The results can be due to low content of vitamins and minerals in the <b>wort.</b> Sensoric <b>analysis</b> reviled a different between the brews. The panellists reported willingness to by the brews if in store. Ridascreen Gliadin Competative ELISA was used to measure gluten, all brews with reduced concentration of malt, was measured under threshold at 20 ppm, and gluten free. M-MA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Psychiatric {{patients}} often {{suffer from}} stress, anxiety and depression. Various plant extracts {{are known to}} fight stress (valerian), anxiety (passion flower) or depression (St. John's wort). NEURAPAS ® balance {{is a mixture of}} these three extracts and has been designed to cover this complex of psychiatric conditions. The study was initiated to quantitatively assess the effect of this combination on brain electric activity. Method Quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) current source density (CSD) recording from 16 healthy male and female human volunteers (average age 49 years) was used in a randomized, placebo-controlled cross over study. Recordings were performed 0. 5, 1. 5, 3 and 4 hours after administration of the preparations under the conditions of 6 min eyes open and 5 min d 2 concentration test, mathematical calculation test and memory test, respectively. All variables (electric power within 6 frequency ranges at 17 electrode positions) were fed into a linear discriminant analysis (eyes open condition). In the presence of mental load these variables were used to construct brain maps of frequency changes. Results Under the condition of mental load, centro-parietal spectral power remained statistically significantly lower within alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 1 frequencies in the presence of verum in comparison to placebo. Discriminant analysis revealed a difference to placebo 3 and 4 hours after intake of 6 tablets of NEURAPAS ® balance. Data location within the polydimensional space was projected into the area of the effects of sedative and anti-depressive reference drugs tested earlier under identical conditions. Results appeared closer to the effects of fluoxetine than to St. John's <b>wort.</b> Conclusions <b>Analysis</b> of the neurophysiological changes following the intake of NEURAPAS ® balance revealed a similarity of frequency changes to those of calming and anti-depressive drugs on the EEG without impairment of cognition.

40|$|New {{malting barley}} {{varieties}} are annually tested for their malting and brewing potential {{according to a}} field trial set-up combined with quality evaluation on pilot scale. To assess the effects of trial year and location on quality evaluation data, a data base consisting of quality data from Dutch malting and brewing trials of new malting barley varieties during the period 1989 - 1995 was analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. It was also determined which parameters gave little or no discrimination among varieties over the years. The analysis showed that strong annual effects occurred over the period observed. A considerable list of 23 analytical parameters from barley, malt, <b>wort,</b> and beer <b>analysis</b> were relevant to explain 50 % {{of the variance in}} the data set. Seven parameters showed hardly any variation and possessed no discriminative value. This indicated that the number of parameters could be diminished to some extent without losing resolving power with respect to quality evaluation. A further reduction is possible when, of two parameters showing high positive or negative correlations, only one is analyzed. Quality data from different trial locations were prone to annual effects. The trends observed showed clustering of data from particular trial locations with discrimination among locations in certain years. From this evaluation, it could not yet be concluded whether or not a limitation in the number of trial sites is feasible. The evaluation offers an approach towards further increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of existing trial systems. © 1998 by the American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc...|$|R
