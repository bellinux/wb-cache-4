5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars.

Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star.

5|$|The superb fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs {{or groups of}} 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. The group consists of a social pair <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they {{may not necessarily be}} the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.|$|E
5|$|A queen will mate <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> males, {{and during}} colony {{foundation}} she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. The {{life cycle of}} the ant from egg to adult takes several months. Myrmecia workers exhibit greater longevity in comparison to other ants, and workers are also able to reproduce with male ants. Myrmecia {{is one of the}} most primitive group of ants on earth, exhibiting differentiated behaviours from other ants. Workers are solitary hunters and do not lead other workers to food. Adults are omnivores that feed on sweet substances, but the larvae are carnivores that feed on captured prey. Very few predators eat these ants due to their sting, but their larvae are often consumed by blindsnakes and echidnas, and a number of parasites infect both adults and brood. Some species are also effective pollinators.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, a geisha {{was paid}} {{for the number of}} senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been {{consumed}} while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. The seal was a wooden or stone disk <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> grooves etched in it into which incense was placed. These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of incense, directly related {{to the size of the}} seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.|$|E

5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E
5|$|The holotype, MACN Pv-RN 20, {{is a right}} mf2 {{according}} to both Krause and colleagues (1992) and Gurovich (2005), but Gurovich considered the side that Krause and colleagues thought was lingual to be labial, and vice versa. The latter interpretation {{is used in the}} following description. It is almost square, but at the front it is slightly narrower than at the back. The labial side of the tooth is taller and less worn than the lingual side. There are two rows of cusps, and each lingual cusp is connected to each labial cusp by a broad crest, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> fossas in the middle. One of the two labial cusps may have been divided into two smaller cusps. The two crests are separated by a deep furrow. The enamel prisms of this tooth are small, like those of the premolar MACN Pv-RN 250.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are {{more likely to engage in}} this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E
