6000|$|After {{spanning}} the valley {{we began to}} ascend the lower slopes of a high range, whose folds formed like a curtain the bold background of the view. This is the landward face of the Ghauts, over which we were to pass before sighting the sea. Masses of cold grey cloud rolled from the table-formed summit, we were presently shrouded in mist, and as we advanced, rain began to fall. The light of day vanishing, we again descended into a Fiumara with a tortuous and rocky bed, the main drain of the landward mountain side. My companions, now half-starved,--they had lived through three days {{on a handful of}} dates and sweetmeats,--devoured with avidity the <b>wild</b> <b>Jujube</b> berries that strewed the stones. The guide had preceded us: when we came up with him, he was found seated upon a grassy bank {{on the edge of the}} rugged torrent bed. We sprang in pleased astonishment from the saddle, dire had been the anticipations that our mules,--one of them already required driving with the spear,--would, after another night of starvation, leave us to carry their loads upon our own hacks. The cause of the phenomenon soon revealed itself. In the rock was a hole about two feet wide, whence a crystal sheet welled over the Fiumara bank, forming a paradise for frog and tadpole. This [...] "Ga'angal" [...] is considered by the Somal a [...] "fairies' well:" [...] all, however, that the Donkey could inform me was, that when the Nomads settle in the valley, the water sinks deep below the earth--a knot which methinks might be unravelled without the interposition of a god. The same authority declared it to be the work of the [...] "old ancient" [...] Arabs.|$|E

40|$|Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) {{belongs to}} the Rhamnaceae family and is a popular fruit tree species with immense {{economic}} and nutritional value. Here, we report a draft genome of the dry jujube cultivar 'Junzao' and the genome resequencing of 31 geographically diverse accessions of cultivated and <b>wild</b> <b>jujubes</b> (Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa). Comparative analysis revealed that the genome of 'Dongzao', a fresh jujube, was ~ 86. 5 Mb larger {{than that of the}} 'Junzao', partially due to the recent insertions of transposable elements in the 'Dongzao' genome. We constructed eight proto-chromosomes of the common ancestor of Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae, two sister families in the order Rosales, and elucidated the evolutionary processes that have shaped the genome structures of modern jujubes. Population structure analysis revealed the complex genetic background of jujubes resulting from extensive hybridizations between <b>jujube</b> and its <b>wild</b> relatives. Notably, several key genes that control fruit organic acid metabolism and sugar content were identified in the selective sweep regions. We also identified S-locus genes controlling gametophytic self-incompatibility and investigated haplotype patterns of the S locus in the jujube genomes, which would provide a guideline for parent selection for jujube crossbreeding. This study provides valuable genomic resources for jujube improvement, and offers insights into jujube genome evolution and its population structure and domestication...|$|R

40|$|Ziziphus is an {{important}} genus within the family Rhamnaceae. This genus includes several important fruit tree species that are widely planted in China and India, such as the Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), the <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> (Z. acidojujuba), and the Indian jujube (Z. mauritiana). However, information about their domestication based on the chlorotype diversity of Chinese jujube population is lacking. In this study, chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) markers were developed and used to investigate the genetic relationships between and domestication of jujube cultivars and <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> populations. Primer sets flanking each of the 46 cpSSR loci in non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome sequence of Z. jujuba Mill. cv. 'Junzao' were designed. In total, 10 markers showed polymorphisms from 15 samples (9 jujube cultivars and 6 <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> individuals), of which 8 loci were due to variations {{in the number of}} mononucleotide (A/T) repeats and 2 were due to indels. Six cpSSR markers were used in further analyses of 81 additional samples (63 jujube cultivars, 17 <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> samples, and 1 Indian jujube). Using these cpSSR markers, the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to four. In general, the Shannon Index (I) for each cpSSR ranged from 0. 159 to 0. 1747, and the diversity indices (h) and uh were 0. 061 to 0. 435 and 0. 062 to 0. 439, respectively. Seven chlorotypes were found; the Indian jujube showed distinct chlorotypes, and both the Chinese and <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> had four chlorotypes and shared two chlorotypes. A dominant chlorotype (G) accounted for 53 of 72 jujube cultivars and 13 of 23 <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> individuals. All chlorotypes were highly localized along the Yellow River, from the mid- to the lower reaches, suggesting a wide origin of jujube. These cpSSR markers can be applied to population and evolution studies of Chinese jujube and <b>wild</b> <b>jujube...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>jujube</b> (Ziziphus acidojujuba Mill.) {{is highly}} {{tolerant}} to alkaline, saline and drought stress; however, no studies have performed transcriptome profiling {{to study the}} response of <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> to these and other abiotic stresses. In this study, we examined the tolerance of <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> to NaHCO 3 -NaOH solution and analyzed gene expression profiles in response to alkaline stress. Physiological experiments revealed that H 2 O 2 content in leaves increased significantly and root activity decreased quickly during alkaline of pH 9. 5 treatment. For transcriptome analysis, <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> plants grown hydroponically were treated with NaHCO 3 -NaOH solution for 0, 1, and 12 h and six transcriptomes from roots were built. In total, 32, 758 genes were generated, and 3, 604 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. After 1 h, 853 genes showed significantly different expression between control and treated plants; after 12 h, expression of 2, 856 genes was significantly different. The expression pattern of nine genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. After gene annotation and gene ontology enrichment analysis, the genes encoding transcriptional factors, serine/threonine-protein kinases, heat shock proteins, cysteine-like kinases, calmodulin-like proteins, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers {{were found to be}} closely involved in alkaline stress response. These results will provide useful insights for elucidating the mechanisms underlying alkaline tolerance in <b>wild</b> <b>jujube...</b>|$|E

The hypothesis that put into play the phenomenon of allelopathy as a mechanism of interference between the two species has been verified in this study. Thus, bioassays were conducted in vitro in the laboratory {{in order to test}} the effects of aqueous and hydro-ethanolic extracts of aerial and belowground parts of Barbary fig on seed germination and seedling growth of <b>wild</b> <b>jujube.</b> A dosage of total phenols by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and a subsequent identification of these phenols compounds have been made. The results showed that these phenols are present in both stems and roots of Barbary fig, with varying concentrations (6. 91 to 42. 75 mg EAG/g of dry weight) according organ of the plant and the solvent used in the extraction. Very significant inhibitory effects up to 100 % were observed on the kinetics and the final rate of jujube seed germination as well as its growth.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of drought stress induced by polyethylene glycol- 6000 in <b>wild</b> <b>jujube,</b> Ziziphus lotus. One-month-old, hydroponically grown seedlings were subjected to three treatments, i. e. normal watering (- 0. 2 MPa), moderate (- 1. 2 MPa) and severe (- 2. 1 MPa) drought stress for 14 days under controlled climatic conditions. Plant growth was markedly reduced with increasing osmotic stress. The shoot water potential (I-w) and leaf relative water content followed similar patterns and significantly decreased with increasing osmolality of solutions. As a consequence of drought, contents in proline and soluble sugars were found to be more elevated in leaves than in roots. The level of lipid peroxidation in terms of malonyldialdehyde contents increased in both leaves and roots of drought-stressed plants. <b>Wild</b> <b>jujube</b> displayed higher activities of antioxidant enzymes in the roots than in the leaves. Catalase and guaiacol peroxidase activities increased significantly in drought-stressed roots, whereas ascorbate peroxidase activity showed a slight decline with no significant changes. These findings suggest that Z. lotus was able to adapt to severe drought stress by accumulation of compatible solutes and by activation of free radical-scavenging enzymes. Overall, defence mechanisms in Z. lotus against oxidative stress are organized differently in plant tissues, with higher solute accumulation in leaves and increased activity of antioxidants in roots, during drought stress...|$|E

The wastewater, which contains jujube meat, brings great pollution to the environment. To solve this problem, the existing jujube core extraction technology is analyses firstly. Then a new project of jujube take core machine is proposed in this paper. This new project can separate the jujube core and the jujube meat in the same machine. The detailed structure calculation and kinematics analysis of the new machine key components, such as the broken device and the separate device, were done on the computer. Finally, according to the design result, using the software Pro/ENGINEER, the prototype machine was designed and manufactured, then test lots of times. The experiment proved that the machine can effectively reduce water consumption and the volume of sewage to achieve the purpose of environment protection. ...|$|E
40|$|Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is {{the most}} {{economically}} important member of the Rhamnaceae family and contains {{a high concentration of}} ascorbic acid (AsA). To explore the metabolic mechanism of AsA accumulation, we investigated the abundance of AsA in the fruit development stages, the leaf and flower of Z. jujuba cv Junzao, and the mature fruit of one type of <b>wild</b> <b>jujube</b> (Z. jujuba var. spinosa Hu, Yanchuan sour jujube). And the expression patterns of genes involved in AsA biosynthesis, degradation and recycling were analyzed. The result showed that AsA biosynthesis during early fruit development (the enlargement stage) is the main reason for jujube high accumulation. The L-galactose pathway plays a predominant role in the biosynthesis of AsA during jujube fruit development, and the genes GMP 1, GME 1, GGP, and GaLDH involved in the determination of AsA concentration during fruit development and in different genotypes; the myo-inositol pathway along with the genes GME 2 and GMP 2 in the L-galactose pathway play a compensatory role in maintaining AsA accumulation during the ripening stage. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism in regulating AsA accumulation for jujube...|$|E
