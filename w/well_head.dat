5|$|The Gilwell Farmhouse is {{believed}} to date from the early 18th century, making it the oldest original building at Gilwell Park. It is composed of two buildings that were joined together. There is a brick <b>well</b> <b>head</b> on the farm that {{is known as the}} Gil Well. A field adjoining the boundaries of Gilwell Park, known as Bill Oddie Field, affords dramatic views of the London skyline over Pole Hill, Chingford. The field was so-named after employees of The Scout Association spotted TV ornithologist Bill Oddie recording a programme about circling birds of prey on the field in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Often mid-stream and <b>well</b> <b>head</b> gases require {{removal of}} many of the various {{hydrocarbon}} species contained within the natural gas. Some of these gases include heptane, pentane, propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above Methane (CH4) to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission. Typically, natural gas compressors require 950 to 1050BTU per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational name plate specifications.|$|E
25|$|Natural-gas {{processing}} {{begins at}} the <b>well</b> <b>head.</b> The composition of the raw natural gas extracted from producing wells depends on the type, depth, and location of the underground deposit and the geology of the area. Oil and natural gas are often found {{together in the same}} reservoir. The natural gas produced from oil wells is generally classified as associated-dissolved, meaning that the natural gas is associated with or dissolved in crude oil. Natural gas production absent any association with crude oil is classified as “non-associated.” In 2009, 89 percent of U.S. wellhead production of natural gas was non-associated.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{gas flowing}} in the {{distribution}} lines and at the natural gas <b>well</b> <b>head</b> are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a British thermal unit (BTU) value between 950 and 1050BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.|$|E

2500|$|Ricketts traditions include fire related {{activities}} and the brakedrum. [...] Prior to early 2003, the Ricketts courtyard housed a large concrete firepot, in which massive fires were often enjoyed during cool Pasadena evenings. [...] The courtyard originally featured a large Italian marble <b>well</b> <b>head</b> (historically attributed to and named [...] "Millikan's Pot"). It {{was used as a}} measure for height of serves in the singles and doubles games of four square played in the courtyard. [...] By the mid 70's, it existed only as chunks of rubble, after destruction in an experiment in more exciting pot fires allegedly involving newspaper, xylene, and matches. [...] Around that time, enterprising house officers arranged for its replacement with a large section of concrete sewer pipe, which was eventually replaced with a concrete facsimile of the original pot. [...] Due to tightening of Pasadena fire codes and the Caltech administration's recent focus on liability concerns, the firepot was removed. [...] A portable fireplace temporarily replaced the firepot. [...] The brakedrum is a contest between the freshman class and the sophomore class over ownership of the brakedrum.|$|E

6000|$|The young author {{generally}} writes {{because he}} wants to write, either for money, from vanity, or in mere weariness of empty hours and anxiety to astonish his relations. This is well, he who would fail cannot begin better than by having nothing to say. The less you observe, the less you reflect, the less you put yourself in the paths of adventure and experience, the less you will have to say, and the more impossible will it be to read your work. Never notice people's manner, conduct, nor even dress, in real life. Walk through the world with your eyes and ears closed, and embody the negative results in a story or a poem. As to Poetry, with a fine instinct we generally begin by writing verse, because verse is the last thing that the public want to read. The young writer has usually read a great deal of verse, however, and most of it bad. His favourite authors are the bright lyrists who sing of broken hearts, wasted lives, early deaths, disappointment, gloom. Without having even had an unlucky flirtation, or without knowing what it is to lose a favourite cat, the early author pours forth laments, just like the laments he has been reading. He has too a favourite manner, the old consumptive manner, about the hectic flush, the fatal rose on the pallid cheek, about the ruined roof tree, the empty chair, the rest in the village churchyard.
