40|$|From {{the humble}} three-legged milking stool to a SEMI {{standard}} <b>wafer</b> <b>pod</b> location to numerous sub-micron fixturing applications in instruments and machines, exactly constrained mechanisms provide precision, robustness, and certainty of location and design. Kinematic couplings exactly constrain {{six degrees of}} freedom between two parts and hence closed-form equations can be written to describe the structural performance of the coupling. Hertz contact theory {{can also be used to}} design the contact interface so very high stiffness and load capacity can also be achieved. Potential applications such as mechanical/electrical couplings for batteries could enable electric vehicles to rapidly exchange battery packs...|$|E
40|$|To achieve higher {{utilization}} of production floor, reduce traffic congestion, and improve travel time efficiency and layout flexibility, {{material handling system}} is extended to move loads through every spatial paths to perform factory-wide handling tasks. We designate this material flow structure the Orthogonal Spatial Material Flow (OSMF) structure. Instead of planar (2 -D) moves, OSMF structure outlines a three-dimensional material flow network with feasible orthogonal paths between the spatial points which may be spread over factory floor, ceiling, overhead, underground, or multifloor spaces. The OSMF paths can possess multiple flow layers that are laid in the space virtually or physically, vertically or horizontally, disjointedly or connectedly. ^ The OSMF problem is studied {{within the context of}} automated wafer handling systems in semiconductor fabs. As all the goals are set on 300 mm. or larger wafer manufacturing for the 21 st century, fab automation becomes the current trend in semiconductor fabrication facilities due to the heavy <b>wafer</b> <b>pod</b> (16 – 20 lbs) and the large flow times distances (360 miles per day). ^ In this dissertation, a two-layer single-floor OSMF structure is adapted to existing fab layouts. Our approach to the OSMF problem confronts the issues of flow path design and transport service level. We focus on the following developments: (1) overhead interbay track layout design by constructing circular layout for multi-carrier heavy traffic system in interbay zones, (2) overhead intrabay track layout design by developing optimal single and double spine layouts, and (3) mixed model fleet sizing capacity model by M/G/ 1 queue with server vacations. ^ To our knowledge, this is the first study of OSMF analysis of material handling systems. The study aims at the development of a generic design framework for OSMF systems and to assist planar material flow systems to expand to OSMF analysis. We demonstrate the static analysis procedures by generating a two-layer mixed model system for semiconductor fabs. The procedures introduced are efficient, requiring only minor computation time, and are applicable to many real-world scenarios. The problem is significant in that, with an OSMF system all the movement activities in the shop floor can be done with less space, cost, and time. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Chloride ions (Cl−) in the {{cleanroom}} environment induce metal corrosion {{of integrated}} circuits, and cause wafer scrap events. In this paper, pattern wafers {{were designed to}} monitor critical Cl − concentration which leads to metal cor-rosion effects in a simulated airborne molecular contamina-tion (AMC) environment. The simulated Cl − contamination environment was established by placing different numbers of preventive maintenance (PM) wipers in <b>wafer</b> <b>pods</b> and mon-itored simultaneously by ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) and impinger+ion chromatography (IC) instruments. The exposed Al– Cu pattern wafers were analyzed by the KLA surface scanner and the scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyzer. The {{results indicate that the}} IMS and the impinger+IC instruments provide consistent HCl monitoring data. Furthermore, they suggest that pattern wafer exposure tests can be an effective method to monitor metal corrosion. The PM wipers are a simple and effective method to establish simulated source of HCl for studying the AMC effect in ppbv levels. The critical HCl concentration where particles could be found on the wafer surface is around 2. 0 – 3. 5 ppbv, and the critical HCl concentration that results in metal corrosion defects is around 4. 1 – 6. 4 ppbv.

40|$|A {{compact filter}} fan unit (FFU) was {{developed}} and used as the clean air supply for a cleanroom tunnel. The tunnel connects cleanroom areas which are separated by a grey area of low cleanliness. The tunnel will be used by a monorail transport system when it transports <b>wafers</b> in SMIF <b>pods</b> between the cleanrooms. A cleanliness of class 1 according to Federal Standard 209 E was achieved in the tunnel. More than 20 data carrier systems were studied {{in order to find}} out if they can be used as automated lot identification systems. Four typical candidates were selected and evaluated in detail. For each of them a demonstration system was built. All systems worked satisfactorily and could be integrated into SMIF interfaces. But only two are really suitable for use in IC manufacturing lines. The total costs of the system are dominated by the costs caused by software integration. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{with the}} {{increasing}} of the wafer's size and the decreasing of critical size of integrated circuit manufacturing in modern high-tech, microelectronics industry needs a maximum attention to challenge the contamination control. The move to 300 [mm] is accompanied {{by the use of}} Front Opening Unified <b>Pods</b> for <b>wafer</b> and his storage. In these pods an airborne cross contamination may occur between <b>wafers</b> and the <b>pods.</b> A predictive approach using modeling and computational methods is very powerful method to understand and qualify the AMCs cross contamination processes. This work investigates the required numerical tools which are employed in order to study the AMCs cross-contamination transfer phenomena between wafers and FOUPs. Numerical optimization and finite element formulation in transient analysis were established. Analytical solution of one dimensional problem was developed and the calibration process of physical constants was performed. The least square distance between the model (analytical 1 D solution) and the experimental data are minimized. The behavior of the AMCs intransient analysis was determined. The model framework preserves the classical forms of the diffusion and convection-diffusion equations and yields to consistent form of the Fick's law. The adsorption process and the surface roughness effect were also traduced as a boundary condition using the switch condition Dirichlet to Neumann and the interface condition. The methodology is applied, first using the optimization methods with analytical solution to define physical constants, and second using finite element method including adsorption kinetic and the switch of Dirichlet to Neumann condition...|$|R
