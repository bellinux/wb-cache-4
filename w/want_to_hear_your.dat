2500|$|Gaston is {{admitted}} and expresses {{his desire to}} be close to Héléne again. [...] He begins to plan his escape (Aria: Je veux encore entendre.. / [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> voice again") when the Emir arrives and advises him that escape will result in his death. [...] At that moment, Hélène, having been captured in the city, is brought in. The couple pretends not to know one another, but the Emir is suspicious. [...] However, they are left alone and are joyous in their reunion, until Gaston attempts to dissuade Hélène from associating with him in his dishonor (Aria: Dans la honte et l'épouvante / [...] "You cannot share in the horror and shame of my wandering life!"). She remains firmly resolved to remain with him. [...] From a window, they see the approaching Crusaders and, in the chaos, determine to escape but are thwarted by the arrival of the Emir's soldiers.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} know when morning comes," [...] said he sorrowfully. [...] "And besides I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> voices all the time; for, when nobody is speaking, {{it seems as}} if I were alone in a dark world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet. He evidently {{thinks the}} thing impossible--besides, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> {{opinion on the}} matter before sayin' {{anything}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Brisbane was visibly annoyed. [...] "I didn't {{suppose you}} would come on till eleven; that's the word I got over the 'phone. I {{particularly}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> deposition," [...] he added, sourly.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] said Soames, {{moistening}} his lips: [...] "there's {{no need to}} say more. I'm instructing Linkman and Laver of Budge Row to act for me. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> evidence, but kindly {{make your}} report to them at five o'clock, and continue to observe the utmost secrecy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Everybody {{looked at}} Henchard. His face seemed strange, and in tint {{as if it}} had been {{powdered}} over with ashes. [...] "We don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> life and adventures," [...] said the second magistrate sharply, filling the pause which followed. [...] "You've been asked if you've anything to say bearing on the case." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{were soon}} {{gathered}} in the cockpit. [...] "I have not much time to stay," [...] Wilkinson said, [...] "and, before I tell you my story, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> news, for beyond a few rumours current at Smyrna and Rhodes, we really know hardly anything of what has taken place since we left you at Acre." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Torchlight" [...] {{is a song}} by Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, {{written for}} the {{upcoming}} Australian film Don't Tell, a true story about a young girl seeking justice against the church. In the ballad, Higgins sings of the issues explored in the film: [...] "Sometimes evil is a quiet town where nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> truth/ and nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> believe you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{and your}} folks feel that way about it, I'd like very much to meet the old man again and {{have a talk with}} him. Of course, {{he told me that he}} never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> father's name mentioned; but if I got a good chance I might be able to get him to open up and tell me his side of the story. And after he had done that, he might be more willing to listen to what I had to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me!" [...] said old Jolyon; [...] "I don't {{know what}} you mean. You come {{worrying}} me about a thing like this. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about <b>your</b> affairs; you must manage them yourself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D---- the ----!" [...] Lord Augustus in his assumed wrath {{was about}} to be very severe on his daughter, but he checked himself again. [...] "I'm not going to stop here talking all day," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> {{explanation}} and then I shall know how to act." [...] Up to this time he had been standing, which was unusual with him. Now he flung himself into an armchair.|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] she said, [...] "let {{that be the}} {{beginning}} and end of ceremony. This is not a court gathering, but a family meeting. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> stories, and I want you, for the time, to forget that I am Anne of England. I know that your fathers have always been faithful to our house, and I hope that their sons will, ere long, do as good service for me as they have done for a foreign prince.|$|E
6000|$|... "All of us, my honest friend," [...] {{continued}} the Doctor, [...] "are subject to making mistakes; {{so that the}} chief art of life, is to learn how best to remedy mistakes. Now one remedy for mistakes is honesty. So pay the man for {{the damage done to}} his box. And now, who are you, my friend? My correspondents here mention your name--Israel Potter--and say you are an American, an escaped prisoner of war, but nothing further. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> story from your own lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the curious}} part of it," [...] she said. [...] "It doesn't seem strange at all. It {{seems as if}} I had been <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> voice--as if I had known of you all my life----" [...] She tried to {{suppress}} her coughing, {{and he was in}} agony during the paroxysm. The nurse came hurrying out, and while he waited at one side Clement felt that if he could have taken her by the hands he could have prevented it. It was a singular conviction, but it was most definite, and had a peculiar air of actuality.|$|R
6000|$|Clavering made {{a little}} gesture, and the {{deference}} in {{it was at least}} half sincere. [...] "You command it, and I must try to make amends. Now, don't you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about <b>your</b> father and the Range?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I see. And your {{business}} {{has to do}} with rough places," [...] said Miss Sampson. [...] "Strange that papa would not see you. Stranger that he should <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> business. Either he's joking or <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> impress me.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a long}} story, dear, and I {{will tell}} you all presently; and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> story too. Ah! here come the others. It is to them, Mysa, far more than {{to me that you}} owe your rescue. I may know more of the {{learning}} of our people, but I have none of the readiness and coolness of Amuba, while Jethro is as prudent as he is brave. It would have fared hardly with me as well as with you, Mysa, {{had it not been for}} these good friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{would advise}} you to beg, borrow or steal the money. A man of your {{abilities}} and practical experience oughtn't to find much difficulty {{in this part of}} the world," [...] said the newcomer. [...] "The tale may have been a fabrication, but it sounded true, and while I don't set up as a reformer I am a director of this Company, and can't have those rumors set going about its secretary. No, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> side of the case--it's probably highly creditable to you--but I know all about the kind of business you were running, and a good many other folks in this province do, too." ...|$|E

He looks aged and thin, Ethel, {{and yet that}} sweet {{expression}} {{is the same as}} ever. Is he very anxious about poor Margaret?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{all about}} <b>your</b> adventures {{in the far}} north," [...] added Ben. [...] "How you {{discovered}} the North Pole, and shot bears and wolves----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all <b>your</b> adventures. We {{have not}} had much fighting. Niort made but a poor resistance, and Parthenay {{surrendered}} without striking a blow; then I went with the party that occupied Fontenay. The Catholics fought stoutly there, but we were too strong for them. Those three places have given La Rochelle three bulwarks to the north.|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the release}} of The Positiva Ambient Collection and under the {{inspiration}} of its success, Positiva Records would establish the Phase series of compilations in 1994 that featured exclusive mixes from the label, beginning with Positiva: Phase One (1994). Several of the artists who signed to Positiva between {{the release of}} Ambient Collection and Positiva: Phase One did so in reply to the message in the liner notes of The Positiva Ambient Collection, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> tapes!", complete with contact information.|$|E
5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} François Couture states, [...] "one {{is struck by}} the {{multifaceted}} balance of the album as a whole... Braxton pays a loving tribute to each tune, respecting the melody, pushing it beyond the composer's wildest dreams, taking it apart and reassembling it in the most natural-sounding way. ...These are masterfully creative revisitations of chunks of jazz history, big and small". All About Jazz reviewer Christinan Carey noted [...] "Much of the repertoire featured here was integral to the cool jazz of the fifties, but the quartet tears into {{it like it was}} written yesterday. ...If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> favorite old standards sounding brand new again, this set fits the bill".|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> any of <b>your</b> beastly plans. Plans are no good. She's {{gone and}} {{fallen in love}} with this other bloke, and now hates my gizzard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more of <b>your</b> {{adventures in}} the Forest of Gugu, {{and how you}} were able to get those dear little monkeys to use in Dorothy's Surprise Cake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not fatigued," [...] said Mr. Wells, {{to his old}} friend. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{all about}} <b>your</b> work, what you have done, and what you hope to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|The next theme {{night was}} Elton John and Jenny chose to sing [...] "Rocket Man." [...] Her {{performance}} earned her a mediocre {{response from the}} judges with comments that included [...] "With the song selection and the arrangement and how level your performance was {{it was sort of}} like the words you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> surgeon say... whoops," [...] from Zach Werner and [...] "I think you took a song that's extremely hard to sing and you did a damn fine job," [...] from Sass Jordan. The next night, she had her first and last trip to the bottom two along with eventual Canadian Idol winner Ryan Malcolm. When the results were announced the crowd was shocked to find Jenny eliminated.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{numerous}} complaints, Diddy arranged {{a meeting with}} the band at Circle House Recording Studios. Getting over her initial nerves, O'Day relayed the same message to Diddy as she had to Dimanche. D. Woods helped convey this message, adding that they wanted to [...] "understand his vision" [...] and that they [...] "had a different idea" [...] and thought [...] "he did too", going in a more uptempo direction. Diddy defended his stances on the issue, stating, [...] "If I feel something, then I at least <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> texture on it. That's the play that I'm calling. Go run the play!" [...] O'Day countered, continuing that the process of making the album was [...] "personal" [...] and that he would best understand this, him being a recording artist in his own right. She followed that the group understood that they would not love everything that they ever did {{and it would be a}} [...] "compromise", but none of them have finished a track, wanting to perform it forever as part of their career.|$|E
6000|$|... "Robert <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> some of <b>your</b> stories, Uncle Jesse," [...] I said. [...] "Tell him the {{one about}} the captain who went crazy and {{imagined}} he was the Flying Dutchman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} have never changed, Jack, never thought of Nelly but as a true friend. I {{did not know whether}} now you might think differently. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>your</b> own lips. Now I know you don't, that you have no thought of ever being more than a true friend to her, I shall try if I cannot win her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Ford <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> some of <b>your</b> stories, Captain Jim" [...] said Anne. [...] "Tell him the {{one about}} the captain who went crazy and {{imagined}} he was the Flying Dutchman." ...|$|R
