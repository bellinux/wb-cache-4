5|$|The <b>Wheeler</b> family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, <b>Wheeler</b> invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit <b>Wheeler</b> Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but <b>Wheeler</b> declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. <b>Wheeler</b> was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate by next appointing <b>Wheeler</b> Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus <b>Wheeler</b> Peckham, the brother of <b>Wheeler</b> Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E

5|$|From there, <b>Wheeler</b> {{was invited}} to direct a Society of Antiquaries {{excavation}} at the Roman settlement of Verulamium, which existed on land recently acquired by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, before leaving a fifth season of excavation {{under the control of}} the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon and the architect A. W. G. Lowther. <b>Wheeler</b> enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site, and also liked its proximity to his home in London. He was particularly interested in searching for a pre-Roman Iron Age oppidum at the site, noting that the existence of a nearby Catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence. With <b>Wheeler</b> focusing his attention on potential Iron Age evidence, Tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls; <b>Wheeler</b> had affairs with at least three assistants during the project. After Tessa wrote two interim reports, the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities, jointly written by <b>Wheeler</b> and his wife. The report resulted in the first major published criticism of <b>Wheeler,</b> produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for Antiquity; although stating that there was much to praise about the work, he critiqued Wheeler's selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork. <b>Wheeler</b> responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both Myres and Myres's employer, Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E

[...] The strength of the <b>wheelers</b> is often the limiting factor in determining the maximum safe load for a vehicle [...] while all the animals can pull uphill, only the <b>wheelers</b> can hold the vehicle downhill.

5|$|In Paducah, Barkley {{worked as}} a law clerk for Charles K. <b>Wheeler,</b> an {{attorney}} and congressman for the district, accepting access to Wheeler's law library as payment for his services. Despite their political differences – <b>Wheeler</b> supported William Jennings Bryan and Free Silver, while Barkley identified with the Gold Democrats – he hoped that being acquainted with and taught by <b>Wheeler</b> would aid him in his future endeavors, but congressional duties frequently kept <b>Wheeler</b> away from the office. After two months, Barkley accepted an offer to clerk for Judge William Sutton Bishop and former congressman John Kerr Hendrick, who paid him $15 per month. He read law while completing his duties and {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1901. Barkley practiced in Paducah where a friend of Hendrick's appointed him reporter of the circuit court. He continued studying law in the summer of 1902 at the University of Virginia School of Law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, <b>Wheeler</b> and three of his {{batteries}} were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, <b>Wheeler</b> visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where <b>Wheeler</b> and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, <b>Wheeler</b> took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand {{what it was like for}} aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.|$|E

5|$|To {{instruct}} new Pakistani {{students in}} the methods of archaeology, in early 1950 <b>Wheeler</b> ran a training excavation at Mohenjo-daro; there, he was joined by the British student Leslie Alcock, who spoke both Punjabi and Urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by <b>Wheeler.</b> This excavation {{proved to be the}} only one for which <b>Wheeler</b> would not write and publish a full excavation report. Instead, he made reference to its findings in his book The Indus Civilization, published as part of the series The Cambridge History of India. His relationship with the Pakistani government had become strained, and so he declined to return to work for them for a third year.|$|E
5|$|Turning his {{attention}} to southern India, <b>Wheeler</b> discovered remnants of a Roman amphora in a museum, and began excavations at Arikamedu, revealing a port from the first century CE which had traded in goods from the Roman Empire. The excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat, although {{it was during the}} excavation that World War II ended; in celebration, <b>Wheeler</b> gave all his workers an extra rupee for the day. It has since been alleged that while <b>Wheeler</b> took credit for discovering the significance of this site, it had previously been established by A. Aiyappan, the Superintendent of the Government Museum in Madras, and the French archaeologist Jouveau Dubreuil, with <b>Wheeler</b> intentionally ignoring their contribution. He later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in Brahmagiri, Mysore, which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern India.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of the Keeper of the London Museum, Harmon Oates, <b>Wheeler</b> was invited to fill the vacancy.

In Wales, many felt that <b>Wheeler</b> had simply taken the directorship of the National Museum to advance his own career prospects, and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along. <b>Wheeler</b> himself disagreed, believing that he had left Fox at the Museum as his obvious successor, and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue. The position initially provided <b>Wheeler</b> with an annual salary of £600, which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family, who moved into a flat near to Victoria Station.|$|E

The Indian government had deemed <b>Wheeler</b> ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. <b>Wheeler</b> enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.|$|E
