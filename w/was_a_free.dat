5|$|After the 1913 season, Evers {{was offered}} $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) {{to jump to}} the Federal League, but he opted to take less money to remain with the Cubs. In February 1914, after Evers signed his players to contracts, Murphy fired Evers as manager and traded him to the Boston Braves for Bill Sweeney and Hub Perdue. Murphy insisted that Evers had {{resigned}} as manager, which Evers denied. Evers insisted he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> agent, but the league assigned him to the Braves. He signed a four-year contract at $10,000 per season ($ in current dollar terms), with a $20,000 signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2002 season, Thome, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> agent, rejected the Indians' offer, to instead sign a six-year, $85 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies – he thought the Phillies were closer to winning a championship than the Indians. With the Phillies, Thome's salary rose from $8 million per year to $11 million per year. Thome hit a franchise record 334 home runs in his first stint with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1844, Willamette University's {{library was}} started {{two years after}} the {{establishment}} of the school. The library grew to a size of 2,500 volumes in 1874. University Hall (now Waller Hall), which was built in 1867, was one of the homes of the library in the early years. The library was located {{on the third floor of}} the building. The early name for the institution was the Willamette University Library, which by 1901 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free,</b> general library with both circulating and reference collections. That year the library collection had grown to 4,686 volumes, along with a total of 2,753 pamphlets.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August 2010, Kaladze {{signed with}} Genoa; Milan later {{revealed}} that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> transfer. In the 2010–11 season, he played 26 matches and scored one goal, which came against Parma on 30 January 2011. He was named as second-best {{defender of the}} 2010–11 Serie A by La Gazzetta dello Sport, being surpassed only by his former teammate, Milan's Thiago Silva. On 12 May 2012, Kaladze announced his retirement from football.|$|E
5|$|On November 26, 1861, Governor Johnson {{issued an}} address to the {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth blaming abolitionists for the breakup of the United States. He asserted his belief that the Union and Confederacy were forces of equal strength, and that the only solution to the war <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> trade agreement between the two sovereign nations. He further announced his willingness to resign as provisional governor if the Kentucky General Assembly would agree to cooperate with Governor Magoffin. Magoffin himself denounced the Russellville Convention and the provisional government, stressing the need to abide by the will {{of the majority of the}} Commonwealth's citizens.|$|E
5|$|Oregon State University was {{established}} in 1868. The Oregon Legislative Assembly appropriated $1,000 to the school to buy books for a library in 1876, marking the first instance of the legislature giving funds to the school for a library. In 1887, the library {{was established}} at the school, and in 1890, May Warren was hired as the first full-time librarian. By 1893 the library's collection had grown to 1,950 volumes. After adding 2,600 volumes from 1899 to 1900, the collection stood at 5,000 volumes. At that time the library <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free,</b> general library with both circulating and reference collections with A. J. Stimpson serving as the librarian. The library also had 6,000 pamphlets {{at that time and}} the annual circulation was 8,000.|$|E

5|$|Phrynion learnt that Neaira {{was back}} in Athens, and {{attempted}} to take her back from Stephanus. Stephanus resisted, claiming that as Neaira <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> woman he had no right; a claim which Phrynion proceeded to challenge in court, though he was persuaded to settle the case by arbitration instead. The arbitrators decided that Neaira was indeed free, and {{that in addition to}} this she was her own kyria (mistress); this was an extremely unusual decision in a society where all citizen women, at least, had a kyrios (master). Despite this unusual level of freedom, however, Neaira was compelled to split her time between the two men as they agreed, without any input herself.|$|E
5|$|The Calgary Flames {{declined}} {{an opportunity}} to sign Raymond when he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> agent in 2013, but the departure of Michael Cammalleri in 2014 left the team {{in need of a}} veteran forward. Calgary signed Raymond to a three-year contract worth $9.5 million. In the second game of the 2014–15 season, Raymond scored the 100th goal of his NHL career as part of this third career hat trick to lead the Flames to a 5–2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E
5|$|The Oilers re-signed Brewer, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> agent, to a one-year, $907,500 {{contract}} in August 2001. In {{his second season}} with the Oilers, Brewer was assigned to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players by Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish. Brewer began to play more minutes in games, typically placing among the NHL leaders in average minutes played per game. With this enhanced role on the team, Brewer finished his season with new career highs in assists and points {{for the second consecutive}} season, and matched his career high in goals. Although his single year contract expired, his role on the Oilers had become more important and Brewer expected a large raise for his third season with the Oilers.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the river}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> river, {{there are no}} figures for traffic on the lower river. However, it {{connected}} {{to a number of}} waterways on which tolls were collected, and so an indication of the traffic can be gained from the figures for these waterways. The main cargoes on Beverley Beck in 1730 were coal, bricks, turfs and wool, together with cereal crops, consisting of wheat, barley, oats and malt. Receipts from tolls more than doubled between 1732 and 1748, after which the tolls were let to an independent collector. The annual rent charged for this privilege doubled again between 1748 and 1792. There was a steady expansion of trade on the Driffield Navigation during the same period, as the dividends paid to shareholders rose from 1.5 to 4 per cent. In 1789, Bainton, Boyes and Co negotiated a lump sum payment to cover coal from the Aire and Calder Navigation to their new carpet factory and the export of their carpets in the downstream direction. The factory later became a corn mill.|$|E
5|$|Del Piero <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> {{kick and}} penalty kick (62 goals from {{penalties}}) specialist. He {{is the third}} highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 times out of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. Del Piero's unique free kick technique was usually characterised by a curling strike which rose high over the wall, and then suddenly dropped into the top corner of the goal; he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training during their time together at Juventus, and was also influenced by the free kick technique {{of one of his}} idols, Platini. Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick technique was compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having it touched by a teammate first. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus, and for his fair play and correct behaviour on the pitch.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Ball was loosely {{modeled on}} the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Torishima said he chose it largely because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> {{intellectual}} property, but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga {{at the time and}} would make it both unique and differentiate it from Dr. Slumps West Coast of the United States feel. While the characters in Journey to the West travel to collect sacred scrolls, Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game-like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its shōnen magazine audience. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought the story would last about a year, or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at an older audience.|$|E

5|$|Following Pirlo's {{departure}} from Milan in 2011, Juventus signed {{him on a}} free transfer on a contract until 2014. His debut with Juventus was in a friendly match against Sporting Clube de Portugal, which they lost 2–1. His first competitive match with Juventus was the Serie A opening match against Parma at home, in which tallied two assists, for Stephan Lichtsteiner and Claudio Marchisio, and completed 110 passes in a 4–1 victory. Antonio Conte played him alongside younger midfielders Marchisio and new signing Arturo Vidal in a three-man midfield, which allowed Pirlo to function creatively as a deep-lying playmaker, while Marchisio and Vidal supported him defensively. Pirlo's first goal for Juventus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> kick against Catania on 18 February 2012 securing a 3–1 victory for Juventus and put the club back {{at the top of}} the Serie A table, above his former side Milan. On 18 March, Pirlo scored in a 5–0 demolition of Fiorentina and after the game dedicated the win to Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a cardiac arrest playing for Bolton Wanderers during a match against Tottenham Hotspur the same day.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2011, Young {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the New York Mets worth $1.1 million with the ability to reach up to $4.5 million through incentives. In his first career start with the Mets on April 5, 2011, Young went five and a third innings while striking out seven batters, recording the victory in a 7–1 Mets win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also went three for three at the plate with two runs batted in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels. In that game, Young became the first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning. Shortly after the start of the season, Young sustained an arm injury which forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list. Following the season, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of its {{existence}} became public when Square Enix trademarked the name in May 2013. The game was first announced in the second September issue of Famitsu Weekly, and was demoed during TGS 2013. Originally scheduled for release {{in the winter of}} 2013, it was delayed due to development problems concerning environment sizes, which needed to be scaled down. It was rescheduled for the first quarter of 2014, then was pushed forward to spring of that year. Street clothes for the characters were offered as a pre-registration bonus, while a code to download outfits inspired by Kurasame, a supporting character from Type-0, were included in the final volume of the spin-off manga Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade. Pre-registration closed on May 7, 2013. Chapter delivery began the day after the game's official release on May 14, 2014. The base game <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> download, but players had the option of buying items, restore health and speeding up re-spawn time via microtransactions. The original version also reset individual character experience levels {{at the end of a}} playthrough, while an update in 2015 allowed players to carry over experience levels between playthroughs.|$|E
