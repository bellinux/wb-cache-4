5|$|In 1977, the Eon Productions film The Spy <b>Who</b> <b>Loved</b> Me was {{released}} and, {{due to the}} radical differences between the film and the original novel of the same name, Eon productions authorised a novelization, James Bond, The Spy <b>Who</b> <b>Loved</b> Me.

5|$|When Ian Fleming {{sold the}} film {{rights to the}} James Bond novels to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, he gave {{permission}} only for the title The Spy <b>Who</b> <b>Loved</b> Me to be used. Since the screenplay for the film {{had nothing to do}} with Fleming's original novel, Eon Productions, for the first time, authorised a novelisation based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since Colonel Sun nearly a decade earlier. Christopher Wood, who co-authored the screenplay, was commissioned to write the book titled James Bond, The Spy <b>Who</b> <b>Loved</b> Me.|$|E

5|$|Following The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun, {{producer}} Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, {{brought about by}} financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor, {{in which he had}} invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy <b>Who</b> <b>Loved</b> Me.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{occasionally}} supplements his {{alcohol consumption}} {{with the use}} of other drugs, for both functional and recreational reasons: Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine benzedrine accompanied by champagne, before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax (also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini); he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions, such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die, or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy <b>Who</b> <b>Loved</b> Me.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{then decided}} to start {{production}} on The Man with the Golden Gun after Live and Let Die.
