500|$|Darwaza {{was born}} to a middle-class Sunni Muslim mercantile family in Nablus. The Darwaza family had long been {{involved}} in textiles and had extensive trade relationships with merchants in Beirut and Damascus. In his memoirs, Izzat writes [...] "The import of [...] goods from the outside was, for the most part, through Beirut and Damascus." [...] Izzat's father, 'Abd al-Hadi Darwaza and his paternal grandfather Darwish Darwaza, owned a store in the Khan al-Tujjar of Nablus. [...] Izzat recalled, [...] "From <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> from my father and through my grandfather, the title merchant or merchants in Nablus mostly referred to owners of commercial textile and cloth shops. In Nablus, these shops were confined, or mostly confined, to a caravansary called Khan al-Tujjar, {{in the middle of}} Nablus." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nightfly is more unapologetically jazzy than Fagen's {{previous}} work with Steely Dan, and his lyrics are more wistful and nostalgic than biting. Fagen aimed for his lyrics to have [...] "as little irony as possible," [...] and {{his goal was}} to make an album that was fun to listen to. As many of the songs come from an adolescent viewpoint, he hoped for them to maintain [...] "a certain innocence." [...] Walter Becker was responsible for the more sardonic elements in Steely Dan, and many writers have considered his absence the reason for the album's [...] "warm and nostalgic" [...] tone. Another difference between The Nightfly and his work with Becker is that it maintains a focus on a [...] "certain period [...] motif," [...] according to Fagen. Though Fagen hints in the album's liner notes that it is an autobiographical piece, he downplayed this notion in a later interview: [...] "It is not me exactly. It is a composite character of myself, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> and people I knew. Plus, it includes my feelings in retrospect." ...|$|E

2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E
