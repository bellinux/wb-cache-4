5|$|All {{properties}} {{which had}} been confiscated by Domitian were returned to their respective families. Nerva also sought to involve the Senate in his government, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> successful. He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted, and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro-Domitianic faction of the Senate, he incurred hostility {{which may have been}} the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life.|$|E
5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drain Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand Sluice. The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot Drain. The scheme <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> {{bad news}} for Vienna. At Haslach, Johann von Klenau arranged his 25,000infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, the overly confident General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Étang attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000men. The French lost 1,500men killed and wounded. Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and guidons of the 15th and 17th Dragoons, Klenau's force also captured 900men, 11guns and 18 ammunition wagons.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have {{generally}} fallen during Santesson's period at the helm, though this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> his faultthere were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers. Santesson himself, despite a modicum of controversy over his heavy use of UFO and related material, was kind and helpful to writers, and was well liked as a result.|$|E

5|$|There {{was some}} dispute on the {{question}} over who was Subh-i-Azal's appointed successor. MacEoin states that Subh-i-Azal appointed Yahya Dawlatábádí as his successor in turn {{after the death of}} his (Yahya's) father, Mirza Hadi Dawlatábádí. However, this was disputed by Subh-i-Azal's grandson, Jalal Azal, indicating that this question <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> resolved.|$|E
5|$|While Klein's use of {{aluminium}} for a bicycle frames <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> novel, {{his use of}} large diameter tubes was. Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes {{he was able to}} make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.|$|E
5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Pacts of May, {{which ended}} the near-war {{tensions}} between Argentina and Chile, Argentina sold its two armored cruisers, Rivadavia and Moreno, that were under construction in Italy to Japan. Constitución and Libertad were put up for sale in early 1903. While the United Kingdom <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> interested in the ships, international politics took precedence: when the Russian Empire made an offer for the ships, the British grew concerned that the Swiftsure class could be used against their new ally Japan. To prevent this, the British purchased both Chilean battleships on 3 December 1903 for £2,432,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a victory}} over the Buffalo Sabres after Christmas, and with the team still mired in 14th place in the Western Conference, General Manager and Executive Vice President Darryl Sutter {{announced}} his resignation from both positions on December 28, exactly eight years after {{he was hired by}} the team to become its coach in 2002. The move <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> Sutter's decision, as he was asked by the organization to step aside. The decision came as a shock to many fans, even as it was believed to be inevitable following the team's decline in recent seasons. Jay Feaster assumed control of the team, serving as acting general manager.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{felt that}} his {{approach}} to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> successful. The Bard was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time {{found it hard to}} understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.|$|E

5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E
5|$|Rugby union <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> {{driven from}} Northern England, {{and in the}} 1970s the region was home to several strong teams. The high-water mark of rugby union in Northern England was the 1979 New Zealand tour during which the English Northern Division was the only team to defeat the All Blacks. In the 21st century the region's club sides have become less popular, with {{association}} football, cricket and rugby league attracting more spectators and talent. In the 2017–18 season, Sale Sharks and Newcastle Falcons play in the English Premiership, whereas Yorkshire Carnegie, Doncaster R.F.C. and Rotherham R.U.F.C. play in the RFU Championship.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{was well}} {{received}} by the Scotsman, but The Times Literary Supplement <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> enthusiastic:Among the little books that have become as much a manifestation of autumn as falling leaves, one looks first for whatever Miss Beatrix Potter gives... In her new book... {{although there is no}} diminution in the charm and drollery of the drawings, Miss Potter's fancy is not what it was. The story is inconclusive. Next year we think she must call in a literary assistant. We have no hesitation in calling her pencil perfect.|$|E
50|$|I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> {{comfortable}} with labeling this an anti-Mormon work, for I don't see {{hatred of the}} Church and a determination to destroy as the prime motive behind it. On the other hand, whatever the intention of individual authors, the label <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> misapplied either. In any case, one thing is sure: the compilation will be exploited by the Mormon-haters.|$|R

5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the battle}} at Winterthur made {{possible}} the victory at Zürich. Once the Austrian armies united west, north and east of Zürich, Charles decided he had a sufficiently superior force to attack Masséna's positions in Zürich. His strategy, to develop a converging attack, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> possible without another Austria corps, which was commanded by Suvorov, and positioned in the mountains in Italy; this would have {{made possible the}} near encirclement of Masséna's command at Zürich, making the French position untenable. Even so, at the First Battle of Zürich (4–7 June 1799), the Austrian army forced the French to abandon Zürich; Masséna withdrew across the Limmat, where {{he set up a}} defensive position on the low-lying hills overlooking the city and awaited his opportunity to reacquire the city.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing and the result <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> convincing. For {{the bulk of the}} scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
