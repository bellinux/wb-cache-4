5|$|M-222 is {{the current}} {{designation}} of a state trunkline highway in Allegan County of the US state of Michigan. It runs between the city of Allegan, where it connects with M-40/M-89, and the US Highway131 (US131) freeway near Martin. The highway runs along a series of streets in Allegan and through rural farm fields and woods between the two communities along 116th Avenue. The roadway was a state highway back in 1919 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was initially signed. It was assigned as part of M-89 and M-40 before being given its own number, M-118. That designation {{was applied to the}} highway until 1988 when that was retired in favor of the current M-222.|$|E
5|$|M-87 {{was assumed}} {{into the state}} {{trunkline}} system by July 1, 1919, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was first signed. At the time, the highway connected M-65 in Fenton with M-10 east of Holly. Later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, those two highways were renumbered US23 and US10 respectively. The highway was fully paved in 1937. In 1958, Fenton was bypassed by the Fenton–Clio Expressway {{to the west of}} downtown. and the former route through downtown was redesignated Bus. US23. M-87 was removed from the state trunkline system and turned back to local control in late 1960.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation results {{recently}} reported by Callison-Burch et al.

This happens, for instance, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> under evaluation are based on different paradigms, and therefore, do not share the same lexicon. The reason is that, while MT quality aspects are diverse, BLEU limits its scope to the lexical dimension. In this work, we suggest using metrics which take into account linguistic features at more abstract levels. We provide experimental results showing that metrics based on deeper linguistic information (syntactic/shallow-semantic) are able to produce more reliable system rankings than metrics based on lexical matching alone, specially <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> under evaluation are of a different nature. ...|$|R
5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E

5|$|The {{system that}} would become Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} from {{the western end of}} a frontal trough that stretched from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia. Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015millibars (29.99inHg), <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia.

5|$|Based on {{information}} from historical weather maps, {{it appeared that}} eastward-moving lower-atmospheric flow was present between September 16 and 17, though a closed circulation {{did not appear to}} be present. On September 18, the system developed into tropical depression between the Bahamas and Florida while it moved west-northwestward. After swiftly crossing the southern portion of the state, it strengthened into a tropical storm on September 19 over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and attained its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) early during September 20. It began turning north on September 21, and made landfall on the Mississippi coast on September 22. The storm weakened as it moved inland, and curved east-northeast later during that day, only to transition into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The storm lost extratropical characteristics over Virginia on September 23. As there were no reports of strong winds near the point of landfall, Partagás had doubt as to whether or not this storm was a tropical storm, as the most intense winds were recorded <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was classified as extratropical.|$|E
5|$|Early on September7, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{noted that}} {{although}} Maria {{was in an}} area of favorable atmospheric conditions, most intensity guidance models did not anticipate any strengthening. The system changed little in organization over the next 24hours as it moved rapidly toward the west-northwest around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. Though visible satellite imagery depicted a well-organized circulation center, it was displaced from the strongest convection due to increased vertical wind shear. The system reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) on September8 before the unfavorable environment began to impede the system's organization. Following a reconnaissance flight into the system early on September9, it was noted that Maria had degenerated into a non-tropical disturbance, despite reports of tropical storm-force winds in the northern Leeward Islands. Operationally, however, the NHC kept the system classified as a tropical cyclone and never downgraded it to a disturbance. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> approached the northern Leeward Islands on September10, satellite imagery and surface observations revealed an increase in its organization; a subsequent reconnaissance aircraft into the disturbance revealed that the remnants of Maria had regenerated into a tropical cyclone about 40mi (65km) east-southeast of Antigua.|$|E
5|$|On February23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection in the Mozambique Channel. On February25, Météo France (MF) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 13 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{was located}} along the southwest coast of Madagascar. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, noting that environmental conditions favored development, including weak wind shear. The system developed organized convection in a circular pattern, and on February26, the MF and JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 13 and Tropical Cyclone 19S, respectively. With a mid-level ridge to the south, the depression moved generally westward, and after intensifying further, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Japhet by the Direction de la Météorologie et de l'Hydrologie of Madagascar late on February26.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the early}} safety {{concerns}} appeared to be well founded <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> experienced a number of train-control failures in its {{first few years of}} operation. As early as 1969, before revenue service began, several BART engineers identified safety problems with the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The BART Board of Directors was dismissive of their concerns and retaliated by firing them. Less than a month after the system's opening, on October 2, 1972, an ATC failure caused a train to run off the end of the elevated track at the terminal Fremont station and crash to the ground, injuring four people. The “Fremont Flyer” led to a comprehensive redesign of the train controls and also resulted in multiple investigations being opened by the California State Senate, California Public Utilities Commission, and National Transportation Safety Board. Hearings by the state legislature in 1974 into financial mismanagement at BART forced the General Manager to resign in May 1974, and the entire Board of Directors was replaced the same year when the legislature passed legislation leading to the election of a new Board and the end of appointed members.|$|E
