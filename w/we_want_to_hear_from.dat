6000|$|... 2. This ends Christmas,(15) {{and what}} care I? I have neither seen, nor felt, nor heard any Christmas this year. I passed a lazy dull day. I was {{this morning with}} Lord Treasurer, to get some papers from him, which he will {{remember}} {{as much as a}} cat, although it be his own business. It threatened rain, but did not much; and Prior and I walked an hour in the Park, which quite put me out of my measures. I dined with a friend hard by; and in the evening sat with Lord Masham till twelve. Lord Treasurer did not come; this is an idle dining-day usually with him. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> Holland how our peace goes on; for we are afraid of those scoundrels the Dutch, lest they should play us tricks. Lord Mar,(16) a Scotch earl, was with us at Lord Masham's: I was arguing with him about the stubbornness and folly of his countrymen; they are so angry about the affair of the Duke of Hamilton, whom the Queen has made a duke of England, and the House of Lords will not admit him. He swears he would vote for us, but dare not, because all Scotland would detest him if he did: he should never be chosen again, nor be able to live there.|$|E

The agency is also going to give employees who are not a part of that focus group process an intranet virtual focus group where they can express their views and their concerns. The commissioner stated: [...] "We are looking at this very seriously. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> the employees, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> these focus groups, we want to drill down on this survey."

50|$|Amblyaudia is {{a deficit}} in {{binaural}} integration of environmental information entering the auditory system. It is a disorder related to brain organization and function {{rather than what}} is typically considered a “hearing loss” (damage to the cochlea). It may be genetic or developmentally acquired or both. When animals are temporarily deprived of hearing from an early age, profound changes occur in the brain. Specifically, cell sizes in brainstem nuclei are reduced, the configuration of brainstem dendrites are altered and neurons respond in different ways to sounds presented to both the deprived and non-deprived ears (in cases of asymmetric deprivation). This last point is particularly important for listening tasks that require inputs from two ears to perform well. There are multiple auditory functions that rely on the computation of well calibrated inputs from the two ears. Chief among these {{is the ability to}} localize sound sources and separate what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> a background of noise. In the brainstem, the auditory system compares the timing and levels of sounds between the two ears to encode the location of sound sources (sounds that originate from our right as opposed to left side are louder and arrive earlier in our right ear). This ability to separate sound sources not only helps us locate the trajectories of moving objects, but also to separate different sound sources in noisy environments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel audio only interface for selecting music which {{enables us to}} select songs without having to click a mouse.

The main advantage of our headphones is that they detect natural movements, such as the head or hand moving when users are listening to music and they can focus on a particular musical source that they want to hear. By moving their head left or right, listeners can hear the source from a frontal position as the digital compass detects the change in the direction they are facing. By looking up or down, the tilt sensor will detect the change in the face’s angle of elevation; they can better hear the source that is allocated to a more distant or closer position. By putting their hand behind their ear, listeners can adjust the focus sensor on the headphones to focus on a particular musical source that they want to hear...|$|E

40|$|Cooperation between {{customers}} and companies {{has existed for}} a long time. However, {{the role of a}} customer was rather passive and organizations were the ones who dictated their rules and took {{a leading role in the}} process of product creation. With a course of time the situation has been changed and customers are becoming more and more involved into the process of cooperation. As a customer driven innovation is relatively new phenomenon, the aim of our study is to examine its status in the modern business world. It can be observed that organizations all around the globe claim about their readiness and willingness to listen to {{customers and}} cooperate with them. Companies create customer support sections where they offer to leave complaints, comments and suggestions. Airline companies tend to have such experience. “We want to hear from you. Your feedback is important and helps us become a better airline” claims Delta Airlines. Tiger Airways states “Yes! <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> you! Submit your feedback via our Customer Support Portal”. And there is multitude of such examples. With the help of the investigation of theoretical material, survey conduction and examining practical examples we aim to examine the issue of customer involvement into cooperation with organizations as well as to found out how ready customers are for such collaboration...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of my thesis {{is to figure}} out how big is the {{influence}} of music used to promote products in the form of commercials. Do people link the music used in commercial with the product that the commercial was promoting when they hear it and so could the commercial become more effective if we use music that is commonly played in for example radios? I tried to figure this out by doing a qualitative research in my thesis. I was also looking into musical preferences in commercials. By applying a quantitative research I {{was trying to figure out}} how much do personal musical preferences affect what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> in commercials. My research commed with, for me, some interesting results. I found out, that most people do not link music with the commercial, that it was used in, when heard sepparately, no matter if the music is known more or less. I also figured out that personal musical preferences do not affect what music <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> in commercial as much as former expectations and stereotypes...|$|R

40|$|If {{a school}} has a {{marketing}} strategy, or 2 ̆ 7 markets 2 ̆ 7 itself, then it has probably invested significant time, if not money, in the associated activities. But if the school has not used some kind of market research {{to find out what}} parents want, or think they want, from the school, then the marketing efforts could well be missing the target. All schools have access to some kind of research data, which they can put to use {{in the development of a}} relevant and targeted marketing plan that will have the best chance of delivering results. The fatal flaw in many research programs, though, is that they are implemented without a clear-eyed view of what they are supposed to find out - and what will be done with the findings. Before any research, the school needs clear answers to some key questions: What do we want to know? Why do we want to know it? What will we do with the findings, however they turn out? Who needs to respond in order for any results to be meaningful? How do we do it? The key methods used are paper surveys, online surveys and focus groups. Market research tells the school what parents and potential parents want; what they look for; how they talk about it and how they need to hear what the school offers, when they need to hear it and from whom. Sometimes the most important thing when a school conducts surveys or focus groups asking for everyone to get involved is that it clearly sends a message: we are in this together, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> all parents and students and we care about what everyone has to offer. That alone can have a significant impact on boosting positive perceptions about a school and may be the most effective form of marketing or PR any school can undertake. [Author abstract, ed...|$|E
