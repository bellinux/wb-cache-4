25|$|It is {{suggested}} that {{about a fifth of}} the Turkish population are Alevis, whose folk music is performed by a type of travelling bard or ozan called aşık, who travels with the saz or baglama, an iconic image of Turkish folk music. These songs, which hail from the central northeastern area, are about mystical revelations, invocations to Alevi saints and Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, whom they hold in high esteem. In Turkish aşık literally means 'in love'. <b>Whoever</b> <b>follows</b> this tradition has the Aşık assignation put before their names, because it {{is suggested}} that music becomes an essential facet of their being, for example as in Aşık Veysel.|$|E

6000|$|Oh, this {{universal}} syllabub of philanthropic twaddle!

The worst, it is written, comes from corruption of the best:--Semitic forms now lying putrescent, dead and still unburied, this phosphorescence rises. I say sometimes, such a blockhead Idol, and miserable White Mumbo-jumbo, fashioned out of deciduous sticks and cast clothes, out of extinct cants and modern sentimentalisms, as that which they sing litanies to at Exeter Hall and extensively elsewhere, was perhaps never set up by human folly before.

5000|$|The New York Sun, {{in their}} May 11, 2006 editorial, {{pointed out that}} the letter {{followed}} the format of an Islamic missionary (Da'wa) message, including the traditional ending used by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in his Da'wa messages to the Byzantine Empire's leaders and the nomadic polytheist Arab tribes. The newspaper translated this phrase ("Wasalam Ala Man Ataba'al hoda") as [...] "peace only unto those who follow the true path", and interpreted it as a threat of violence. The phrase is more directly translated as [...] "and peace to <b>whoever</b> <b>follows</b> the path" [...] and is traditional with any Da'wa. The letter also included many references to Jesus as a Muslim prophet, a common signature of Da'wa letters directed towards Christians. The Islamic Republic News Agency says President Ahmadinejad confirmed that the letter was intended as a Da'wa invitation in a press conference.|$|E
5000|$|By 630, Islam was the {{dominant}} force in Arabia, and the tribes converged on Mecca to proclaim their acceptance of Islam, including a delegation from Najd called Banu Hanifah, who appointed Musailama ibn Habib as their spokesman. On {{his return to}} Najd, Musailama recanted his allegiance, claiming to be a prophet himself. For various reasons the Banu Hanilab rallied around him, mostly out of tribal loyalty (asabiyyah). One member of the tribe declared:"I testify that Muhammad is indeed truthful and that Musaylamah is indeed an imposter. But the impostor of Rabiah (the tribal confederation to which the Banu Hanifah belonged) is dearer {{to me that the}} genuine and truthful person from Mudar (the tribal confederation to which the Quraish belonged)." [...] Before long, the number of Musailama's followers increased and he felt powerful enough to write a letter to Muhammad;"From Musailama, the messenger of God to Muhammad, the messenger of God. Peace be on you. I am prepared to share this mission with you. I shall have (control over) half the land and you shall have the other half. But the Quraish are an aggressive people." [...] He then wrote to Musailama: [...] "In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Compassionate. From Muhammad the Messenger of God, to Musailama the imposter. Peace be upon <b>whoever</b> <b>follows</b> the guidance. God will bequeath the earth to whosoever of His servants He wishes and the final triumph will be for those who are careful of their duty to God." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{distinct}} thematic sections of this sura. [...] The first is an injunction for self-preparedness. If verse 1 {{refers to the}} Prophet Muhammed (al-Muddaththir, or cloaked one): You, wrapped in your cloak, then the second verse serves to alert the Prophet to a changing environment from which he is charged with saving mankind: Arise, and give warning (74:2). Verses 3-7 are injunctions, then, for the Prophet (or <b>whoever</b> <b>follows</b> the righteous path of God) to maintain cleanliness, monotheism, humility, and patience in his own life. These are all preparations for the revelation {{of the rest of}} the message. The next thematic section of Surat al-Muddaththir is a warning for the unbelievers. Verses 8-30 describe the rejection of God's word and the excruciating consequences that result. For he that has not been grateful for the bounty of God’s blessing and demands more, disregarding the signs and revelations of God, will be cast into the Saqar, which here refers to the scorching fire of Hell. This image of an unbeliever emphasizes the individuality of the responsibility of obeying God's message: the onus falls upon the individual man to save himself from Hell. Verse 30 refers to nineteen angels who guard the pit of hell; this curious detail is expounded upon in the following verse, which is believed to be a Medinan addition. Some scholars, such as Sayyid Qutb, have stated that verse 31 serves as an explanation of verse 30 that was added after early Muslims and unbelievers alike questioned the specificity of the nineteen angels: ...|$|E
