40|$|In this essay, I offer a {{sympathetic}} {{reading of the}} rhetoric(s) of Augustine’s Confessions. First, as a historian of rhetoric I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> what Augustine’s narrative {{can tell us about}} the theory and practice of rhetoric in the late classical period and the early Christian era. From this perspective, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> exploring what Augustine discloses about the rhetoric he learned in the provincial Roman schools, and taught at Carthage, Rome, and Milan. Second, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Augustine’s own work on rhetoric, especially his De Doctrina Christiana, most of which he composed during the period right before he began the Confessions. <b>In</b> particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how the rhetorical ethics that emerges from Augustine’s formal treatment of Biblical exegesis and preaching, and which distinguishes Augustine’s rhetoric from that of his classical predecessors, can illuminate our interpretation of the Confessions. Finally, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> exploring how the Confessions itself works as a rhetorical text— that is, as a discourse addressed to an audience for the purpose of influence. <b>In</b> particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> exploring the specific pastoral functions served by Augustine’s narrative...|$|R
