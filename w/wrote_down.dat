5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he <b>wrote</b> <b>down.</b> It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E
5|$|Offenbach often {{composed}} amidst {{noise and}} distractions. According to Keck, Offenbach would first {{make a note}} of melodies a libretto suggested {{to him in a}} notebook or straight onto the librettist’s manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration. When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a codified system.|$|E
40|$|In {{mathematical}} instruction, {{problem solving}} {{in a real}} life is usually actualized in form of word problems. In fact however the student’s ability in word problems is very poor. The low of student ability is shown {{with the number of}} errors they made. Hence error analysis needs to do to know where the students make mistakes. The method {{that can be used to}} analyze student’s errors is Newman’s Error Analysis (NEA). There are five steps in Newman’s Error Analysis Method, they are: reading, comprehension, transformation, process skill, and encoding. This study is aimed to describe: (1) errors that very often done by students in solving word problems, and (2) forms of error done by students in solving word problems. The study is a quantitative descriptive research. The study was implemented to students of SMP Muhammadiyah 06 DAU Malang grade of VIII-A. The data collection used test and interview. The data analysis used descriptive analysis to the forms of student’s error. While the simple statistical analysis is used to level of errors made by students in solving word problems in Newman’s prompt. The result of study shown that errors which very often done by students in solving word problems placed in encoding step. The errors in reading step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the meaning of word/phrase unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the meaning of word/phrase that is not very clear, give meaning of word/phrase incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the meaning of word/phrase at all. The errors in comprehension step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given components incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given components briefly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given and asked components incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the given and asked components at all. The errors in transformation step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the method unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the method incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the method at all. The errors in process skill step are: doing computation in wrong method, doing errors in computation, doing misconception, not continuing the procedure of solution, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> the procedure of solution. The errors in encoding step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding in properer unit, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding properly, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding at al...|$|R

5|$|As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were {{employed}} to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in a more sophisticated style {{than those of the}} late 17th century; many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> text with his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> {{the sequence of events}} that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} when the poem Lietuva, Tėvyne mūsų was written, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. Kudirka, a medical student at the University of Warsaw, was writing as a {{columnist}} for the newspaper Varpas (The Bell). In his Varpas columns, Kudirka urged Lithuanians to take pride in their heritage, discussed the problems the Russian Government was causing the Lithuanian population, and denounced those who wished to work for the Tsarist autocracy. In the course of writing for Varpas, he <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> his thoughts on what Lithuania was and what it should be, resulting in the fifty-word poem Lietuva, Tėvynė mūsų ("Lithuania, Our Homeland").|$|E

50|$|WDA {{applies to}} such amounts of {{allowable}} expenditure {{that are not}} relieved by either AIA or FYA. Broadly it requires all assets {{to be put into}} either a general pool, a special pool or a single-asset pool. Assets in the general pool are <b>written</b> <b>down</b> at 18% while those in the special pool are <b>written</b> <b>down</b> at 8%. An asset in a single-asset pool is <b>written</b> <b>down</b> at either 8% or 18% depending on its nature. The advantage is that, on disposal, the whole of the <b>written</b> <b>down</b> value may be offset against taxable profits. The whole balance of a pool may be written off if it falls below £1,000.|$|R

5|$|Jonathan Swift, as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{produced}} many sermons {{during his}} tenure from 1713 to 1745. Although Swift is better known today for his secular writings such as Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a Tub, or the Drapier's Letters, Swift was known in Dublin for his sermons that were delivered every fifth Sunday. Of these sermons, Swift <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> 35, of which 12 have been preserved. In his sermons Swift attempted to impart traditional Church of Ireland values to his listeners in a plain manner.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira's teachings were {{compiled}} by his Ganadhara (chief disciple), Gautama Swami. The sacred canonical scriptures comprised twelve parts. According to the Digambaras, Āchārya Bhutabali {{was the last}} ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. Later, some learned Āchāryas started to restore, compile, and write down the teachings of Mahavira that were {{the subject matter of}} the Agamas. Āchārya Dharasena, in the 1stcentury CE, guided Āchārya Pushpadant and Āchārya Bhutabali as they <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> these teachings.

5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

5|$|The classic view of Domitian {{is usually}} negative, {{since most of}} the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had {{notoriously}} difficult relations. Furthermore, contemporary historians such as Pliny the Younger, Tacitus and Suetonius all <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets Martial and Statius constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.|$|E

5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pool}} halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also {{broadcast}} horse races via telegraph. The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith's attention and he <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts. In the fall of 1879, Smith placed his first bet on a 5:1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island. He won $38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run. Determined that he could win at horse racing, Smith quit {{his job at the}} cork factory and accrued more than $5,000 from betting on horse races in the next two years, hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home. Upon his mother eventually discovering the money, he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing. By 1885, Smith had {{become one of the most}} touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over $100,000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand. However, Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh. He could not maintain the favorable, high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices.|$|E
