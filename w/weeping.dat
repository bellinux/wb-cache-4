5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, medlars, crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four <b>weeping</b> elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four <b>weeping</b> ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E
5|$|Westminster was surcharged with multitudes of {{all sorts}} of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came out to see the obsequy, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and <b>weeping</b> as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man.|$|E
5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were to be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, <b>weeping</b> when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's tombstone, {{featuring}} the muse of music, Euterpe, <b>weeping</b> over a broken lyre, {{was designed and}} sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid {{for the return of}} the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to have destroyed them.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{takes his}} companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{and her husband}} Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) to Central Park in New York City. There, recurring monsters the <b>Weeping</b> Angels send Rory back to the 1930s, where he is reunited with River Song (Alex Kingston), Amy and Rory's daughter. Amy and the Doctor attempt to rescue Rory, but the Doctor realises along the way that this adventure will be his last with Amy and Rory. Actors Gillan and Darvill both departed the series with this episode.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} David Tennant—and his companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) {{are trapped in}} the past and try to communicate with a young woman, Sally Sparrow (Carey Mulligan), to prevent the statue-like <b>Weeping</b> Angels from taking control of the TARDIS. Sparrow and her best friend's brother, Larry Nightingale (Finlay Robertson), must unravel a set of cryptic clues sent through time by the marooned Doctor, left in the abandoned estate Wester Drumlins which the Angels currently occupy.|$|E
5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad never meant his poem to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or to the trees of any special region. Just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, {{and that would be}} suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out <b>weeping</b> willows.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1953, Stalin {{suffered}} a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep. Stalin had left orders {{not to be}} disturbed, and it was twelve hours until his condition was discovered. Even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. As Khrushchev and other high officials stood <b>weeping</b> by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Emperor's speech varied–many Japanese simply listened to it, then went {{on with their lives}} as best they could, while some Army and Navy officers chose suicide over surrender. At a base north of Nagasaki, some Japanese Army officers, enraged at the prospect of surrender, pulled some 16 captured American airmen out of the base prison and hacked them to death with swords. A large, <b>weeping</b> crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, with their cries sometimes interrupted by the sound of gunshots as military officers present committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{memorials}} were erected {{to commemorate}} the dead. In Silver Spring, a plaque was placed on a bridge above the crash site. In Brunswick, there is a stone with the names and pictures of the three CSX crewmen engraved on it. The stone was paid for by private donations. The eight passengers who died were all students at the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Center. Students there erected a memorial flanked by <b>weeping</b> cherry trees.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, Amy, River, and Father Octavian and his {{surviving}} clerics {{escape the}} approaching <b>Weeping</b> Angels when the Doctor destroys the gravity globe illuminating the cave they are in, {{allowing them to}} jump up into the gravity well of the crashed starship Byzantium. They scramble inside as the Angels start to follow, and the Doctor directs the group to the ship's oxygen factory, a forest contained within the ship. As they pass the primary control room, the Doctor notices a familiar crack in its wall, leaking time energy that the Angels are being drawn to.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Tina in a dream, Rahul and {{his family}} go to Anjali's wedding, where Rahul silently confesses to Anjali that he loves her, and watches in tears as she is brought forth for the wedding. Realising this, Anjali is {{hesitant}} {{to go on with}} the marriage, and stands <b>weeping.</b> Aman notices the tears in her eyes and realises that she has always been in love with Rahul. He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul. Rahul and Anjali have an emotional hug and as the two marry, little Anjali Khanna sees a vision of Tina, who is smiling and giving her the thumbs up. Rahul and Anjali Sharma get married.|$|E
5|$|Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) go out {{in search}} of Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz), {{following}} her mother Carol (Melissa McBride) <b>weeping</b> for her loss. Daryl tells Andrea about his childhood, and expresses {{hope that they will}} successfully locate Sophia. They stumble upon an abandoned campsite, where a person had committed suicide by hanging themselves from a tree and now has become an undead walker. Daryl insists that they leave the walker alone, but Andrea firmly refuses. He asks her if she wants to continue living, to which she exclaims uncertainty. Daryl euthanizes the walker as they leave. Upon returning to the camp, Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) attempts to reconcile with Andrea by returning her handgun.|$|E
5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and <b>weeping</b> and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
5|$|Father Octavian orders them to set {{out through}} a cave system to reach the Byzantium, using a gravity globe to {{illuminate}} the cave. The Doctor and River comment on the various statues they pass, believing they are made by the planet's natives, until they recall the natives are two-headed beings and the statues are only single-headed. They conclude they must be weakened <b>Weeping</b> Angels, and that the Angel on the Byzantium purposely crashed the ship here to rescue its kind. The Angels start to pursue the group. Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises {{that the image of}} the Angel still exists in her eye and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, and they continue to flee.|$|E
5|$|Following the cliffhanger of the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith), his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), River Song, and Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics have escaped entrapment by the <b>Weeping</b> Angels, creatures who only move when unobserved by others. They take refuge inside the crashed starship Byzantium, but the Angels pursue them and Amy is {{on the brink of}} dying from the imprint of an Angel in her eye. Both the Angels and the Doctor's team face danger from a widening crack in space and time which has the power to erase persons from history.|$|E
5|$|Haakon {{takes hold}} of the ring, and, {{seemingly}} to Sigmund, she clasps her hand around it. Haakon does not receive the ring. Haakon casts himself down before her a second time, and Sigmund notices that Haakon is <b>weeping.</b> He stands up again, {{takes hold of}} the ring, and finds {{that it has become}} loose. Haakon gives the ring to Sigmund, and tells him that he must never part with it. Sigmund gives him his word on it and the men part, each returning to their ships. A storm appears and the two ships are swept apart, and many days are described as passing afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their <b>weeping,</b> Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Sally Sparrow enters Wester Drumlins, an {{abandoned}} house, {{to look for}} subjects to photograph. Instead she finds eerie statues and {{a message from the}} Doctor behind peeling wallpaper addressed to her, warning her about the <b>Weeping</b> Angels. Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale to explore further but Kathy disappears {{at the same time a}} young man knocks at the door. He claims to be Kathy's grandson and delivers a letter to Sally. The letter, written by Kathy, explains that she suddenly found herself in the 1920s in Hull. She settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and requests that Sally tell Kathy's brother Larry of her disappearance. Sally sees a Yale key hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.|$|E
5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of <b>weeping</b> women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E
5|$|Only then, in April 879, did Ibn Tulun {{return to}} Egypt. Abbas fled west with his supporters, and from Barqa {{tried to take}} over Ifriqiya. Defeated by the Ifriqiyans (probably {{in the winter of}} 880–881), he retreated back east to Alexandria, where he was finally confronted and {{captured}} by Ibn Tulun's forces. After being publicly paraded seated on a mule, Ibn Tulun ordered his son to execute or mutilate his companions, who had driven him to rebel. Ibn Tulun reportedly secretly hoped that his son would refuse to do such a dishonourable act, but he agreed. <b>Weeping,</b> Ibn Tulun had Abbas whipped and imprisoned. He then named his second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir-apparent.|$|E
5|$|Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has {{suffered}} complications arising {{from a new}} pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett returns to their home in Atlanta; realizing that Ashley only ever truly loved Melanie, Scarlett dashes after Rhett to find him preparing to leave for good. She pleads with him, telling him she realizes now that she has loved him all along and that she never really loved Ashley, but Rhett says that with Bonnie's death went any chance of reconciliation. Scarlett begs him to stay but Rhett rebuffs her and walks {{out the door and}} into the early morning fog, leaving her <b>weeping</b> on the staircase and vowing to one day win back his love.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) are summoned by River Song, a mysterious {{woman from the}} Doctor's future. She takes them to the planet Alfava Metraxis, where the spaceship Byzantium has crashed. Hidden inside is a <b>Weeping</b> Angel, a creature that can only move when unobserved by others. With the help of Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics, the Doctor, Amy and River Song travel through a stone labyrinth to reach the ship. On the way, they discover that all the statues in the maze are Angels, which are slowly restoring and planning to trap them in the labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself <b>weeping</b> with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, <b>weeping</b> in the house.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} {{most of the last}} year of his life in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly <b>weeping</b> at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for the day as a tribute.|$|E
5|$|Giles' dream {{presents}} a choice: either {{to remain a}} father figure and Watcher to Buffy, or to begin his own life, represented {{by the presence of}} his girlfriend Olivia, who pushes an empty baby stroller. During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen <b>weeping,</b> while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a <b>Weeping</b> Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E
5|$|Seven trails with round-trip {{times of}} {{half an hour}} (<b>Weeping</b> Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon. Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City. Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer. However, hiking beyond Big Springs {{requires}} a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking. A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek. The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy {{a picnic}} in New York's Central Park in 2012, with the Doctor {{reading from a}} pulp novel about a 1930s detective named Melody Malone. Despite Amy's insistence, the Doctor refuses to read ahead to reveal {{spoilers}} and tears out the last page of the book. Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub <b>Weeping</b> Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory written into the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her that anything she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|The colour of the L.volemus {{mushroom}} {{varies from}} apricot to tawny, and the cap may {{be up to}} 11cm (in) wide. The pale golden yellow gills {{on the underside of}} the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of latex ("milk") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to the common names <b>weeping</b> milk cap and voluminous-latex milky. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which does not affect the taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several sterols related to ergosterol, some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a natural rubber that has been chemically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Lactifluus volemus represents several species or subspecies, rather than a single taxon.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. It {{has more}} than sixty grass species and a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and <b>weeping</b> willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other exotic species in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated.|$|E
5|$|The walrus {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the <b>weeping</b> girl or her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and <b>weeping</b> uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges <b>weeping</b> with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
