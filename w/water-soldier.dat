500|$|Dragonflies {{as a group}} {{occupy a}} {{considerable}} variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as Sympetrum (darters) [...] have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in Aeshna viridis (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the <b>water-soldier,</b> Stratiotes aloides. The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too eutrophic, not too acid; a few species such as Sympetrum danae (black darter) and Libellula quadrimaculata (four-spotted chaser) prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs, while others such as Libellula fulva (scarce chaser) need slow-moving, eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.|$|E
60|$|It {{all seemed}} like a dream to Ursula, perhaps {{likewise}} to her mother, when they rose to the routine of daily life with the ordinary interests of the day before them. There was a latent unwillingness in Mrs. Egremont's mind to discuss the subject with either aunt or daughter; and when the post brought no letter, Ursula, after a moment's sense of flatness, was relieved, {{and returned to her}} eager desire to hurry after the <b>water-soldier.</b> It was feasible that very afternoon. Mary Nugent came in with the intelligence.|$|E
60|$|They {{fought over}} the floriations and {{mouldings}} with great zest, and each maintained {{a date with}} youthful vigour--both being, as Mr. Dutton by and by showed them, long before the foundation. The pond had been left to the last {{with a view to}} the wellbeing of the <b>water-soldier</b> on the return. Here the difficulties of the capture were great, for the nearest plant flourished too far from the bank to be reached with comfort, and besides, the sharp-pointed leaves to which it owes its name were not to be approached with casual grasps.|$|E
60|$|The Ravensbrook of {{my earlier}} {{memories}} {{was a beautiful}} stream. It came into my world out of a mysterious Beyond, out of a garden, splashing brightly down a weir which {{had once been the}} weir of a mill. (Above the weir and inaccessible there were bulrushes growing in splendid clumps, and beyond that, pampas grass, yellow and crimson spikes of hollyhock, and blue suggestions of wonderland.) From the pool at the foot of this initial cascade it flowed in a leisurely fashion beside a footpath,--there were two pretty thatched cottages on the left, and here were ducks, and there were willows on the right,--and so came to where great trees grew on high banks on either hand and bowed closer, and at last met overhead. This part was difficult to reach because of an old fence, but a little boy might glimpse that long cavern of greenery by wading. Either I have actually seen kingfishers there, or my father has described them so accurately to me that he inserted them into my memory. I remember them there anyhow. Most of that overhung part I never penetrated at all, but followed the field path with my mother and met the stream again, where beyond there were flat meadows, Roper's meadows. The Ravensbrook went meandering across the middle of these, now between steep banks, and now with wide shallows at the bends where the cattle waded and drank. Yellow and purple loose-strife and ordinary rushes grew in clumps along the bank, and now and then a willow. On rare occasions of rapture one might see a rat cleaning his whiskers at the water's edge. The deep places were rich with tangled weeds, and in them fishes lurked--to me they were big fishes--water-boatmen and water-beetles traversed the calm surface of these still deeps; in one pool were yellow lilies and <b>water-soldiers,</b> and in the shoaly places hovering fleets of small fry basked in the sunshine--to vanish in a flash at one's shadow. In one place, too, were Rapids, where the stream woke with a start from a dreamless brooding into foaming panic and babbled and hastened. Well do I remember that half-mile of rivulet; all other rivers and cascades have their reference to it for me. And after I was eleven, and before we left Bromstead, all the delight and beauty of it was destroyed.|$|R

One good thing is, we shall get the <b>water-soldier.</b> Mr. Dutton needn't come, for he's like a cat, and won't soil his boots, but Gerard is dying to get {{another look at the}} old ruin. He can't make up his mind about the cross on one of the stone-coffin lids, so he'll be delighted to come, and he'll {{get it out of the}} pond for us. I wonder when we can go.

6000|$|He {{advanced}} upon Nuttie, {{took her}} by the hand and kissed her forehead before she was aware, but she flashed at him with her black eyes, and looked stiff and defiant. She had no notion of kisses to herself, still less to her pretty mother whom she protected with a half proud, half jealous fondness. How could the man presume to call her by that foolish name? However, that single effusion had exhausted Mark's powers of cordiality, or else Nuttie's stiffness froze him. They were all embarrassed, and had reason to be grateful to Lady Kirkaldy's practised powers as a diplomate's wife. She made the most of Mrs. Egremont's shy spasmodic inquiries, and Mark's jerks of information, such as that they were all living at Bridgefield Egremont, now, that his sister May was very like his new cousin, that Blanche was come out and was very like his mother, etc. etc. Every one was more at ease when Lady Kirkaldy carried the conversation off to yesterday's entertainment, hoping no one had been overtired, and the like. Mrs. Egremont lighted up a little and began telling some of the expressions of delight she had heard, and in the midst, Nuttie, waking from her trance of stiff displeasure, came plump in with 'Oh! and there's a <b>water-soldier,</b> a real Stratiotes aculeatus in your lake. May we get it? Mr. Dutton didn't think we ought, but it would be such a prize!' ...|$|E

40|$|A case {{is argued}} for {{considering}} Stratiotes aloides L. (<b>Water-soldier)</b> (Hydrocharitaceae) of native status in Co. Fermanagh (v. c. H 33), and possibly elsewhere in Ireland. The case is circumstantial {{in the absence}} of fossil evidence from the current interglacial, and consists of early 19 th century discovery, long persistence in natural water bodies, rare and scattered occurrence, and lack of the "boom and bust " dynamics of many introduced aquatic species. No new stations have been found for over 100 years which strongly suggests that either S. aloides is not much used in Irish water gardens, or it does not readily escape into the wild. The species complement of two vegetation communities involving S. aloides in Upper Lough Erne, Co. Fermanagh is strikingly similar to communities described in the Norfolk Broads, where the species has long been considered native. Conservation arguments for sites frequently revolve around the occurrence of rare indigenous species, making the question of status more than a purely academic matter...|$|E
