25|$|To form a {{color with}} RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be {{superimposed}} (for example by emission {{from a black}} screen or by reflection from a <b>white</b> <b>screen).</b> Each of the three beams is called a component of that color, {{and each of them}} can have an arbitrary intensity, from fully off to fully on, in the mixture.|$|E
25|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun {{with the naked eye}} permanently damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose hydrogen-alpha narrow bandpass filters and aluminum-coated glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high optical density) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.|$|E

25|$|The series six opening titles have {{cut-outs}} of each character, as they {{fade into}} the <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> and zoom in and out and eventually stop moving. The line-up {{from left to right}} is Abi, Michael, Susan, Ben, Janey and Roger. The titles remain the same for series seven and eight; the one difference is that Janey's clothes are changed. In series nine, the line-up changes due to Abi's departure {{at the end of the}} previous series. Her place is taken by Alfie, who has been a regular since series six but never appeared in the titles until the ninth series. Starting in the 2009 Christmas Special, Alfie has been replaced by Kenzo.|$|E
25|$|The device {{featured}} a small 1.55inch multi-touch screen {{with a lower}} resolution of 240×240 pixels but a higher pixel density of 220 pixels per inch, as opposed to the larger 2.2inch screen on the fifth-generation iPod Nano. The device had a 0.39 watt-hour battery rated at 3.7 volts, giving a capacity of 105 mAh, and specified to give 24 hours of music playback on a single full charge. The device took about three hours for one full charge. The device retained the same 30-pin dock connector as previous generations. This Nano lost the previous generation's video camera, built-in voice recorder microphone (although plugging in headphones with a built in microphone revealed a Voice Memos app) and built-in speaker, and games. It also lost support for video playback, but music videos and video podcasts (vodcasts) could be synced onto the device, and the audio from them would play on the device, with a single key-frame shown on the screen. It still included the Nike+iPod fitness option as well as an FM radio tuner with RDS (Radio Data System). It had a black on <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> contrast option and other accessibility options. The 6th generation iPod Nano had the same price point as the 5th generation device.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the film, Dante {{attempted}} to involve his audience in the story by making it seem as if the gremlins had taken control of the theatre where Gremlins 2 was showing. The film strip appears to be broken by the gremlins, who then engage in shadow puppetry over a <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> before replacing the reel with the vintage nudie film Volleyball Holiday. Hulk Hogan then makes a cameo appearance as an audience member and intimidates the gremlins into running the rest of Gremlins 2. This joke was inspired by a similar stunt in William Castle's film The Tingler (1959). The studio feared that people might leave the theatre if they thought the film had broken; Dante therefore secured the inclusion of the sequence by assembling some people for a preview of the film. When the scene was shown, the real-life audience found it enjoyable and stayed in the theatre. Dante later described this scene {{as one of the most}} widely enjoyed jokes in Gremlins 2. When the film made its debut on home video, the filmmakers replaced the scene, to make it seem as if the viewer's VCR had been broken by the gremlins. In this version, the gremlins do their shadow puppetry over white noise before changing the VCR's channels. Their antics stop at a broadcast of Chisum, where John Wayne forces the gremlins into continuing the film, although voice impersonation was needed since Wayne had been dead since 1979; actor Chad Everett was recommended by Wayne's son Patrick Wayne. Notably, a clip from Falling Hare, a film released in 1943 featuring Bugs Bunny and a gremlin, appears in this version. These sequences occur in lieu of the Hulk Hogan sequence which also featured Paul Bartel; home video audiences would not see these sequences until the DVD release (which includes the reworked VHS scene as a bonus feature).|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{stretching}} {{in front of}} a wall-mirror, while traffic noise is heard. During the first verse, Madonna is shown in a chic Chanel black dress with retro makeup. As the bridge of the song builds up, she is shown dancing {{in front of a}} <b>white</b> <b>screen,</b> wearing a French cap, and standing on a sofa. When the chorus of the song plays, she dances while holding an archlight, and fondles with long black fur. The second verse shows Madonna and Williams trading shots, with Williams wearing sunglasses in some scenes. At the [...] "Get stupid" [...] interlude, Williams is shown dragging a bag along the floor behind Madonna. The video concludes with an exhausted Madonna, falling asleep on the studio floor.|$|E
500|$|Due to a {{significant}} wealthy East Asian clientele of gamblers which the casino attracts, it is a restaurant with Chinese chefs serving authentic Chinese cuisine. The bright and luminous interior contains no direct lighting; rather, an overhead metal-cut <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> and large aquariums filled with goldfish are all backlit by LED bulbs. Halogen track lighting spotlights each table. The lighting system won a commendation from Architectural Lighting magazine in its 2009 AL Design Awards. The authors of Eating Las Vegas 2012 wrote: [...] "Combining classic Chinese peasant and street food with a super-cool design, the place looks like it's been draped in a gigantic white, transparent metal doily, and is meant to resemble either inverted Chinese lace cut into an arabesque pattern or the inside of an inverted bird's nest – all very symbolic and all very Chinese. The food is fabulous, especially the Imperial seafood-soup dumplings (which everyone comes for) and the Chef's Special beef pancake".|$|E
500|$|The show {{opened with}} Beastie Boys {{performing}} six of their songs for 30 minutes. They {{were accompanied by}} their DJ, Rick Rubin, who scratched the music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience. As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box". She continued with [...] "Everybody", while asking the audience to clap along with her. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of [...] "Angel" [...] started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change.|$|E
30|$|As in {{the test}} for study aim 1, health {{literacy}} was significant in both screening models. Low health literacy was consistently associated with lower breast and cervical cancer screening. The test of study aim 2 was also consistent. The addition of the low health literacy, while significantly associated with cancer screening, did not diminish the Asian vs. <b>white</b> <b>screening</b> disparities.|$|R

500|$|Following her {{performance}} at the Billboard Music Awards, Beyoncé initially received widespread praise from fans, critics and celebrities. However, the following day, [...] critics voiced concerns about similarities to a performance by Italian pop star Lorella Cuccarini in February 2010 at the 60th Sanremo Music Festival. Billy Johnson, Jr of Yahoo! Music wrote: [...] "Kenzo Digital, who spent a month creating Beyoncé's interactive video, told Yahoo! News that Lorella concert footage {{is only part of}} the inspiration for Beyoncé's show: [...] " [...] are awesome and do incredible work as well, but there are a lot of different inspirations for where our piece came from."

That's really nothing new. It's not even a new technology. It's just an incredibly simple, awesome storytelling device, and with a performer like Beyoncé it becomes incredibly powerful." [...] Beyoncé later responded through an interview with AOL Music, saying she was inspired after finding Cuccarini's performance online: ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the third series, four {{rectangle}} blocks fall onto a completely <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> to create Ben's face. Those blocks are then replaced with blocks that create Susan's face; each block then shows different parts of the other characters to finally reveal Nick's face. It continues to do this for Janey, Michael and (starting from the fourth episode entitled [...] "Of Mice and Ben") the new character to the show Abi. Abi's (for the first three episodes, Michael's) face then falls into the bottom right corner while the previous faces spread across to other places of the <b>white</b> <b>screen.</b> It reveals that Nick, Janey and Michael are next to Abi and Ben and Susan are with each other at the top left of the screen.

Nine bright brass cannons peeped out at us from her portholes. Above the line of hammocks, which hung like carded wool along her bulwarks, we could see the heads of the seamen staring down at us, and pointing us out to each other.

60|$|It was {{too early}} yet for the work to have begun in the dock. The water gleamed placidly, no {{movement}} anywhere in the long straight lines of the quays, no one about to be seen except the few dock hands busy alongside the Ferndale, knowing their work, mostly silent or exchanging a few words in low tones as if they, too, had been aware of that lady `who mustn't be disturbed.' The Ferndale was the only ship to leave that tide. The others seemed still asleep, without a sound, and only {{here and there a}} figure, coming up on the forecastle, leaned on the rail to watch the proceedings idly. Without trouble and fuss and almost without a sound was the Ferndale leaving the land, as if stealing away. Even the tugs, now with their engines stopped, were approaching her without a ripple, the burly-looking paddle-boat sheering forward, while the other, a screw, smaller and of slender shape, made for her quarter so gently that she did not divide the smooth water, but seemed to glide on its surface as if on a sheet of plate-glass, a man in her bow, the master at the wheel visible only from the waist upwards above the <b>white</b> <b>screen</b> of the bridge, both of them so still-eyed as to fascinate young Powell into curious self-forgetfulness and immobility. He was steeped, sunk in the general quietness, remembering the statement `she's a lady that mustn't be disturbed,' and repeating to himself idly: `No. She won't be disturbed. She won't be disturbed.' Then the first loud words of that morning breaking that strange hush of departure with a sharp hail: `Look out for that line there,' made him start. The line whizzed past his head, one of the sailors aft caught it, and there was an end to the fascination, to the quietness of spirit which had stolen on him at the very moment of departure. From that moment till two hours afterwards, when the ship was brought up in one of the lower reaches of the Thames off an apparently uninhabited shore, near some sort of inlet where nothing but two anchored barges flying a red flag could be seen, Powell was too busy to think of the lady `that mustn't be disturbed,' or of his captain--or of anything else unconnected with his immediate duties. In fact, he had no occasion to go on the poop, or even look that way much; but while the ship was about to anchor, casting his eyes in that direction, he received an absurd impression that his captain (he was up there, of course) was sitting {{on both sides of the}} aftermost skylight at once. He was too occupied to reflect on this curious delusion, this phenomenon of seeing double as though he had had a drop too much. He only smiled at himself.|$|E
