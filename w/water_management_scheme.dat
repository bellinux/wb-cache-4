A 1 -D, two-phase PEMFC model that offers both a very short simulation time and a realistic capture of the physical behavior of PEMFC is developed. The presence of liquid water in the cathode gas diffusion layer is modeled by using a simplified treatment of the mass balance of water. The simulation results are compared to the published experimental data and a satisfactory agreement is obtained. The proposed model is used to predict the cell performance under various operating conditions, and its capability to predict an abrupt fall in the cell voltage under flooding condition is demonstrated. The model equations developed, except for the average liquid water saturation, are analytical and require a minimal computational effort, hence reduces the overhead time in PEMFC power system simulations. © 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInstitutional {{obstacles}} to integrated water {{management at the}} river basin scale have been discussed in detail in the water governance literature, {{but there has been}} less attention to the development of analytical framework for understanding local government cooperation. In this study, a median voter model was developed to describe the political processes by which municipalities lend their support to land-use control in river basin management planning. Relative income, population growth, and land cover data — as measured at municipality level — are advanced to be the main determinants of municipalities׳ positioning on additional environmental zoning. The consultation process for the SAGE (planning and <b>water</b> <b>management</b> <b>scheme)</b> for the Gironde estuary and associated areas was used as a case study. Spatial logit estimation of the determinants of the results of voting in this consultation process suggests that municipalities׳ decisions are strongly influenced by the landscape preferences of the median voter. Acceptance of the SAGE project is an increasing function of relative income and population growth, as measured at municipality level. Furthermore, the municipalities that reject it are mainly those with the largest agricultural areas. The results confirm the existence of a very strong political component in the process by which a municipality decides whether or not to support a river basin plan. This decision can be linked to the preservation of natural landscape amenities in peripheral areas, while elsewhere it is connected to the protection of farming.

40|$|Introduced Marine Pests (IMPs) pose {{a serious}} threat to marine {{biodiversity}} in Australia. There are many ways pests are introduced into the marine environment. The major vectors for IMPs are ballast water, ship fouling, accidental introductions due to mariculture and deliberate introduction. The focus of this paper is on the administrative and legislative response to the introduction of IMPs through ballast water. Historically, ballast water accounts for only 15 - 20 per cent of the invasive marine species found in Australia. Ballast water is, however, becoming the major threatening vector in the last two decades. The current ballast water legislative and administrative framework in Australia contains a number of gaps and overlaps because both the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory have implemented their own regime {{to deal with the problem}} of IMPs in ballast water. This article analyzes the effectiveness and scope of the current Commonwealth and State/Territory legislative and administrative regimes designed to prevent the introduction of introduced marine pests through ballast water in Australian waters.

40|$|In the Ebro Delta coastal lagoons, one of {{the main}} {{anthropogenic}} pressures is the artificial freshwater input. Each coastal lagoon has different <b>water</b> <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> causing profound changes in its physicochemical characteristics. The main objective of this <b>water</b> <b>management</b> is to favour some bird species with interest either for conservation or hunting activities. The present study assesses the influence of hydrological alteration on the fish assemblages of three coastal lagoons in the Ebro Delta. The small-bodied fish fauna was mainly composed of five families: Gobiidae, Poecilidae, Cyprinodontidae, Atherinidae and Mugilidae. Salinity was found to be the main factor structuring fish community in the lagoons. The dominant species was the common goby (Pomatochistus microps) when the lagoons reached higher salinity values, whereas the invasive eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) dominated during the period of higher freshwater inputs. The juveniles of the family Mugilidae showed low catch per unit effort, especially during the period of lower salinity. This same pattern was found for the endangered Spanish toothcarp (Aphanius iberus). Overall, introduced species were favoured by low salinity, which highlights the importance of changing the present <b>water</b> <b>management</b> by reducing the freshwater inputs in order to maintain suitable levels of salinity to favour native species that are important for both commercial and conservation purposes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{countries}} of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin agriculture consumes 87 % of the total water resources. Concurrently the water demand of tourism sites develops rapidly. The increasing water competition between these two vital sectors endangers the economic prosperity of the entire region. While agriculture provides the living basis for most of the rural population, tourism carries hopes for increasing wealth and employment in the region. Sustainable <b>water</b> <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> are urgently needed, since the water conflicts lead to severe overuse of the natural water resources. Such a sustainable <b>water</b> <b>management</b> requires the exploitation of the large marginal water sources of the region. Large-scale implementations of water purification and desalination technologies require huge energy amounts. Biomass is a very suitable basis for providing the water related energy needs. The region has abundant agricultural residues from cereals, corn or palm tree plantations. Moreover, the climatic conditions are favourable for energy crops, which can be irrigated with brackish water. The implementation of biomass based waters supply schemes needs a comprehensive approach of all stakeholders in the private and public sector tackling simultaneously energy and water related issues. This approach best can be achieved by formulating intersectorial <b>water</b> <b>management</b> plans. An integrated model for sustainable water action plans is a valuable tool for supporting the preparation of biomass based water action plans easier on local and regional level...|$|R

Lund, and Ellen Hanak doi: [URL] Water {{exports from}} California’s Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta are an {{environmental}} concern because they reduce net outflows {{of fresh water}} from the Delta, and can entrain fish and disrupt flows within the Delta. If exports were no longer pumped from within the Delta, the regulatory issue becomes one of maintaining appropriate flows {{into and out of}} the Delta. This paper presents the results of two sets of hydro-economic optimization modeling runs, which were developed to represent a range of modified Delta operations and their economic and operational effects on California’s water supply system. The first set of runs represents decreasing export capacity from the Delta. The second set increases minimum net Delta outflow (MNDO) requirements. The hydro-economic model seeks the least–cost statewide <b>water</b> <b>management</b> <b>scheme</b> for water supply, including a wide range of resources and water management options. Results show that reducing exports or increasing MNDO requirements increase annual average statewide water scarcity, scarcity costs, and operating costs (from greater use of desalination, wastewater recycling, water treatment, and pumping). Effects of reduced exports are especially concentrated in agricultural communities in the southern Central Valley because of their loss of access to overall water supply exports and their ability to transfer remaining water to southern California. Increased outflow requirements increase water scarcity and associated costs throughout California. For an equivalent amount of average Delta outflows, statewide costs increase more rapidly when exports alone are reduced than when minimum outflow requirements are increased and effects are more widely distributed statewide...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{innovative}} process by which citizens in Bangalore, India have become engaged {{with the problem of}} water management through rainwater harvesting. Bangalore currently faces a water shortage of 500 million liters per day and, unless it dramatically changes its approach, acute water shortage by 2025. An effective <b>water</b> <b>management</b> <b>scheme</b> in Bangalore requires institutional restructuring to enable integrated management of water resources, strong legislation to protect groundwater, major infrastructural improvements to limit leakage, a shift in planning culture that more explicitly recognizes the link between the natural world and human settlements and stronger integration of science in planning. It is clear that any one of these actions is not easily implementable in the near term due to institutional, financial, and political challenges. In the absence of any near-term solutions for the water crisis, civil society has {{played a critical role in}} pushing the local water authority to make rainwater harvesting mandatory through the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Act, 2009. This thesis aims to add to two larger theoretical discussions: governing the commons and finding innovative solutions and processes for resource management. Governing the commons, especially in the dynamic context of rapidly growing cities that face systemic scarcity, requires a strong state to effectively restrict wasteful practices and mining of resources and a strong civil society to curb demand. As such, the scarcity-induced innovation framework (Srinivas and Sutz, 2008) has been applied to identify rainwater harvesting as an innovative approach to engage citizens in the heart of water management and curb demand. Rainwater harvesting is not presented here as a panacea, nor is it meant to distract from the need for the state to play a much stronger regulatory and implementation role...|$|E
40|$|The ODYSSEUS project (from the Greek acronym of {{its full}} title "Integrated Management of Hydrosystems in Conjunction with an Advanced Information System") aims at {{providing}} support to decision-makers towards integrated water resource management. The end-product comprises {{a system of}} co-operating software applications, suitable to handle {{a wide spectrum of}} water resources problems. The key methodological concepts are the holistic modelling approach, through the conjunctive representation of processes regarding water quantity and quality, man-made interventions, the parsimony of both input data requirements and system parameterization, the assessment of uncertainties and risks, and the extended use of optimization both for modelling (within various scales) and derivation of management policies. The core of the system is a relational database, named HYDRIA, for storing hydrosystem information; this includes geographical data, raw and processed time series, characteristics of measuring stations and facilities, and a variety of economic, environmental and water quality issues. The software architecture comprises various modules. HYDROGNOMON supports data retrieval, processing and visualization, and performs a variety of time series analysis tasks. HYDROGEIOS integrates a conjunctive hydrological model within a systems-oriented <b>water</b> <b>management</b> <b>scheme,</b> which estimates the available water resources at characteristic sites of the river basin and at the underlying aquifer. HYDRONOMEAS is the hydrosystem control module and locates optimal operation policies that minimize the risk and cost of decision-making. Additional modules are employed to prepare input data. DIPSOS estimates water needs for various uses (water supply, irrigation, industry, etc.), whereas RYPOS estimates pollutant loads from point and non-point sources, at a river basin scale. A last category comprises post-processing modules, for evaluating the proposed management policies by means of economical efficiency and water quality requirements. The latter include sophisticated models that estimate the space and time variation of specific pollutants within rivers (HERIDANOS) and lakes (LERNE), as well as simplified versions of them to be used within the hydrosystem simulation scheme. An interactive framework enables the exchange of data between the various modules, either off-line (through the database) or on-line, via appropriate design of common information structures. The whole system is in the final phase of its development and parts of it have been already tested in operational applications, by water authorities, organizations and consulting companies...|$|E

40|$|Considering water {{resource}} scarcity and uncertainty in climate and demand futures, decision-makers require techniques for sustainability analysis in resource management. Through unclear definitions of “sustainability”, however, traditional indices for resource evaluation propose options of limited flexibility by adopting static climate and demand scenarios, limiting analysis variables {{to a particular}} water-use group and time. This work proposes a robust, multivariate, dynamic sustainability evaluation technique and corresponding performance indicator called Measure of Sustainability (MoS) for resource management that is more adapted to withstand future parameter variation. The range of potential future climate and demand scenarios is simulated through a calibrated hydrological model of Copiapó, Chile, a case study example of an arid watershed under extreme natural and anthropogenic water stresses.
