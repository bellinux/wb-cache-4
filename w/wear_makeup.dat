5|$|In 1956, Tory leader George A. Drew {{unexpectedly}} resigned due to ill health. In his place, the PC party {{elected the}} fiery and charismatic Diefenbaker. The Tories ran a campaign centred {{on their new}} leader, who attracted large crowds to rallies and made a strong impression on television. The Liberals ran a lacklustre campaign, and St. Laurent made few television appearances. Uncomfortable with the medium, the Prime Minister read his speeches from a script and refused to <b>wear</b> <b>makeup.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{aspect of the}} {{production}} is Craig's use of a single, plain set that varied from scene to scene by means of large, abstract screens that altered {{the size and shape}} of the acting area. There is a persistent theatrical myth that these screens were impractical and fell over during the first performance. This myth may be traced to a passage in Stanislavski's My Life in Art (1924); Craig demanded that Stanislavski delete the story and Stanislavski admitted that the incident occurred only during a rehearsal. He eventually provided Craig with a sworn statement that the mishap was due to an error by the stage-hands and not the design of Craig's screens. The screens had been built ten feet taller than Craig's designs specified, which may have also contributed to the mishap. Craig had envisaged specially costumed, visible stage-hands to move the screens, but Stanislavski had rejected the idea. This forced a curtain close and delay between scenes, which disrupted the sense of fluidity and movement inherent to Craig's conception. The different arrangements of the screens for each scene were used to provide a spatial representation of Hamlet's state of mind or to underline a dramaturgical progression across a sequence of scenes, as visual elements were retained or transformed. In terms of costume design there were also differences between the two artists. For example, in the scene containing the dumb show Craig wished for the Actors to wear oversized masks, but Stanislavski despised this idea as it did not ring true to a realistic style of acting. Eventually there was a compromise which allowed the actors to <b>wear</b> <b>makeup</b> along with extravagant beards and wigs (Innes 158).|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{there are}} no federal laws prohibiting {{discrimination}} against employees based on their sexual orientation.

If a small business owner owns his or her business {{in a state where}} there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those [...] "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech.
