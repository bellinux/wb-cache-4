500|$|Richard Brody of The New Yorker {{notes the}} film's [...] "Eurocentric art-house self-awareness" [...] and Alvy Singer's [...] "psychoanalytic {{obsession}} in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions". Annie Hall {{is viewed as}} the definitive Woody Allen film in displaying neurotic humor. Singer is identified with the stereotypical neurotic Jewish male, and the differences between Alvy and Annie are often related to the perceptions and realities of Jewish identity. Vincent Brook notes that [...] "Alvy dines with the WASP-y Hall family and imagines that they must {{see him as a}} Hasidic Jew, complete with payess (ear locks) and a large black hat." [...] Robert M. Seltzer and Norman J. Cohen highlight the scene in which Annie remarks that Annie's grandmother [...] "hates Jews. She thinks they just make money, but she’s the one. Is she ever, I’m telling you.", revealing the hypocrisy in her grandmother's stereotypical American view of Jews by arguing that [...] "no stigma attaches to the love of money in America". Bernd Herzogenrath also considers Allen's joke, [...] "I would like to but <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> eggs", to the doctor at the end when he suggests putting him in a mental institution, to be a paradox of not only the persona of the urban neurotic Jew but also of the film itself.|$|E
500|$|While {{critical}} reviews were mixed, {{the game}} proved popular with players. The game's alpha footage, {{as well as}} Let's Play videos on pre-release copies such as that from PewDiePie, drew {{a great deal of}} demand for the game prior to release. Ibrisagic stated that Coffee Stain Studios made their money back on the development costs within a few minutes of the game being offered on Steam. As of August 2014, the studio has reported that nearly a million copies of Goat Simulator have been sold, outperforming their other games over the previous four years. The mobile release for iOS and Android systems reached 100,000 downloads within 6 days of launch. By mid-January 2015, over 2.5 million copies of the game were sold across all platforms. During a presentation at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, Ibrisagic revealed that Goat Simulator has made more than $12 million in revenue, compared to both Sanctum and Sanctum 2 which made under $2 million each. Goat Simulator was seen as a disruptive title in contrast to typical AAA titles; Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester felt they needed to publish more games like Goat Simulator, stating [...] "You have to have an edge in there, and that's why I say 'more Goat Simulator and less Call of Duty' for Paradox, because <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> edge. It's easier to get out and market, it's easier to show what you're doing" [...] adding that [...] "People are tired of explosions and dubstep music. We've seen it a million times now".|$|E
500|$|In early April, the {{new leader}} of the Swedish Social Democrats, Håkan Juholt, visited Finland {{in order to show}} support for the SDP in the election. The party also invited other foreign {{politicians}} and ministers for a campaign rally in the week before the election. Liisa Jaakonsaari, an SDP MEP, justified this by saying that it was a tradition to invite colleagues from other states. The party's main guest was the German chairman of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament Martin Schulz. In the interim, the party also invited Swedish Social Democrat Marita Ulvskog who echoed the view that [...] "investors and banks need to take responsibility." [...] Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen was also present; he praised the EU and EMU and said that Finland is in a [...] "psychological and moral slump." [...] Following a recent election of his own, the leader of the Estonian Social Democratic Party Sven Mikser and MEP Ivari Padar traveled to campaign rallies in Helsinki and Espoo on 11 April to show support for their [...] "sister party's field campaign." [...] Mikser said that the [...] "Social Democrats recently garnered a strong vote in Estonia and are clearly on the rise. Now <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> same to happen in Finland." [...] Padar also said that because of the rise of anti-EU parties in both Finland and other countries: [...] "That is why I personally consider it important to explain to the Finnish people that Europe should not be feared. Since Estonia and Finland are the only Nordic countries in the Eurozone, we need to have [...] strong partnership in the region." ...|$|E
