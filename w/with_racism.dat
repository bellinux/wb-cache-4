It was there that she met MalcolmX and, in 1956, joined the Nation of Islam. The couple married in 1958.|$|E

In 1947, the organization was granted non-governmental organizational (NGO) status and, for many years, was the only Jewish organization with full-time representation at the United Nations. It is credited with a leading role in the U.N. reversal of its 1975 resolution equating Zionism <b>with</b> <b>racism.</b>|$|E
25|$|While Cutten's legacy {{has been}} substantively marred by the espousal {{of what many}} {{consider}} to be racist vitriol, the contributions he made to developing the prestige and facilities of Colgate were significant. Because of this ambiguity, the controversy around Cutten became emblematic of the division surrounding how modern American universities should broker their own history <b>with</b> <b>racism,</b> foreshadowing future controversies in the mid-2010s at universities such as Yale University and Harvard University.|$|E

Ferguson's mother died from cancer soon afterward. The deaths destroyed the family's fortunes. Family friends said this deeply disturbed Ferguson; he moved to the United States in 1982 on a visitor's visa. His friends supposed that he had trouble dealing <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> in America and that he felt frustrated because he couldn't find work outside of menial jobs.|$|E
25|$|Griffin's first short play, Killjoy, {{was written}} for Theatre West Glamorgan (subsequently renamed Teatr na n'Og) and was first {{performed}} in 1993. Two more short plays, The Change and A Generation Arises, were performed in 1994. In 1997, Griffin collaborated with Jo Brand on a short play, Mental, {{which was based on}} their shared experiences as psychiatric nurses; the two performed an updated version at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Griffin's first full-length play, Flesh and Blood, which deals <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> in Welsh society, debuted at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff in 2000, and later moved to the Hampstead Theatre in London. In 2002, Teatr y Byd in Newport debuted another play by Griffin, I Love You Superstar.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Garcia's mother married Wally Matusiewicz. Subsequently, Garcia and {{his brother}} moved back home with their mother and new stepfather. However, due to the {{roughneck}} reputation of their neighborhood at the time, the Excelsior District, Garcia's mother moved their family to Menlo Park. During their stay in Menlo Park, Garcia became acquainted <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> and antisemitism, things he disliked intensely. The same year, Garcia was also introduced to rock and roll and rhythm and blues by his brother, and enjoyed listening {{to the likes of}} Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, B. B. King, Hank Ballard, and, later, Chuck Berry. Clifford often memorized the vocals for his favorite songs, and would then make Garcia learn the harmony parts, a move to which Garcia later attributed much of his early ear training.|$|E

25|$|The Springbok was {{regarded}} as representing both the exclusion of players who were not designated white under apartheid legislation and, by extension, of apartheid itself. Although the Springbok was adopted briefly by the first coloured national rugby team in 1939 and by their first black counterparts in 1950, it became exclusively associated with segregated sporting codes afterwards. South African rugby officials in particular, and the national rugby team itself, have an historical association <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> from 1906 on. The first rugby Springboks initially refused to play against a Devon side that included Jimmy Peters, the first black player to represent England. Legendary official, national coach, and Springbok scrumhalf Danie Craven had acquiesced with government officials who had demanded that Māori players be excluded from visiting All Black teams. Craven had also indicated that the Springbok was exclusively tied to the white identity of the national rugby team.|$|E
25|$|Language, {{linguistics}} {{and discourse}} are active {{areas of study}} in the humanities, along with literature and the arts. Discourse analysis seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study {{of the ways in}} which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. Van Dijk (1992), for example, examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims. He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, The Souls of Black Folk by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early African-American literature that describes the author's experiences <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> when he was traveling in the South as an African American.|$|E

Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and crippled uncle (Uncle Willie) in Stamps, Arkansas. Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents' abandonment throughout the book – they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.|$|E

[...] Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said in 2015 [...] "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> in its past".|$|E
500|$|Motley {{and fellow}} black {{teammate}} Bill Willis contended <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> throughout their careers.

[...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them," [...] Motley once said. [...] "So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." [...] Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{insists that}} Angelou's {{treatment}} of racism {{is what gives}} her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. For example, in Angelou's depiction of the [...] "powhitetrash" [...] incident, Maya reacts with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness, but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing <b>with</b> <b>racism,</b> {{and that it is}} an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism. Walker calls Momma's way a [...] "strategy of subtle resistance" [...] and McPherson calls it [...] "the dignified course of silent endurance".|$|E

500|$|Despite these findings, {{baseball}} historians still credit Walker {{with being}} {{the first in the}} major leagues to play openly as a black man. On the subject of White, John R. Husman wrote: [...] "He played baseball and lived his life as a white man. If White, who was also of white blood, said he was white and he was not challenged, he was white in his time and circumstances". To clear up the confusion between Walker and Robinson, Husman also pointed out that, while the two ball players endured their own trials <b>with</b> <b>racism</b> in baseball, Walker undoubtedly preceded Robinson in the major leagues.|$|E
