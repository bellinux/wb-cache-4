6000|$|... "What can we do?" [...] said Marie; [...] "you know we don't want to hinder, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you. It {{was so good}} of you to let us come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you, {{and we can}} settle about blame by and by," [...] whispered Merry with a kiss; for she adored dashing Jill, {{and never}} would own that she did wrong.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was hoping}} it would {{get us out of}} the {{projects}} and into a positive way of life. And <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> other people get out of this poverty" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{action of}} the United States was viewed with {{suspicion}} by Spain. The people of that country were certain <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Cuba only in order to [...] "gobble her up afterward," [...] as the saying went. Such was not our intention at all, and total Cuban liberty to-day testifies to that fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} we are {{thinking}} of, Christine. We have only been waiting till my arm was out of a sling, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we don't," [...] she said, [...] "not {{those of}} us who think. We know we shall never oust man from his place. He will always be the greater. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him; that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] he answered, [...] "and I, are {{attached}} to none of the recognized denominations. Our only object {{is to try to}} keep alight in our fellow-creatures the flame of spirituality. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them--not to forget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I mean! To a {{salesman}} with {{a love for}} his profession, it's hard problems like that that inspire him to do his best. Besides, Stan--Matter o' fact, Thompson and I are against bonuses, {{as a matter of}} principle. We like you, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you so you can get married, but we can't be unfair to the others on the staff. If we start giving you bonuses, don't you see we're going to hurt the feeling and be unjust to Penniman and Laylock? Right's right, and discrimination is unfair, and there ain't going to be any of it in this office! Don't get the idea, Stan, that because during the war salesmen were hard to hire, now, when there's a lot of men out of work, there aren't a slew of bright young fellows that would be glad to step in and enjoy your opportunities, and not act as if Thompson and I were his enemies and not do any work except for bonuses. How about it, heh? How about it?" ...|$|E
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> {{solving the}} {{problems}} we meet every day, and through this research we did. Research was done on population of boxers 15 - 19 years old, who compete in Serbian Youth League. We keep being asked: “How big is the morphological characteristics influence on a boxer`s success? While selecting boys for boxing, on which morphological characteristics we need to pay our attention most?” Based on results we got in this research, boys must have a good relation of height and weight, and relatively long legs and arms...|$|R
40|$|Promoting {{self care}} for {{children}} with acute viral illness {{is an opportunity for}} relieving pressure on primary care. Carers may return for a second consultation and expect antibiotic treatment if they are not given a clear idea of what to expect or if their child fails to recover as predicted. 1 We therefore set out to describe the clinical course of suspected acute viral infection of the upper respiratory tract in children who consult their general practitioner. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> clinicians <b>to</b> better predict the course of the condition...|$|R

[...] "I made {{up a lot of}} extra good fudge this {{afternoon}} and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> someone <b>to</b> <b>help</b> us eat it--before the fire--while we tell stories. Perhaps Captain Jim will drop in, too. This is his night." ...|$|R

5000|$|On Tuesday, March 18, {{the secret}} police finally {{revealed}} to Hottelet why he was being held, [...] "suspicion of espionage," [...] they told him. The police, he wrote, were very friendly, [...] "we are your friends and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you," [...] they told him.|$|E
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them, but {{the problem}} is the Ukrainian law, the tabor is beyond the village, we first need to include them in the {{cadaster}} (…) this the well would need a geological investigation as well and involve much bureaucracy. The paper work would be greater than the work itself, and precludes us from even starting such a project.|$|E
40|$|This podcast {{tells the}} story of Bill Mirabella, a Cedar Rapids native, was a D. J., father, friend and fiance, who took his own life in 2011 after a lifelong battle with depression. Our project aims {{to tell the story of}} Bill Mirabella, who died by suicide in 2011. His fiance, Haley was on the scene moments after he died, {{therefore}} she is the only person who truly knows what happened. Bill’s parents have had a hard time coping with his death. They have avoided the word suicide, and talking about Bill’s death. Because of this, some people still don’t truly know what happened <b>to</b> him. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Haley get she, Bill, and her son, George’s story out to the public, in hopes to save a life...|$|R

5000|$|From the deepest, honest convictions, we {{admit to}} the world the legal {{obligation}} to pay Wiedergutmachung for injuries, which the German people have committed through Hitlerism.

5000|$|.....We {{would agree}} to have our help channeled through some {{international}} organization... <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the people. We have no quarrel with the people. They are our people. Our quarrel is with the Communist officials... (Peiping was handling the relief) in a typical Communist way, not in a typical Chinese way...

5000|$|Johnson led a businessman's {{parade in}} Jackson and was beaten during that {{peaceful}} demonstration. Johnson recalled: [...] "It {{was during this}} demonstration that this white man who struck me said, 'You cannot walk on our street.' We have heard them say, 'My state.' We want to say, 'Our state.' We have fought for it, we have bled for it, we are concerned, our children our in it, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E

60|$|RENCH. I didn't mean {{no disrespect}} to him. He don't go 'round preachin', like some fellers I could mention, but actions is louder than words. Ain't {{that the reason}} we're here, because he sympathizes with us and thinks we're {{entitled}} to {{a little more of}} this freedom that's bein' handed 'round? <b>We</b> <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> us, doctor.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in March 2012, Stickam {{launched}} {{a program that}} would allow users to purchase advertising space that would run during their broadcasts on-screen.

The project set out its mission statement: “We want to explore {{what it means for}} a museum to be entrepreneurial, we want to showcase museums already being entrepreneurial, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> more museums be more entrepreneurial more of the time”.

5000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> {{societies}} {{our first}} {{job is to}} listen, rather than to dictate what we think they need, and we {{must be prepared to}} be surprised. This is not just to do with remote tribal peoples: it's of vital relevance to all in a world where ideas of multiculturalism are misunderstood and under attack and where some increasingly want to force their views on others."

5000|$|Vikings {{chairman}} Steve O'Connor said: [...] "Nearly {{everyone knows}} {{someone who has}} been affected by cancer. Unfortunately among men it is still a problem we don't like to talk about. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> raise awareness of the symptoms - and how to get help - and also help to raise money for such an important cause. We have chosen the Halifax game because we are expecting a big crowd so we can make a significant donation to Everyman".|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} present the {{original}} topography of Thermopylae as accurately as possible and to recreate the combat experience, Mechanism shot people on greenscreen and placed them into various CG environments such as the Pass of Thermopylae, Athens, water, and more. Mechanism Digital employed 12 seats of After Effects in an assembly line fashion. They first broke up the edit into individual clips, {{some of which were}} only a couple of seconds long. Then they keyed the background greenscreen. Next, they replaced the background from a library of approved color palates for each location."Each palate had been applied with a Magic Bullet preset and then adjusted to further refine the look. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> people know visually where the scene was taking place and whether they were looking North to South or South to North. Once the palates were completed they were motion tracked (if necessary) and then sent to the render farm. After which, the converted frame sequences were sent compiled into movies," [...] said Lucien Harriot.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2013, {{the family}} of the victim {{established}} the Nirbhaya Trust, an institute formed to assist women who have experienced violence to find shelter and legal assistance. Due to the fact that Indian laws do not allow the publishing of a rape victim's name, it was named Nirbhaya which means fearless in Hindi, after the name used by the media. The victim's father stated, [...] "So many people supported us, so ... <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> those girls who have no one." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sarkozy's use of {{the word}} led to it {{becoming}} a verb: [...] "to Karcher" [...] or [...] "Karcherize". Presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen told residents of Argenteuil, many of them immigrants, [...] "If some want to Karcherize you, to exclude you, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you get out of these ghettos." [...] As a response, Kärcher France sent a letter to all of the candidates in the 2007 presidential election asking them not to use the company's name this way, and has run ads in newspapers disassociating itself from the remarks.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the initial}} {{experimental}} period, Google released {{it to the}} public on February 17, 2010, as an open source code. [...] According to Neha Singh, software engineer for Google, [...] "Open sourcing the code was the logical next stage of the experiment and was always planned. From the beginning, we had said that hosting the stories on Google Labs was temporary. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> interested news publishers cover stories this way on their own websites. The Times and Post had teams of reporters publishing through the Living Stories format for over two months, which helped us collect a lot of data and feedback, and improve the code." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{foundation}} has drawn {{criticism in the}} past over its use of money raised. As of fiscal year 2014, {{the most recent year}} for which data is available, the organization spent 7.2% of its revenue on program expenses, 9.9% on administrative expenses, and 82.7% on fundraising. In comparison, the BBB considers spending more than 35% on total overhead (administrative and fundraising expenses combined) excessive. The Tampa Bay Times has ranked Wishing Well Foundation USA #28 on its 2014 list of [...] "America's Worst Charities". When the Tampa Bay Times requested comments from the foundation, the organization claimed, [...] "We have tried in the past to operate without fundraiser assistance, but we could not grant the wishes of the children <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> without fundraiser assistance." [...] In a written message, LeBeau said, [...] "What you are referring to as 'fundraising' also includes several components necessary to the successful operation of the charity, including providing public awareness of the charity's functions so that those in need of its services are {{able to take advantage of}} the services offered." [...] The {{foundation has}} not filed a voluntary charity report with the BBB.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE/AIM: Our goals are, beyond {{theory of}} PCT many times described, {{to review the}} main {{patterns}} resulting from PCT processing and to show the way to interpret them. We will also discuss the "green-red" penumbra/infarct maps, output of our analysis software; show the related potential pitfalls {{and the influence of}} various parameters on the result. CONTENT ORGANIZATION: Cases will be presented in a quiz format: 1) Classic cases of PCT: a) MCA, ACA and PCA acute ischemia. b) Pitfalls resulting from other conditions such as CIA stenosis, luxury perfusion and older infarct. 2) Other conditions with currently little evidence, but useful to keep in mind in order to avoid misreading of the PCT maps. 3) Through all the cases, emphasize will be given on the automatic rendered penumbra/infarct maps and their use and limitations in acute ischemia interpretation. SUMMARY: PCT in acute stroke has now entered common practice in emergency imaging. If the analysis of MTT, CBF, CBV maps is often easy with clear patterns, some external conditions may however complicate their interpretation. By reviewing classic and less classic -but not infrequent- cases, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> radiologists <b>to</b> solve the majority of cases they will face in their daily practice, and to clearly depict what they can now expect from automatic rendered penumbra/infarct maps...|$|R
