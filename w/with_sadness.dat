5|$|In 2002, Takahashi began {{publishing}} , a prequel to Ginga Legend Weed and Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin. It {{was originally}} serialized in the Weed World(ウィードWORLD), published by Nihon Bungeisha, between March31,2002 and December10,2002. In March 2003, Nihon Bungeisha released the collected chapters {{in a single}} book and in December2005, it {{was included in the}} omnibus Ginga Densetsu Weed Tokubetsu Han with Weed Gaiden.

5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled <b>with</b> <b>sadness,</b> the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle <b>with</b> <b>Sadness,</b> deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E

5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated <b>with</b> <b>sadness</b> and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E
25|$|The Late Tang {{poetry of}} Du Mu's type tended toward a clear, robust style, often looking back upon the past <b>with</b> <b>sadness,</b> perhaps {{reflecting}} the times. The Tang dynasty was falling apart, {{it was still}} in existence, but obviously in a state of decline.|$|E

When she arrives with her daughters, Edvard takes the latter to do some shopping.|$|E
50|$|Being {{attentive}} to, {{and patient}} <b>with,</b> one's <b>sadness</b> {{may also be}} a way for people to learn through solitude; while emotional support to help people stay <b>with</b> their <b>sadness</b> can be further helpful. Such an approach is fueled by the underlying belief that loss (when felt wholeheartedly) can lead to a new sense of aliveness, and to a re-engagement with the outside world.|$|R

25|$|Surveys in the US and Europe {{show that}} blue is the colour most {{commonly}} associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sometimes <b>with</b> <b>sadness.</b> In US and European public opinion polls {{it is the most}} popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour. The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.|$|E
25|$|That fall, Addams, {{her sister}} Alice, Alice's husband Harry, and their stepmother, Anna Haldeman Addams, moved to Philadelphia {{so that the}} three young people could pursue medical educations. Harry was already trained in {{medicine}} and did further studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Jane and Alice completed {{their first year of}} medical school at the Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia, but Jane's health problems, a spinal operation and a nervous breakdown, prevented her from completing the degree. She was filled <b>with</b> <b>sadness</b> at her failure. Stepmother Anna was also ill, so the entire family canceled their plans to stay two years and returned to Cedarville.|$|E

25|$|Axel Martin Fredrik Munthe (31 October 1857 – 11 February 1949) was a Swedish-born {{physician}} and psychiatrist, {{best known as}} the author of The Story of San Michele, an autobiographical account of his life and work. He spoke several languages (Swedish, English, French, Italian fluently, and German at least passably), grew up in Sweden, attended medical school there, and opened his first practice in France. He was married to an English aristocrat and spent most of his adult life in Italy. His philanthropic nature often led him to treat the poor without charge, and he risked his life on several occasions to offer medical help in times of war, disaster, or plague. As an advocate of animal rights, he purchased land to create a bird sanctuary near his home in Italy, argued for bans on painful traps, and himself kept pets as diverse as an owl and a baboon, as well as many types of dog. His writing is light-hearted, being primarily memoirs drawn from his real-life experiences, but it is often tinged <b>with</b> <b>sadness</b> or tragedy, and often uses dramatic licence. He primarily wrote about people and their idiosyncrasies, portraying the foibles of both the rich and the poor, but also about animals.|$|E
25|$|From {{the night}} of the event, Alexander I was {{suffering}} from high fever: his wound had become infected and soon developed into septicaemia. With the rapid evolution of his illness, doctors planned to amputate his leg but no one wanted to take responsibility for such an act. Operated seven times, he was cared for only by Aspasia during the four weeks which lasted his agony. Under the effect of the blood poisoning, the young King suffered terribly and his cries of pain were heard in the entire Royal Palace. On 19 October he became delirious and called out for his mother. However, the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to re-enter the country. In St. Moritz, where she was exiled {{with the rest of the}} royal family, the Queen begged the Hellenic authorities to let her take care of her son but Venizelos remained adamant. Finally, Dowager Queen Olga, widow of George I, was allowed to travel alone to Athens to be with her grandson. But delayed by rough seas, she arrived two hours after the King's death, on 25 October 1920. Informed by telegram that night, other members of the royal family learned of the death <b>with</b> <b>sadness.</b>|$|E

500|$|By {{the first}} week of July, Harrison was in a Los Angeles studio {{recording}} his purpose-written song, [...] "Bangla Desh", with co-producer Phil Spector. The song's opening verse documents Shankar's plea to Harrison for assistance, and the lyrics [...] "My friend came to me <b>with</b> <b>sadness</b> in his eyes / Told me that he wanted help before his country dies" [...] provided an enduring image for what United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan later recognised as the basic human aspect behind the cause.|$|E
500|$|Akhmatova {{joined the}} Acmeist group of poets in 1910 with poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky, working in {{response}} to the Symbolist school, concurrent with the growth of Imagism in Europe and America. It promoted the use of craft and rigorous poetic form over mysticism or spiritual in-roads to composition, favouring the concrete over the ephemeral. Akhmatova modeled its principles of writing with clarity, simplicity, and disciplined form. Her first collections [...] Evening (1912) and Rosary (1914) received wide critical acclaim and made her famous from the start of her career. They contained brief, psychologically taut pieces, acclaimed for their classical diction, telling details, and the skilful use of colour. Evening and her next four books were mostly lyric miniatures on the theme of love, shot through <b>with</b> <b>sadness.</b>|$|E
500|$|At 5:30a.m., {{a detective}} {{arrived from the}} fire scene to advise those {{at the police station}} that Tim and Kelly Farrar had been found dead in the home. Green {{initially}} reacted <b>with</b> <b>sadness</b> that quickly changed to anger. She shouted at detectives, claiming that firefighters had not done enough to save the children. Where previously she had been cooperative and friendly with the detectives interviewing her, she now began to attack them verbally, calling investigators and their methods [...] "pathetic", alleging that they had withheld from her knowledge of the children's deaths, and demanding to be allowed to see Farrar and the remains of the family's house. Though Green stressed to police that she wanted {{to be the one to}} [...] "tell my husband our babies are dead," [...] her request was not granted.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the author}} most {{affected}} by Balzac was American expatriate novelist Henry James. In 1878 James wrote <b>with</b> <b>sadness</b> {{about the lack of}} contemporary attention paid to Balzac, and lavished praise on him in four essays (in 1875, 1877, 1902, and 1913). In 1878 James wrote: [...] "Large as Balzac is, he is all of one piece and he hangs perfectly together". He wrote with admiration of Balzac's attempt to portray in writing [...] "a beast with a hundred claws". In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac—a conscious style preference; he stated: [...] "the artist of the Comédie Humaine is half smothered by the historian". Still, both authors used the form of the realist novel to probe the machinations of society and the myriad motives of human behavior.|$|E
500|$|Welles {{said that}} the Boar's Head Tavern was the only full set built for the film, and the other sets were simply dressed or {{decorated}} on location. Welles stated that he designed, painted and blow-torched the set, and designed all of the film's costumes. Early in pre-production Welles was approached by Anthony Perkins to play Prince Hal, but Welles had already promised the role to Keith Baxter. Hilton Edwards was initially cast as Justice Silence, but was replaced after he became ill. The title Chimes at Midnight derives from Henry IV, Part 2, where in response to Justice Shallow's reminiscing of their long-past school days, Falstaff states: [...] "We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow". Welles scholar Bridget Gellert Lyons {{said that the}} film's title, [...] "which is given further resonance by the repeated intoning of bells throughout the film, is associated for the audience <b>with</b> <b>sadness</b> and mortality more than youthful carousal." ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{version of}} the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as {{it seemed to be}} the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an {{evaluation}} screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film. While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all. He soon reached a breakthrough: that emotions are meant to connect people together, and that relationships are the most important things in life. He decided to replace Fear <b>with</b> <b>Sadness,</b> which he felt is crucial to renewal. He met with Rivera and Del Carmen that night to explain his change of plans, and to his surprise, they reacted positively to it. At the screening, he informed his superiors that new plans for the film were in order. Although it was a [...] "scary moment", the film remained in production.|$|E
