Pandawa Agung is {{a company}} engaged in the {{manufacture}} of paint making, the resulting product is the basic paint of the wall, roof tile paint, wood and iron paint, basic iron paint, wood base paint, and industrial base paint. One of the problems being faced by CV. Pandawa Agung is being in a <b>warehouse</b> <b>of</b> finished <b>goods.</b> It’s known that the location of the nearest placement of the input or output point is occupied by finished goods P. Lite. However it’s known that the displacement frequency of P. Lite is very small when compared to the frequency <b>of</b> the finished <b>goods</b> P. Standard and WS (Weather Shield). This kind of layout becomes the cause of distant travel distances, the location <b>of</b> fast moving <b>goods</b> placement far from the entrance or exit that causes the operational costs of material handling to be high and the time of the transfer of the old. The purpose of the study this final project is to define and design a layout proposal (Re-layout) in resolving the problems being faced by CV. Pandawa Agung. By improving the layout <b>of</b> the finished <b>goods</b> <b>warehouse</b> in CV. Pandawa Agung so it can produce a layout that has a distance criteria and material handling tools are optimal and in accordance with the conditions in the <b>warehouse</b> <b>of</b> finished <b>goods.</b> Processing <b>of</b> the data that will be used is by using Class Based Storage Policy. Class Method Based Storage Policy is the retention policy by dividing into three classes: class A, B, and C. The policy is also based on Pareto Law. Class-Based Storage Policy is a method that makes setting up and arrangement of storage become more flexible. Designing the layout of the proposed method Class Storage Based Policy starts from the comparing material handling tools used are trolley and hand pallet, then from both tools selected one {{to be used in the}} <b>warehouse</b> <b>of</b> finished <b>goods.</b> Then grouping types <b>of</b> finished <b>goods</b> into three classes can be conducted with respect to the percentage of absorption of funds, create a layout design taking into account the closeness <b>of</b> the finished <b>goods</b> with the entrance and exit in accordance with the class, calculates the distance between the blocks of rectilinear and calculates total material handling cost. With the preparation of the draft storage methods Storage Policy-Based Class is expected to finished goods storage space will occupy more serious with finished goods shortest distance moving and material handling costs are small. So in this study we can conclude that the distance moved by the finished goods become 394 m in 2 weeks and the cost of material handling every meter becomes Rp. 1, 288. 25 with total material handling cost becomes Rp. 507, 570. 5 in 2 weeks.

40|$|Background: Companies {{have often}} relinquished {{the control of}} {{important}} business functions to outside suppliers {{for the sake of}} short-term savings and {{because of the lack of}} use of proper decision-making methods within the business. Objectives: This article identified three methods of decision-making and applied it to a logistics outsourcing problem. The logistics outsourcing problem consisted of a make-or-buy decision as well as a supplier selection process. The purpose of the study was to determine the most suitable method in the case of logistics outsourcing. Method: The decision-making methods were applied to a South African case study within the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. The logistics functions considered in the case study included secondary distribution and <b>warehousing</b> <b>of</b> finished <b>goods.</b> Each method considered the same evaluation criteria and the results were analysed and compared. Results: Each method produced different results to the logistics outsourcing problem. The method developed by Platts, Probert and Canez (2000) suggested that the logistics functions be insourced. The decision tree method suggested outsourcing both functions, with a unit rate cost model. The results from the linear programming (LP) method indicated that the secondary distribution function should be insourced and the warehousing function outsourced, with a fixed and variable cost model pending further analysis of the demand trends. Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence that proven outsourcing decision-making methods, such as the method developed by Platts et al. (2000), the LP method and the decision tree method traditionally applied to a manufacturing outsourcing decision problem, can be adapted and applied to a logistics outsourcing decision problem of a South African FMCG company. </div...|$|R
