40|$|Purpose – This paper {{investigates the}} motivational factors behind the {{transition}} of successful hospitality entrepreneurs back to paid employment. The study focuses on small business owners {{because the majority of}} the New Zealand hospitality industry is represented by small to medium businesses. Methodology – Qualitative methods were employed to understand the reasons for the transition from entrepreneurship to paid employment. Data were collected through sixteen interviews, and analysed using narrative analysis to examine participants’ stories. Findings – Motivational factors were categorised into ten themes: family, work-life imbalance, health and stress, age, planned exit, security and stability of paid employment, education, expectations of others, lack of development, and intuition. Although a combination of motivational factors was expressed by all participants, work-life imbalance was identifed as a consistence influence on decisions to exit entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications – Research is relatively sparse on the reasons for returning to paid employment from successful hospitality entrepreneurship, so this study provides a new understanding of this phenomenon, as well as the challenges of the <b>work-life</b> <b>balancing</b> issues in entrepreneurship. Although poor <b>work-life</b> <b>balances</b> were self-imposed, the multiple and conflicting expectations of business owners, partners, family, community and customers were identified as contributing influences on exiting owner-operated businesses.

40|$|The article {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} ambiguity work as a specific form of <b>work-life</b> <b>balancing</b> performed when making a livelihood based on leisure interests and a personal lifestyle. The study focuses on female self-employed horse-farmers in Sweden involved in service work with and through horses. Through an analysis of narratives and practices of this service work, based on ethnographic interviews and observations, boundary negotiations of various social spheres are discernible: Work and life, and the commercial and the personal. The analysis shows that the horse-farmers perform a delicate and ongoing balancing act between family interests, individual leisure and paid work. Drawing {{on the notion of}} sociological ambivalence, it is suggested that this balancing act does not strive for demarcations, but rather to stay betwixt-and-between social spheres. It is argued that lifestyle enterprising is enacted and confirmed through ongoing boundary negotiations, or ambiguity work, that sustains a tension between keeping and blurring social boundaries. It is further argued that ambiguity work in this type of lifestyle enterprising both reinforces and questions ideals and norms concerning small business management and professional versus non-professional relationships...|$|R

In order to ensure that Japanese workers are free to lead a healthy and affluent life in a style of their choosing while also maintaining their economic independence, the Gender Equality Bureau in 2007 recommended a variety of policies for both the public and private sector in order to increase time-off for employees. The Bureau has pushed private employers to offer flexible hours that can cater to a variety of lifestyles, such as offering child-care leave for men in order to promote the male's role in child-rearing. Government, per the Bureau's recommendation, is tasked with providing a policy structure that meets both male and female needs, hiring only companies that practice <b>work-life</b> <b>balance</b> for public contracts, and passing legislation that signifies the importance of both genders taking an active role in domestic work.|$|E

Research suggests that when work-family balance practices are introduced they can greatly enhance organisational efficency.

However those that reported a supportive work environment also reported higher levels of organisational commitment, greater job and life satisfaction as well as lower level of work-family conflict and lower intentions to quit.

This study aims to clarify whether sex differences in health functioning {{can be explained by}} sex differences in work and family characteristics. The subjects were 3787 civil servants (2525 men and 1262 women), aged 20 - 65, working in a local government on the west coast of Japan. A questionnaire survey was conducted in January 2003. Low employment grade, high demands, long work hours, shift work, being unmarried, having no young children, high family-to-work conflict and high work-to-family conflict were more common among women than men and were independently associated with poor {{physical and}} mental functioning. The age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of women for poor health functioning were 1. 80 for poor physical functioning and 1. 77 for poor mental functioning. When adjusted for employment grade and work characteristics (control, demand, support, work hours, and shift work), the sex differences in health functioning attenuated. When adjusted for family characteristics (family structure and work-family conflicts), the sex differences in health functioning further attenuated and were no longer statistically significant. Sex differences in family characteristics contributed more to sex difference in mental functioning than sex differences in work characteristics. Japan belongs to conservative welfare regimes. In such countries, men are able to concentrate on their work with relative freedom from their family tasks and responsibilities, whereas women feel difficulties in maintaining their <b>work-life</b> <b>balances.</b> Such sex differences in work- and family-related stresses may contribute to sex difference in health.
