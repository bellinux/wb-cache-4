5|$|Because White did {{not officially}} depart Minnesota {{until the middle}} of his second semester, he was academically ineligible to receive a {{scholarship}} from any Division I school in 2010. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) usually requires a two semester residency for transfers. He transferred to Iowa State prior to using any of his athletic eligibility at Minnesota and applied to the NCAA for a <b>waiver</b> to be eligible to play during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, but the NCAA denied his <b>waiver.</b> Iowa State appealed the decision, but their appeal was denied.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Vermont enacted Green Mountain Care, a {{state-based}} single-payer {{system for}} which they intended to pursue a <b>waiver</b> to implement. In December 2014, Vermont decided not to continue due to high expected costs.|$|E
5|$|Maids' representatives {{said that}} when the <b>waiver</b> was announced, the {{guidelines}} were unclear and had no implementation date. Employers deferred contracts or dismissed workers pending confirmation of the effective date, leaving them in limbo. They protested the uncertainty, demanding an increase in their minimum wage to HK$4,000. Employers reportedly began terminating their helpers' contracts, stoking fears of mass terminations. On 20 July Secretary for Labour and Welfare Matthew Cheung announced that the <b>waiver</b> commencement date would be moved up by one month, and the Immigration Department temporarily relaxed its 14-day re-employment requirement for helpers whose contracts had expired.|$|E

President Bill Clinton also employed <b>waivers</b> to give state's flexibility in Welfare reform. Medicaid <b>waivers</b> have also been used. President Obama used executive <b>waivers</b> in 2015 to lift most sanctions on Iran in return for Iran not pursuing nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|<b>Waivers</b> are {{discussed}} in article 13 of the collective bargaining agreement.Unlike other professional leagues, <b>waivers</b> in the NHL do not always mean an unconditional release if a player clears <b>waivers</b> and elects free agency, unless the <b>waivers</b> requested were unconditional <b>waivers.</b> Most NHL players will need to clear <b>waivers</b> before they are assigned to a minor league team; exceptions are listed below. Clearing <b>waivers</b> means every other team in the NHL has the option to 'claim' that player off of the 'waiver wire', thus assuming his contract (and cap hit; this varies for re-entry <b>waivers),</b> and providing only minor monetary compensation to the originating team (unless the <b>waivers</b> requested were re-entry waivers); financial compensations are listed below. If a player clears <b>waivers,</b> the team {{has the right to}} either loan the player to a minor league affiliate which is generally a team in the AHL, or the team can elect to keep that player with their club. Once a player has cleared <b>waivers,</b> they do not need to again clear them for the shorter of: 1. 30 cumulative days on the NHL roster, or 2. Until they have played in 10 NHL games. If a player refuses to report to the minors, the team can use that as grounds to suspend the player (i.e. not pay them).|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit {{applications}} to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all applications submitted. Offices opened one hour earlier than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the <b>waiver</b> rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the <b>waiver</b> would teach households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{lawsuit was}} filed by a South Carolina {{resident}} {{who said he}} was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown Columbia, with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal <b>waiver.</b> The lawsuit also sought to have the footage excluded from any DVD releases and removed from Internet video sites.|$|E

5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate {{with the passing}} of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. After review, the FRA <b>waiver</b> was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine additional requirements, including demonstrating minimum crashworthiness, seating, improving grade crossing, meeting FRA positive train control standards in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a safety system program.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} the suspect {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a <b>waiver.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thompkins appealed his {{conviction}} {{on grounds that}} included suppression of his admission—that he had invoked and not waived his right to remain silent—and deficient representation related to improper jury instructions, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Thompkins' Miranda claim.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} popular but disturbing method of misappropriating government revenue in Nigeria is {{the practice of}} granting all manner of indiscriminate <b>waivers</b> of tariffs and duties on imported commodities under the directive of the Presidency. This paper critiques the law, use and abuse of duty <b>waivers</b> in Nigeria. It argues that although the President, {{on the advice of}} the Tariff Council, has powers to grant <b>waivers,</b> such powers are neither supposed to be granted indiscriminately nor in secret. The granting of indiscriminate <b>waivers</b> to individual operators in an industry rather than to the entire industry distorts national economic and industrial development which is normally the very essence of granting such <b>waivers.</b> The paper also raises questions about the implications of the granting of indiscriminate duty <b>waivers</b> by the Presidency for fiscal relationships in a federal state...|$|R

Although she had one more season of college eligibility remaining due to her NCAA medical hardship <b>waiver,</b> she opted to enter the Women's Professional Soccer Draft instead. Rapinoe's 88-point career, including 30 goals and 28 assists, ranks tenth in the school's history despite her playing only 60 games.|$|E
5|$|Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made {{personnel}} {{changes during}} the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, {{but could not}} agree on the terms with any team. They put Pipp on waivers, and he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 <b>waiver</b> price. The Reds, who {{had not had a}} strong starting first baseman since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead. Pipp again attempted to acquire a portion of the purchase price, but was rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Roberts sat on {{an interim}} committee dealing with hospice and palliative care issues, and carried legislation originating from that committee during the 2010 session, including two bills that clarified policies surrounding end-of-life care and advance directives.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the enforceability of appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> {{in terms of}} due process and public policy. The article identifies the applicable standards for determining the enforceability of <b>waivers</b> of federal rights, and then applies those standards to <b>waivers</b> {{of the right to}} appellate review of criminal sentences. The article first examines the due process concerns raised by appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> and concludes that, while appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> should be examined on a case-by-case basis to ensure they are voluntary, deliberate, and informed decisions of the defendant, a per se rule barring their enforceability on due process grounds is not warranted. The article then examines the public policy concerns raised by appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers.</b> Should the parties to a federal criminal action be allowed to 2 ̆ 2 cast their lot 2 ̆ 2 with the trial judge, thus making the trial judge the final arbiter of law and fact with respect to the sentencing decision? How are relevant policy interests, including the purposes underlying the new right to appellate review of sentences, affected by enforcement of appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers?</b> If appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> should be enforced, what limitations should be placed on their enforcement? The article concludes that limited enforcement of appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> is justified. As a general matter, voluntary, deliberate, and informed appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> should be enforced except when enforcement will preclude review of claims that (1) a sentence was imposed in violation of the underlying substantive criminal statute, (2) in imposing sentence the trial judge considered factors that may not lawfully be considered, and (3) the trial judge committed 2 ̆ 2 plain error 2 ̆ 2 in imposing sentence in violation of the Sentencing Reform Act. Finally, the article asks whether an additional need exists for a Guevara-type 2 ̆ 2 mutuality 2 ̆ 2 requirement: Should appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> be enforced when only one party has waived the right to appeal? The article concludes that appeal-of-sentence <b>waivers</b> should not be enforced against either party unless both parties have explicitly waived their right to appeal...|$|R
