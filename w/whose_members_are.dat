40|$|The limited {{literature}} on mood and group creativity provides inconclusive results. Broaden and Build {{theory suggests that}} positive moods may encourage fluency and flexibility of ideas due to broadened thoughts. However, negative moods may be more associated with depth of exploration due to a narrowed focus of attention. Members of three-person groups had positive, neutral, or negative moods induced, performed an unusual uses creativity task, and then answered questions regarding their interaction and performance. Groups <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>were</b> in negative moods often demonstrated more positive group processes (e. g., greater persistence, less distraction) than groups <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>were</b> in neutral moods. Additionally, groups <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>were</b> in positive moods sometimes demonstrated more positive group processes than groups <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>were</b> in neutral moods. ...|$|R

5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{consists}} of two chambers. It makes legislation and is empowered by the constitution to oversee {{the activities of the}} President and the Cabinet. The lower chamber is the Chamber of Deputies, which has 80 members serving five-year terms. Twenty-four of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a joint assembly of local government officials; another three seats are reserved for youth and disabled members; the remaining 53 are elected by universal suffrage under a proportional representation system. Following the 2013 election, there are 51 female deputies, up from 45 in 2008; , Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament. The upper chamber is the 26-seat Senate, <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> selected by a variety of bodies. A mandatory minimum of 30% of the senators are women. Senators serve eight-year terms.

5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum {{was thought}} to be saprotrophic, and has been {{described}} in this manner in both scholarly and popular discussions of the species. However, this classification was the result of its taxonomic history and comparisons with saprotrophic fungi that are not closely related. After its assignment to the Sclerodermatineae, a suborder <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> ectomycorrhizal, its ecological role came into question. In 2007, Andrew Wilson and David Hibbett of Clark University and Eric Hobbie of the University of New Hampshire employed isotopic labeling, DNA sequencing, and morphological analysis to determine that this species is also ectomycorrhizal. Like all mycorrhizal fungi, C.cinnabarinum establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of trees, allowing the fungus to exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of the tree. This association is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. The only host trees identified for C.cinnabarinus are Quercus oaks, although related members of Calostoma have been observed to associate with other trees in the Fagaceae family, such as beech.|$|E

5|$|The work {{caused a}} scandal in contemporary, still-partitioned Poland; it was {{discussed}} even before its unveiling. It offended {{a number of}} society figures, many tracing direct lineage to the major magnate families <b>whose</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> portrayed in the painting as traitors to the Polish cause. There {{were a number of}} critical reviews of the work in the contemporary press, Matejko received anonymous threats, and some aristocrats are said to have considered buying the painting only to destroy it. Some accused him of defeatism, pessimism, exploiting public sentiment over a historical scandal for contemporary publicity; it was thus criticized by notable artists such as Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and Cyprian Norwid. In Paris, a French-Polish aristocrat, Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski, campaigned against including it in an exhibition. The painting, however, quickly garnered supporters, who in turn reproduced modified copies of it, replacing historical figures with major contemporary critics. Responding to the public outcry, Matejko painted a response — a painting titled Judgement on Matejko (Wyrok na Matejkę, 1867), in which he portrayed his execution by some of his most vocal critics.|$|E
