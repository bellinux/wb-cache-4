5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even <b>when</b> <b>done</b> correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E

If any of these ever get out of hand, and there is no legal justification for banning, the Judges simply impose a heavy tax on them, restricting them to only the few very wealthy citizens.|$|E

25|$|Wool may be spun {{before or}} after washing, {{although}} excessive amounts of lanolin may make spinning difficult, especially when using a drop-spindle. Careless washing may cause felting. <b>When</b> <b>done</b> prior to spinning, this often leads to unusable wool fibre. In washing wool the key thing to avoid is too much agitation and fast temperature changes from hot to cold. Generally, washing is done lock by lock in warm water with dish-soap.|$|E

25|$|Artists {{often use}} backmasking of sounds or {{instrumental}} audio to produce interesting sound effects.

25|$|Acupuncture is {{generally}} safe <b>when</b> <b>done</b> by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single-use needles. When properly delivered, {{it has a}} low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner. A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade. The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections. Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, {{it is recommended that}} acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.|$|E
25|$|The coat must be {{stripped}} by hand or a non-cutting knife {{to retain its}} weather-resistant qualities. This does not hurt the dog <b>when</b> <b>done</b> properly. Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut {{with the other hand}} helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest. Never cut the coat – use your fingers or a non-cutting knife. If the coat is clipped, it loses colour and becomes softer, thus losing its weather-resistant characteristics. For the same reason the coat should not be washed too often, as detergents take away the natural skin oils. Most Irish terriers only need washing when dirty.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>done</b> in high productivity, {{press forging}} is more {{economical}} than hammer forging. The operation also creates closer tolerances. In hammer forging {{a lot of}} the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in press forging, the greater percentage of work is used in the work piece. Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit {{to the size of the}} press forging machine. New press forging techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity. By the constraint of oxidation to the outer layers of the part, reduced levels of microcracking occur in the finished part.|$|E

25|$|The {{framework}} {{is a logical}} structure for classifying and organizing the descriptive representations of an enterprise. It is significant to both {{the management of the}} enterprise, and the actors involved in the development of enterprise systems. While there is no order of priority for the columns of the Framework, the top-down order of the rows is significant to the alignment of business concepts and the actual physical enterprise. The level of detail in the Framework is a function of each cell (and not the rows). <b>When</b> <b>done</b> by IT the lower level of focus is on information technology, however it can apply equally to physical material (ball valves, piping, transformers, fuse boxes for example) and the associated physical processes, roles, locations etc. related to those items.|$|E
25|$|Independent twin {{cylinders}}, (Two cylinders {{of about}} the same capacity mounted together {{on the back of}} the diver, each with its own regulator) are unquestionably a redundant gas supply configuration, as there is no possibility of flow from one to the other during the dive. Use of independent twins for bailout requires the diver to ensure that at all times during the dive both cylinders have sufficient gas remaining to ensure a safe ascent, including any decompression that may be required. This requirement is based on the possibility that either of the cylinders may become unusable without warning. This requirement means that the cylinders are usually breathed in turn, and changed before the pressure drops to the critical pressure for that stage of the dive. This system is economical on gas, and highly reliable <b>when</b> <b>done</b> correctly, but relatively heavy on task loading.|$|E
25|$|The same {{as regular}} {{quicksort}} except the pivot {{is replaced by}} a buffer. First, read the M/2 first and last elements into the buffer and sort them. Read the next element from the beginning or end to balance writing. If the next element is less than the least of the buffer, write it to available space at the beginning. If greater than the greatest, write it to the end. Otherwise write the greatest or least of the buffer, and put the next element in the buffer. Keep the maximum lower and minimum upper keys written to avoid resorting middle elements that are in order. <b>When</b> <b>done,</b> write the buffer. Recursively sort the smaller partition, and loop to sort the remaining partition. This is a kind of three-way quicksort in which the middle partition (buffer) represents a sorted subarray of elements that are approximately equal to the pivot.|$|E
