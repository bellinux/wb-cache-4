40|$|Why does {{overfishing}} {{persist in}} the face of regulation?” The author argues that over fishing,a fundamental cause of the crisis facing our oceans, {{is the result of the}} failure of our fishing management agencies (ultimately our politicians and communities) to embrace a small suite of powerful tools (more correctly strategic approaches) which have been developed to account for uncertainty. Broad success in managing fisheries to achieve sustainability goals will only come if these tools are enthusiastically applied. This will not happen until organisational cultures within fishery management agencies undergo a major shift leading to an asset-based biodiversity conservation, rather than resource exploitation, to be placed at the centre of ocean governance. This thesis examines these issues in the context of case studies covering regional, national and provincial (State) fishery management agencies. With the exception of the case study of a regional fishery (the southern ocean krill fishery) all case studies are drawn from Australian experiences. The central recommendation of the thesis is that fishery management agencies, <b>worldwide,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> replaced by biodiversity asset management agencies. ...|$|E

40|$|Dynamics of {{biological}} processes on the deep-sea floor are traditionally {{thought to be}} controlled by vertical sinking of particles from the euphotic zone at a seasonal scale. However, {{little is known about the}} influence of lateral particle transport from continental margins to deep-sea ecosystems. To address this question, we report here how the formation of dense shelf waters and their subsequent downslope cascade, a climate induced phenomenon, affects the population of the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus. We found evidence that strong currents associated with intense cascading events correlates with the disappearance of this species from its fishing grounds, producing a temporary fishery collapse. Despite this initial negative effect, landings increase between 3 and 5 years after these major events, preceded by an increase of juveniles. The transport of particulate organic matter associated with cascading appears to enhance the recruitment of this deep-sea living resource, apparently mitigating the general trend of overexploitation. Because cascade of dense water from continental shelves is a global phenomenon, we anticipate that its influence on deep-sea ecosystems and fisheries <b>worldwide</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> larger than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTuff {{has been}} {{extensively}} used as a building material in volcanically and tectonically active areas over many centuries, despite its inherent low strength. A common and unfortunate secondary hazard accompanying both major volcanic eruptions and tectonic earthquakes is the initiation of catastrophic fires. Here, we report new experimental results {{on the influence of}} high temperatures on the strength of three tuffs that are commonly used for building in the Neapolitan region of Italy. Our results show that a reduction in strength was only observed for one tuff, the other two were unaffected by high temperatures. The cause of this strength discrepancy was found to be a product of the initial mineralogical composition, or, more specifically, the presence of thermally-unstable zeolites within the initial rock matrix. The implications of these data are that, in the event of fire, only the stability of buildings or structures built from tuff containing thermally-unstable zeolites will suffer. Unfortunately, this includes the most widespread dimension stone in Neapolitan architecture. We recommend that this knowledge should be considered during fire hazard mitigation in the Neapolitan area and that other tuffs used in construction <b>worldwide</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tested in a similar way to assess their fire resistance...|$|E

Potentially, adjuvant laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is of value. The {{aim of this study}} was to present long term oncological outcomes of a pilot study on adjuvant HIPEC to reduce development of PMCRC, with systematic review of literature. Long term oncological outcomes of ten patients who underwent laparoscopic HIPEC within eight weeks after resection of primary CRC in the pilot study were retrospectively collected. A systematic search of literature was performed on studies describing the use of HIPEC in patients with CRC at high risk of developing PM. The median follow-up was 54 months (range 49 - 63). All patients were alive at the last follow-up moment and none of them had developed PM. Two patients had developed pulmonary metastases. Systematic review revealed five small cohort studies, including two matched comparisons. Peritoneal recurrences were found in 0 % to 9 % after adjuvant HIPEC, which was 28 % and 43 % in the two control groups, respectively. Disease free and overall survival were significantly higher in favour of HIPEC. Long term follow-up of ten patients included in a pilot study on adjuvant HIPEC revealed no peritoneal recurrences.

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} the use of micro-analytical {{techniques}} to demonstrate the heterogeneous distribution of radionuclides and metals in soils collected at Former Soviet Union mining sites in Central Asia. Based on digital autoradiography, radionuclides were heterogeneously distributed in soil samples collected at the abandoned uranium mining sites Kurday, Kazakhstan, Kadji Sai, Kyrgyzstan and Taboshar, Tajikistan. Using electron microscopy interfaced with X-ray microanalysis submicron - mm-sized radioactive particles and rock fragments with U, As, Se and toxic metals on the surfaces were identified in Kurday and Kadji Sai samples. Employing scanning and tomographic (3 D) synchrotron radiation based micro-X-ray fluorescence (μ-SRXRF) and synchrotron radiation based micro-X-ray diffraction (μ-SRXRD) allowed us to observe the inner structure of the particles without physical sectioning. The distribution of elements in virtual crosssections demonstrated that U and a series of toxic elements were rather heterogeneously distributed also within individual radioactive TENORM particles. Compared to archived data, U in Kadji Sai particles was present as uraninite (U(4) O(9 +y) or UO(2 +x)) or Na-zippeite ((Na(4) (UO(2)) (6) [(OH) (10) (SO(4)) (3) ]· 4 H(2) O), i. e.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The first {{aim of this}} {{workshop}} was {{to define}} pharmacoeconomic concepts and terminology. Pharmacoeconomics {{can be defined as}} the branch of economics that uses cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, cost-minimization, cost-of-illness and cost-utility analyses to compare pharmaceutical products and treatment strategies. Economic evaluations provide healthcare decision-makers with valuable information, allowing optimal allocation of limited resources. However, pharmacoeconomics is based on long-term benefits, whereas physicians are typically forced to seek immediate savings. The second aim was to review pharmacoeconomic studies in the field of onychomycosis and finally to discuss future perspectives. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We discussed current pharmacoeconomic issues on the management of onychomycosis. Consensus was reached on the following issues: * Published pharmacoeconomic studies concerning onychomycosis are flawed. Future studies should be based on internationally validated principles and appropriate models. The fact that costs of different drugs, laboratory examinations and physician visits vary <b>worldwide</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered. Cost-benefit studies are required. * The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations are often considered in countries other than the UK, even when not adapted to the country in question. * Generic drugs might reduce costs, but this depends on their effectiveness (bioavailability). * Sampling requests affect the economic cost (dependent on methodology, which depends on country) and physicians often trust their instincts even when tests are repeatedly negative. * The cost of adverse event management is usually considered to be 10 %; this may be too high for onychomycosis, as treatments are relatively safe without severe side-effects. * Probability of recurrence for each drug should be determined. * Need for disease severity standardization, definition of diagnostic criteria and successful treatment (mycological and clinical cure) ...|$|E

All organs can be affected by complications of HIV/AIDS, including the eye. When sufficient resources are available and widespread antiretroviral resistance does not exist, the four available classes of antiretroviral agents - nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and fusion inhibitors - can be combined to provide {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). For many (not all) patients, HAART converts an inexorably fatal disease into a chronic disease with a fairly good prognosis. Use of HAART often induces partial immune recovery, which has predominantly beneficial effects on ocular complications of AIDS. However, HAART-induced immune recovery sometimes results in immune recovery inflammatory syndromes, such as immune recovery uveitis. Use of HAART is the single most useful intervention for most patients with ocular complications of AIDS. However, specific ocular therapy is also critical to avoid blindness in the early months before immune recovery can occur, or if HAART is unavailable.

40|$|The Ianapera emerald deposit is hosted in the Neoproterozoic Vohibory {{domain of}} {{southern}} Madagascar, within a tightly folded metamorphic sequence of mafic and ultramafic rocks (M-UMR), gneiss, and marble, {{a few kilometers}} north of the major tectonic break known as the Ianapera-Ampanihy Suture. Late-collisional metaluminous to peraluminous felsic intrusions outcrop in the area. Emerald occurs mostly within metasomatic phlogopitite and quartz-tourmaline veins, developed within lenses of M-UMR. Recent work recognized granitic pegmatites {{as the source of}} the emerald-forming fluids, leading to the classification of proximal and distal mineralization styles, based on whether or not pegmatites are associated with the phlogopitite, respectively (Andrianjakavah et al. 2009). Considerations of the chemistry of tourmaline and scapolite associated with emerald and beryl, data from fluid and solid inclusions in these minerals, thermodynamic calculations, and mineral thermobarometric data confirm that Be originated from the pegmatites, transported in a moderately saline aqueous fluid that exsolved at about 600 to 680 degrees C and 4 - 6 kbars. This fluid was enriched in alkali elements, incompatible elements and dissolved sulfur, and produced the proximal mineralization. Migration along fractures caused loss of {{at least part of the}} pegmatitic elements and local mixing with a metamorphic CO 2 -rich fluid, leading to the more distal mineralization at somewhat lower temperatures (520 to 650 degrees C). Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were measured from beryl and emerald; the data corroborate a magmatic-hydrothermal origin for the mineralization and a common source for proximal and distal fluids. The calculated delta O- 18 (H 2 O) of 12. 5 % at 520 degrees C for the distal emerald and the delta D-H 2 O range measured from the channel of the emerald samples fit within the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic range of values defined for peraluminous granitic magmatism.

40|$|Nicholas E ConnorChild Health Research Foundation Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Dhaka, BangladeshBackground: Fetal and {{neonatal}} malnutrition impacts {{the timing}} of the onset of puberty. The timing of puberty onset {{has been shown to be}} a rough indicator of noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk. Recent advances in understanding the various inter-related neurochemical and genetic controls underpinning puberty onset have shed new light on these interesting and important phenomena. These studies have suggested that developmental trajectory is set very early by epigenetic mechanisms that serve to adjust phenotype to environment. Objective: The aims of this article are to review the most recent research into the proximate mechanisms that initiate puberty; to explore how the activation of those mechanisms could be affected by nutritional cues received during fetal and neonatal life; and, finally, to briefly explore the ramifications for public health. Methods: An extensive literature review was performed using PubMed (1950 to September 2010) and Google Scholar (1980 to September 2010) using the search terms &ldquo;puberty onset&rdquo;, &ldquo;perinatal&rdquo;, and &ldquo;neonatal malnutrition&rdquo;. English language, original research, and review articles were examined; pertinent citations from these articles were also assessed. Results: Literature detailing biochemical pathways and evolutionary explanations of human puberty itself led quickly to a noteworthy connection between neonatal malnutrition, puberty onset, and NCD risk. A strong connection was found between maternal malnutrition during critical windows (followed by catch-up growth in childhood) and an accelerated onset of puberty. Children subject to early nutritional insult not only are likely to undergo puberty earlier but also show an increase in their risk of developing NCDs in later life. Several authors have suggested that this relationship may show potential as an early proxy indicator of susceptibility to these types of diseases, which are an increasing concern in both affluent and developing countries. Conclusions: More attention should be paid to fetal and neonatal nutrition and puberty onset if we are to meaningfully curb the troubling growth of NCDs now and in the future. Efforts to improve maternal conditions among vulnerable poor groups as well as more affluent groups <b>worldwide</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> explored, especially among groups undergoing rapid nutritional transition.

The patient exhibited granulomatous uveitis during the recovery phase. Observations: A woman in her thirties developed flu-like symptoms seven days after receiving an influenza vaccination. Approximately 2 weeks later, the patient reported with conjunctival injection, blurred vision, and pain in her left eye. She was examined in our clinic, and the best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 15 OD and 20 / 20 OS. Multiple whitish spots were observed bilaterally in the deep retinal layer along with edema of the left optic disc. Both indocyanine green and fluorescein angiographic findings suggested a diagnosis of APMPPE. Although APMPPE lesions were gradually resolved after one month, keratic precipitates, anterior chamber and vitreous cellular infiltration, iris and angle nodules, and macular edema were observed and were treated with topical steroid eye drops. No systemic disorders including sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and Wegener's granulomatosis were present.

Caliciviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae and Poxviridae were detected by electron microscopy, histology and molecular techniques in vesicular skin lesions, black dots perceptible by the touch, warts and tattoos in several species of odontocetes and mysticetes. Herpesviruses, poxviruses and likely a cutaneous papillomavirus are cetacean specific. Among bacteria, Dermatophilus spp., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Mycobacterium marinum, Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus iniae and Vibrio spp. were isolated from ulcerative dermatitis, pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis, diamond skin disease and slow-healing ulcers and abscesses. Aeremonas spp., Mycobacterium marinum, Pseudomonas spp. and Vibrio spp. are normally present in the marine environment while Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Streptococcus iniae are fish pathogens that may also infect captive dolphins. Most seem to be opportunistic pathogens, exploiting some break-down in the host’s defenses to initiate an infection. Selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through the prophylactic use of antibiotics in aquaculture is suggested to be a growing problem in South America and {{may account for the}} emergence of unusual cutaneous conditions. At least four groups of fungi i. e. Candida albicans, Fusarium spp., Trichophyton spp. and Lacazia loboi cause skin diseases. Candidiasis occurs predominantly in captive odontocetes. The lesions are often localized around the body orifices and may become extensive, granulating and ulcerated. Fusariosis is characterized by firm, erythematous, cutaneous nodules. Trichophyton spp. was isolated from widespread superficial nodules in an Atlantic T. truncates kept in captivity in Japan. Lobomycosis or lacaziosis is distinguished by grayish, whitish to slightly pink, verrucuous lesions, often in pronounced relief that may ulcerate. While initially described only in Tursiops truncates and Sotalia guianensis from the Americas, lobomycosis seems to be expanding to other continents. The role of ballast water in transporting fungi <b>worldwide</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> investigated. Finally, ciliated protozoans, likely Kyaroikeus cetarius, caused invasive dermatitis in small cetaceans from the USA and Korea. The aquatic environment of cetaceans is naturally home to bacteria and fungi but cetacean skin has several mechanisms to impede invasion. Chemical contaminants may affect natural skin barriers and depress the immune system. Wounds and specific viral infection (poxvirus, herpesvirus) may provide routes of entry...|$|E
40|$|This paper surveys {{hundreds}} of published social-science studies of private, hard-core cartels that contain 699 observations of long-run overcharges. The primary {{finding is that}} the median cartel overcharge {{for all types of}} cartels over all time periods is 25 %: 19 % for domestic cartels, 32 % for international cartels, and 31 % for all successful cartels. Thus, international cartels have historically been about 68 % more effective in raising prices than domestic cartels. Cartel overcharges are skewed to the high side, pushing the mean overcharge for all types of cartels over all time periods to 42 %. "Peak" cartel overcharges are typically double those of the long-run averages. These results are generally consistent with the few, more limited, previously published works that survey cartel overcharges. There is no evidence that convicted cartels are markedly less effective than unpunished ones. The results of a second survey of final verdicts in decided U. S. horizontal collusion cases, only three of which were international cartels, show an average median overcharge of 21 % and an average mean overcharge of 30 %. Outside the United States, 62 decisions of competition commissions cited median average overcharges of 25 % and a mean of 47 %. There are three significant policy implications. First, there is a view among some antitrust writers that {{there is little evidence that}} cartels raise prices significantly for a period long enough to justify the height of current U. S. cartel penalties. This survey's results, which are based upon an extraordinarily large amount of data spanning a broad swath of history of all types of private cartels, sharply contradict these views. In fact, the data suggest that U. S. penalties ought to be increased. Mean overcharges are three times as high as the level presumed by the U. S. Sentencing Commission. Surprisingly, bid rigging was no more injurious than other forms of collusion, which suggests that the USSC should amend its Guidelines that currently treat bid rigging more harshly than other forms of collusion. Second, the principal antitrust authorities abroad often base their typical or maximum fines on a 10 % harm presumption. Average fines imposed since 1995 by Canada and the EU on identical cartels have been lower than U. S. government fines, yet overcharges generated by cartels discovered outside the United States are higher than North America-centered cartels. Consequently, anticartel laws and fine-setting practices abroad are in even greater need of strengthening. Third, cartels with multi-continental price effects are the most harmful type. Despite the evident increases in cartel detection rates and the size of monetary fines and penalties in the past decade, a good case can be made that current global anticartel regimes are under-deterring. While the recent worldwide trend towards the intensification of cartel penalties has been desirable, global cartels are more difficult to detect, have less fear from entry of rivals, achieve higher levels of sales and profitability, and systematically receive weaker corporate sanctions than comparable domestic cartels. Antitrust sanctions <b>worldwide</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> higher for global cartels than for other types. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation is {{a widely}} used but much contested concept. This contestation has a large variety of {{dimensions}} and on-going debates. One of the debates focuses on economic globalisation and a rebalancing of {{the relations between the}} private and public sector that is taking place during the last three decades. Neo-liberalism, dominant in the policy agenda of the leading world powers during this period of time, advocates the necessity of privatisation, including privatisation of public services. However, the international outcomes of privatisation policies associated with the promotion of market relations and private investments in the public sector have not been sufficiently examined in empirical research. Although globalisation debates refer to international regulation, competition and the concentration of capital, there is a paucity of detailed empirically focused study on patterns of ownership and what they mean to a changing international order, especially with respect to privatised utilities. The thesis opens up these themes in a focused way, analysing outcomes of water privatisation and electricity privatisation worldwide. It draws on a comprehensive database held by the Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) that enables an empirically based analysis of arguments about the outcomes of utilities' privatisation {{in the light of the}} globalisation debate. The main methodology used as a basis for a critical assessment of theories of globalisation is social network analysis. The thesis is mostly concerned with the international aspects of the privatisation of public utilities. It begins by arguing that the privatisation of public services <b>worldwide</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> located within debates on globalisation. The thesis then presents a reinterpretation of main globalisation trends, specifically the processes related to the internationalisation of public services, as an emerging modern form of economic colonialism. To develop this argument the thesis comprises a variety of dimensions. First, three sets of debates are reviewed, globalisation, the internationalisation of capital and colonialism. In the course of this analysis attention is drawn to the concentration of economic power and the international dominance of three economic blocs - the North America, Western Europe and Japan. The second dimension of the thesis is the presentation of an analytic framework to analyse the recent developments of privatisation worldwide. Drawing on the achievements of social network analysis a methodology for examining the outcomes of privatisation in relation to ownership and the patterns of concentration that have emerged is developed. This part of the thesis transforms the research questions that arise from the examination of debates about globalisation and privatisation and related developments. Here a set of hypotheses is developed to examine the process of privatisation worldwide, with reference to the electricity and water sector. With this methodology outlined, the third dimension is present. In this section of the thesis particular explanatory dimensions of the process of globalisation are examined, specifically geography, culture, economy, and politics. Using SNA techniques that build on the first phase of the quantitative analysis which examines ownership concentration and identifies the presence of the star-like pattern of ownership in all studied sectors of public utilities, a rich vein of evidence of the key features of privatisation worldwide is presented. The broad themes of this analysis are then drawn together in an assessment section. This assessment shows that economic globalisation reflects economic asymmetries and is related to political status, and that historical links make a considerable impact on the global ownership structures that have emerged in public services after privatisation. A key conclusion is that public services are being transformed as part of global capitalist system and that under the cover of globalisation a particular form of economic colonialism is emerging - the neo-colonialism that is centred on a few major western economies: The United States, France and the United Kingdom...|$|E
40|$|Developing a {{historically}} important city while retaining {{the essence of}} that place is a crucial issue confronted by architects, urban designers and planners <b>worldwide.</b> It <b>should</b> neither <b>be</b> a repetition of elements nor total disregard of conservational norms: if that city is an urbanized living city, many facets such as public services, commercial activities and conservation issues require consideration. Understanding the sense of place is considered as the means of ensuring healthy and sustainable development in a historical city.

40|$|Introduction: Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) is {{a common}} condition estimated to affect more than 150 million men <b>worldwide.</b> ED <b>should</b> <b>be</b> regarded as a shared sexual problem which has significant detrimental effects both on the men who experience this condition and on their partners. Evidence to support partner involvement in ED therapy: Evidence shows that the partner plays a key supportive role in the man 2 ̆ 7 s ED treatment and in successful long-term ED therapy. Including the partner in consultations may highlight discordant attitudes and communication problems between couple members which may indicate treatment acceptance or rejection, or realistic or unrealistic treatment expectations. Options for partner involvement in ED therapy: Most patients with ED consult their physician {{in the absence of}} their partner. Therefore, involving the partner in therapy can be challenging. Two options which physicians should consider are: encouraging the patient to bring the partner into the office and, often more realistically, seeking information about, and providing information to, the partner, via the patient. Objectives: The objective of these recommendations is to provide practical guidance on treating couples affected by ED, and suggest techniques that may be helpful in integrating the partner into the process of ED treatment. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Issues: Differences in type, structure, {{quality of}} health care systems and {{availability}} of resources influence reporting systems. In most countries, individual systems {{have a long history}} of usage that might preclude adoption of a uniform terminology worldwide. Consensus Position: It is desirable but unrealistic at this time to aim for a unified terminology <b>worldwide.</b> It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the stated objective of the International Academy of Cytology to serve as an umbrella organization for various terminologies and enhance mutual understanding and cooperation. Translation tables of equivalent terms have been created to allow increased communication. Consensus has been achieved in defining essential elements required of any terminology system: (1) the report must be text based: numerical Papanicolaou class designations alone are inadequate; (2) an assessment of the adequacy of the sample <b>should</b> <b>be</b> included; and (3) the diagnosis must address the primary purpose of cervical cytology: to indicate the presence or absence of epithelial abnormalities. Incorporating additional elements within a terminology system may be more or less appropriate, depending on the setting in which the system is used. Ongoing Issues: Despite the cited problems in adopting a uniform terminology worldwide, a single system would have many advantages in terms of communication and research and may be a long-term goal worth pursuing. Countries are invited to present their individual national terminology systems and participate in an ongoing dialogue, critically evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of all systems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
