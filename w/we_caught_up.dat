My feet was so sore when <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with them that I had to ride; I could not step. We traveld on for too days, when the men that owned the cattle said they would (could) not drive them another inch. We unyoked the oxen; we had about seventy pounds of flour; we took it out and divided it into four packs. Each of the men took about 18 pounds apiece and a blanket. I carried a little bacon, dried meat, and little quilt; I had in all about twelve pounds. We had one pint of flour a day for our alloyance. Sometimes we made soup of it; {{sometimes}} we (made) pancakes; and sometimes mixed it up with cold water and eat it that way. We traveld twelve or fourteen days. The time came at last when we should have to reach some place or starve. We saw fresh horse and cattle tracks. The morning come, we scraped all the flour out of the sack, mixed it up and baked it into bread, and made some soup, and eat everything we had. We traveld on all day without anything to eat, and that evening <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with a sheep train of eight wagons.

60|$|Of course, {{he could}} have drawn his {{revolver}} and fired at Demetrios; but we had long since found it contrary to our natures to shoot at a fleeing man guilty of only a petty offence. Also a sort of tacit agreement {{seemed to have been}} reached between the patrolmen and the fishermen. If we did not shoot while they ran away, they, in turn, did not fight if we once laid hands on them. Thus Demetrios Contos ran away from us, and we did no more than try our best to overtake him; and, in turn, if our boat proved faster than his, or was sailed better, he would, we knew, make no resistance when <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with him.|$|E

60|$|One day, {{as we were}} {{crossing}} a dike between rice swamps spread with delicate green, I saw the white tops of wagons flashing in the sun {{at the far end}} of it. <b>We</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with them, the wagoners cracking their whips and swearing at the straining horses. And lo! in front of the wagons was an army,--at least my boyish mind magnified it to such. Men clad in homespun, perspiring and spattered with mud, were straggling along the road by fours, laughing and joking together. The officers rode, and many of these had blue coats and buff waistcoats,--some the worse for wear. My father was pushing the white mare into the ditch to ride by, when one hailed him.|$|E
60|$|Sure enough, Sounder {{directly}} gave tongue {{from the}} side of the ravine. It was climb for us now. Broken shale, rocks of all dimensions, pinyons down and pinyons up made ascending no easy problem. We had to dismount and lead the horses, thus losing ground. Jones forged ahead and reached the top of the ravine first. When Wallace and I got up, breathing heavily, Jones and the hounds were out of sight. But Sounder kept voicing his clear call, giving us our direction. Off we flew, over ground that was still rough, but enjoyable going compared to the ravine slopes. The ridge was sparsely covered with cedar and pinyon, through which, far ahead, we pretty soon spied Jones. Wallace signaled, and our leader answered twice. <b>We</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with him on the brink of another ravine deeper and craggier than the first, full of dead, gnarled pinyon and splintered rocks.|$|E
60|$|Then first I {{knew what}} a devil's thrill runs through a man when he is given a bit of {{fighting}} to do. Up to now we had just lain and been killed, which is the weariest kind of work. Now it was our turn, and, my word, we were ready for it. Up we jumped, the whole brigade, in a four-deep line, and rushed at the cornfield {{as hard as we}} could tear. The skirmishers snapped at us as we came, and then away they bolted like corncrakes, their heads down, their backs rounded, and their muskets at the trail. Half of them got away; but <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> the others, the officer first, for he was a very fat man who could not run fast. It gave me quite a turn when I saw Rob Stewart, on my right, stick his bayonet into the man's broad back and heard him howl like a damned soul. There was no quarter in that field, and it was butt or point for all of them. The men's blood was aflame, and little wonder, for these wasps had been stinging all morning without our being able so much as to see them.|$|E

40|$|Here I wish {{to report}} on {{developments}} on three fronts concerning ‘religion’ in expanding global debates about the ‘the end of the world’ and ‘the ways we know it’, concerning: (1) the word ‘religion’ itself, as half of the religion-science binary, and its marginalization–or complete absence–in {{the construction of the}} modern scholarly disciplines and university departments, and influencing of ‘modern’ culture and politics; (2) proliferating doubts about the positivist (and secularist) epistemology of modern ‘science’; and (3) the growing sense that <b>we</b> are <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in epochal transitions, in which we are significant actors, and that, far beyond what we can know ‘scientifically’, our responses involve leaps of hope and faith which contribute to tipping the balance among divergent possible futures. </p...|$|R

60|$|The reconnaissances started next morning. The general {{accompanied}} {{the one to}} the Rambat pass, to satisfy himself as {{to the nature of}} the unexplored country on the other side. Two companies of infantry were ordered to clear the way, and two others remained in support half-way up the pass. Sir Bindon Blood started at six o'clock accompanied by his escort, whose gay pennons combined, with the Union Jack of the Headquarters staff, to add a dash of colour to the scene. After riding for a couple of miles <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> the infantry and had to halt, to let them get on ahead and work through the broken ground and scrub. A mile further it was necessary to dismount and proceed on foot. No opposition was encountered, though the attitude and demeanour of the natives was most unfriendly. The younger ones retired to the hills. The elder stayed to scowl at, and even curse us. The village cemetery was full of property of all kinds, beds, pitchers, and bags of grain, which the inhabitants had deposited there under the double delusion, that we wanted to plunder, and that in so sacred a spot it would be safe--were such our intention. In spite of their black looks, they were eventually all made to stand up and salute respectfully.|$|E

It was released in April 2001 as {{the third and final}} single from her gold-selling, second studio album, Come My Way (2000). The song is inspired by Anus hero Cathy Freeman. At a Mushroom Records press release, Anu said; “I met Cathy at the ARIA Music Awards {{a couple of years ago}} but it wasn’t until I saw her in Seville... that [...] "‘Coz I’m Free" [...] came together. I watched her win the World Championships and then <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> in London not long afterwards…. She’s so inspiring—her focus, how hard she trains, all that she’s achieved.

5000|$|People feel {{angry when}} they {{sense that they}} or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain {{about the nature and}} cause of the angering event, when they are {{convinced}} someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still in fluence the situation or cope with it. For instance, if a person's car is damaged, they will feel angry if someone else did it (e.g. another driver rear-ended it), but will feel sadness instead if it was caused by situational forces (e.g. a hailstorm) or guilt and shame if they were personally responsible (e.g. he crashed into a wall out of momentary carelessness).

5000|$|The {{pivotal role}} of Pippa was then given to Vanessa Downing at very short notice and the actress had to juggle a theatre {{production}} {{in which she}} was appearing along with the filming of the pilot episode of Home and Away. Downing appeared as Pippa until 1990, when she suddenly quit the series, apparently due to missing working with her former co-star Roger Oakley, who played her on screen husband Tom. Producers did not want to kill off the character, as she was crucial to the storyline, so they recast the part instead. Auditions were held and it came down to two actresses; Jackie Woodburne and Debra Lawrance. Lawrance commented [...] "We were, and still are, very dear friends. She and I were short-listed together and after our call back audition <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> for coffee. We both genuinely agreed that we didn't mind if the other got it." [...] Lawrance won the role and immediately took over from Downing in July 1990; there was no break in the storyline for the character, when Downing departed, Lawrance appeared as Pippa in the following episode with no attempt to explain the sudden change of appearance. Lawrance remained in the role until 1998 and has subsequently returned to guest star.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very short}} time ago I {{was sitting in the}} cockpit of an {{aeroplane}} flying towards an almost mythical place called Melbourne. It had seemed to us as we started about 5 centuries ago, and that Melbourne as soon as <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> one mile, receded two! So that made our journey very much longer than we had previously supposed. Particularly though it seems remarkable that only two hours ago one was in such a mental state, and now one is in a very different mental state, terribly embarrassed by your enthusiasm and yet very gracious to you all indeed for being so kind and welcoming us here this afternoon.Actually I wouldn't know I was here only somebody gave me a paper, and I see that it has my name on it, and of course as we all know, the press never lies! So, I don't think that I better say any more because I’ve talking too much to Campbell Black the last three days and I've got quite husky, I've been roaring at him ! He hasn't been roaring quite so much so I'm going to get him to talk. Scott's speech Movietone Black insisted that he had never made a speech in his life and that if he were going to say anything that it would only be [...] "Thank you".
