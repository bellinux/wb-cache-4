5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans {{were reluctant to}} allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E
5|$|Once {{these steps}} had {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.

5|$|In Vancouver, the {{organization}} Save the Grizzlies {{was established to}} find a local investor to purchase the team. Led by among others Peter Ufford, they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team. Ufford retrospectively stated that had the attempt been given more time, {{they may have been}} able to secure a deal to keep the team in town, but that the relocation decision came too quickly for any plan to be finalized. Heisley stated that he had been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the team with a 30% discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that the team would remain in town.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{arms were}} {{purchased}} {{on the black}} market from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports. Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important. All such purchases were highly risky, as the Gestapo was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, Hicks {{announced}} he would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> a minority interest in the team.

In July 2009, {{it was reported that}} Hicks borrowed money from Major League Baseball to meet the team's payroll. After the 2009 season, Hicks began scouting prospective buyers and in December, entered into exclusive negotiating rights for sale of the Rangers with a consortium headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer Chuck Greenberg and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan.|$|E

The mill was subsequently sold to George Mowrey who was apparently his miller at the time.

25|$|In 1853, the Island {{government}} {{passed the}} Land Purchase Act which empowered them to purchase lands from those owners who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> and then resell {{the land to}} settlers for low prices. This scheme collapsed when the Island ran short of money {{to continue with the}} purchases. Many of these lands also were fertile, and were some of the key factors to sustaining Prince Edward Island's economy.|$|E
25|$|Of the 65 mills that {{operated}} in Washington County, {{it is the}} only one still standing, and less than 20 still stand in Indiana. However, it was placed on Indiana's 10 Most Endangered List due to water damage and trespassers, some of whom vandalized the mill. Descendants of the original owners owned the mill and the surrounding area until November 2005, when the sixth generation became <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b>|$|E
25|$|Land {{sales were}} a {{continuing}} vexatious issue. The settlers {{were eager to}} buy land and some Māori were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> but under {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Waitangi, land sales required the Government as an intermediary, and were thus extremely slow. FitzRoy changed the rules to allow settlers to purchase Māori land directly, subject to a duty of ten shillings per acre. But land sales proved slower than expected.|$|E

50|$|Similar issues {{occur when}} a {{publicly}} held asset or non-profit organization undergoes privatization. Top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a government owned or non-profit entity is sold to private hands. Just {{as in the}} example above, they can facilitate this process by making the entity {{appear to be in}} financial crisis. This perception can reduce the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser) and make non-profits and governments more likely <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b> It can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run, reinforcing the political <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> off public assets.|$|R
25|$|The {{business}} {{was bought by}} the United Steel Companies Limited (USC) on 29 June 1945. USC needed replacement locomotives so {{it made sense to}} buy a manufacturer (at the right price) and the idea had been put forward of developing a central engineering workshop for their steelworks at Templeborough (Rotherham) and Stocksbridge. Both works were being expanded and redeveloped, and were easily accessible by rail from the YEC works. In the post war climate, the YEC management were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adding {{to their}} problems, the Portuguese were {{running out of}} provisions. As all Kandy was now in rebellion, nobody was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them any. Even if they {{managed to get a}} message through to Colombo, they could not expect {{resupply}} from that quarter: Pedro Homem Pereira did not have enough soldiers to escort a caravan, even if he was willing to cooperate. Goa was too far away; with the remaining supplies they could not expect to hold Kandy until help arrived.|$|E
25|$|The {{attitudes of}} the Catholic side towards the {{government}} and the ensuing Civil War was expressed in a joint episcopal letter from July 1, 1937, addressed by the Spanish bishops to all other Catholic bishops. Spain was said to be divided into two hostile camps, one side expresses anti-religious and anti-Spanish, the other side upholding the respect for the religious and national order. The Church was pastorally oriented and not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> its freedom to politics but had to side with those who started out defending its freedom and right to exist.|$|E

25|$|In October 1938, Germany started {{pushing for}} {{expansion}} of economic {{ties between the}} two countries and presented a plan to the Soviets on December 1, 1938. Stalin, however, was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> his increasingly strong economic bargaining position for the small price that Hitler was then willing to offer. The Soviets were willing to engage in talks discussing a new German offer in February and March 1939 in Moscow. Germany put the talks on hold in mid-March. A few days thereafter, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia and then the Klaipėda Region (Memel), making a German war with Poland far more likely.|$|E

On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.

25|$|William III, {{king of the}} Netherlands, and {{sovereign}} of Luxembourg, was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> {{the grand}} duchy to France's Emperor Napoleon III in order to retain Limbourg but backed out when Prussian chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, expressed opposition. The growing tension brought about a conference in London from March to May 1867 in which the British served as mediators between the two rivals. Bismarck manipulated public opinion, resulting in the denial of sale to France. The issue was resolved by the second Treaty of London which guaranteed the perpetual independence and neutrality of the state. The fortress walls were pulled down and the Prussian garrison was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|The Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Empire were {{political}} {{institutions in the}} ancient Roman Empire. During {{the reign of the}} second Roman Emperor, Tiberius, the powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies (the comitia) were transferred to the Senate. The neutering of the assemblies had become inevitable because the electors were, in general, ignorant as to the merits of the important questions that were laid before them, and often <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> their votes to the highest bidder. After the founding of the Roman Empire, the People of Rome continued to organize by Centuries and by Tribes, but by this point, these divisions had lost most of their relevance.|$|E
25|$|The land it thought {{should be}} {{acquired}} included {{about two-thirds of}} the land held by the British Central Africa Company, most of which was undeveloped. The committee’s official members expected that the major estate owners, whose representatives they had co-opted, would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> parts of their land voluntarily. However, both A L Bruce Estates Ltd and particularly the British Central Africa Company Ltd proved very reluctant to comply. The committee considered that the local management of the British Central Africa Company did not realise how discontented its tenants were, nor that it needed to sell much of its estates, but it did not wish to acquire the company's land compulsorily.|$|E
