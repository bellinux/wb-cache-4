500|$|The [...] Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{replaced}} the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947, and on January 1, 1948 it {{announced that the}} Argonne National Laboratory would be [...] "focused chiefly on problems of reactor development." [...] Zinn did not seek the additional responsibility, which he realised would divert the Laboratory away from research, and divert him from other responsibilities, such as designing a fast breeder reactor. He even obtained a written assurance from Carroll L. Wilson, the AEC's general manager, that it would not. He was therefore <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> with Alvin Weinberg to allow the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to remain involved in reactor design. Nonetheless, reactor research accounted for almost half the laboratory's budget in 1949, and 84 percent of its research was classified.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as he}} took up his role, Meyszner {{immediately}} {{ran into}} difficulties with Turner, {{who was responsible for}} internal affairs and co-operation with the puppet regime. Turner was a proponent of strengthening the puppet regime and making use of all Serbs that were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> with the occupiers. Meyszner had a diametrically opposed personal view and throughout his time in Belgrade refused to support or work with the Serb authorities, except at a purely tactical level. His dislike of Serbs was so great that he is said to have remarked, [...] "I like a dead Serb better than a live one". Meyszner was also reported to have referred to Serbs as [...] "a people of rats" [...] (...) [...] The historian Jonathan Steinberg describes Meyszner as one of Himmler's most brutal subordinates.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, Alfred Rosenberg, in his {{capacity}} as the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms in areas of the USSR under German occupation. [...] He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming, restoring family farms for those <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> with the occupiers. [...] But decollectivization conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and Hermann Göring demanded that the kolkhoz be retained, save for a change of name. [...] Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as 'stupid.' In the end, the German occupation authorities retained most of the kolkhozes and simply renamed them [...] "community farms" [...] ( [...] , a throwback to the traditional Russian commune). German propaganda described this as a preparatory step toward ultimate dissolution of the kolkhozes into private farms, which would be granted to peasants who had loyally delivered compulsory quotas of farm produce to the Germans. By 1943, the German occupation authorities had converted 30% of the kolkhozes into German-sponsored [...] "agricultural cooperatives", but as yet had made no conversions to private farms.|$|E

40|$|The {{challenging}} {{issue of}} value (co) creation {{has attracted a}} great number of researchers and decision makers to debates on ways to improve the capacity and <b>will</b> of actors <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> <b>to</b> produce better solutions and results. Some researchers have analysed value (co) creation {{as the result of the}} individual and collective <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>collaborate.</b> Referring <b>to</b> these reflections, this paper proposes to investigate the topic of value (co) creation from a different point of view. It highlights not only how the opportunities for value (co) creation are related to the individual and collective will, but that they are influenced by deep individual and collective psychological and sociological status. Hence, value (co) creation is proposed as the peak of the social pyramid, the last step of a staircase, each level of which represents a specific actor’s need. Therefore, the principal goal is to demonstrate that a win-win logic in the value (co) creation perspective is possible only if all the involved actors are in a condition of well-being...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} examine how {{projects}} based on social innovation, where several organizations from different sectors interact with each other, works together. The essay focuses on projects that are to improve the integration of newly arrived people in society {{and is based on}} a case study in Skåne (southern Sweden) where organizations in the public and non-profit sectors work together in a project called: NAD (Nätverk-Aktivitet-Delaktighet). The purpose is to see which factors that promote and prevents collaboration between the organizations involved in the project and the study is based on interviews with ten of the members and extracts from the project plan. The analysis of the collected data shows that multiple connections can be made between the empirical and the selected theory, but views on whether the collaboration factors were considered as positive or negative is not always consistent between them. The conclusion is partly factors that are perceived as the most important, is the so-called soft skills, such as knowledge, commitment and the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> for social innovation projects...|$|R
