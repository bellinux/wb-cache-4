25|$|In {{his recent}} book 'Back to the Mark' the fast bowler had written 'I try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a {{purposeful}} bouncer and I want it to hurt {{so much that the}} batsman doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> me any more'. How well he had succeeded in Edrich's case! The irony of his pyrrhic victory was that Edrich had not been felled by a bouncer...The English press greeted the incident with headlines such as: 'Licence to Kill!', 'Lillee should be banned' – '007, James Bond cricket'. The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E
25|$|When Natale {{was arrested}} in 1998, he agreed to become a {{government}} witness and cooperate with the FBI {{in exchange for a}} light sentence and admittance into the Federal Witness Protection Program. Natale had enough of Merlino undermining him and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> spending {{the rest of his life}} in prison. Between 1999 and 2001, Merlino, along with his underboss Stephen Mazzone, his consigliere George Borgesi, Martin Angelina, John Ciancaglini and others were arrested and put on trial for racketeering, illegal gambling, loan sharking, extortion, murder and attempted murder. Natale testified on the government's behalf, going into detail of the crimes Merlino's crew committed. Despite the prosecutions strong case, the defendants were acquitted of all murder charges. Merlino was also acquitted of narcotics trafficking charges. However, they were convicted of racketeering related charges with Merlino and Borgesi getting the longest prison sentences at 14 years each.|$|E
500|$|The {{manner in}} which Andros {{approached}} the issue was necessarily divisive, since it threatened any landowner whose title was in any way dubious. [...] Some landowners went through the confirmation process, but many refused, since they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the possibility of losing their land, and they viewed the process as a thinly veiled land grab. [...] The Puritans of Plymouth and Massachusetts, {{some of whom had}} extensive landholdings, were among the latter. [...] Since all of the existing land titles in Massachusetts had been granted under the now-vacated colonial charter, Andros essentially declared them to be void, and required landowners to recertify their ownership, paying fees to the dominion and becoming subject to the charging of a quit-rent.|$|E

500|$|Medows' {{campaign}} in 1790 was a limited success. [...] He occupied the Coimbatore district against minimal opposition, but a forceful counterattack by Tipu reduced the British holdings to Coimbatore itself {{and a few}} other outposts. [...] Tipu had also descended to the coastal plain, where he plowed through the Carnatic and even met with the French at Pondicherry in a fruitless attempt to draw them into the conflict. By September 1790 the British allies were taking the field, but still did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Tipu's strong force without significant British support. [...] Consequently, Cornwallis decided to personally take control of the main British force from Medows. [...] In early February 1791 he began a campaign that was squarely targeted at Mysore's capital, Seringapatam.|$|E
500|$|Her {{big break}} came in early 2001, when she {{appeared}} in a TV commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The commercial hinted at the fact she is transgender, zooming in to reveal her Adam's apple (although this was added digitally, since Harisu herself {{does not have a}} prominent Adam's apple). DoDo were initially cautious about using the commercial, and had been prepared to withdraw it if the response was negative, {{but it turned out to}} be a big success and quickly established her as a celebrity. As the Republic of Korea's first transgender entertainer, there was a great deal of media interest in Harisu, and she was routinely described as being [...] "more beautiful than a woman". Explaining her reasons for [...] "coming out", she said, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> people dishonestly. I won't be able to hide it after all. It's better to make it clear from the start." [...] In June 2001, Harisu was the subject of a television documentary produced by KBS, which covered her childhood, family relationships, and debut as an entertainer.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Coppola was put {{on trial}} for murder, {{racketeering}} and extorting the Local 1235 of the International Longshoremen's Association for over 30 years. If found guilty of all counts, he could have faced life imprisonment. Defense lawyer Henry Mazurek told jurors that Coppola admitted to making a [...] "rash" [...] decision to flee, but that it didn't prove he's a killer. [...] "He didn't want to stand trial for a murder he didn't commit," [...] Mazurek said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Dennehy told the jury not to be fooled by Coppola's claims and that Coppola [...] "ran because he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> a jury like you. He hid because he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> a jury like you." [...] Thomas Riccardi testified that Coppola {{said he did not}} agree with the Lardiere murder, but that he followed the orders given to him by Tino Fiumara (who was never charged). Genovese family member turned government witness George Barone was also called to aid the prosecution. Barone was such a difficult witness that the prosecutor apparently decided not to ask him about the Lardiere murder.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{controversy}} Hitler's War generated, it was a best-seller in 1977. In particular, Hitler's War was a best-seller in Germany The American author Gill Seidel summed up the appeal of Hitler's War to Germans as:"It {{is not difficult to}} explain its appeal. The argument of the book may be summed up as: [...] "If only the Führer had known about the murder of the Jews, he would had stopped it'. For...Germans who do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> up to the past, it was easy to be persuaded that if Hitler did not know, then neither did the person on the street." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, US Army [...] {{wrote that}} Russia's {{strategic}} objectives in the August War could {{be divided into}} two categories. The first category included the objectives that did not relate directly to planning a military campaign. With these objectives, Russia wanted to send a strong signal to the West that Russia returned to the world as powerful player, and was willing and able to use military force to protect its interests. A strong message was sent to Ukraine as well as other post-Soviet states with ethnic Russian populations that Russia would take steps to protect them and could use them as a means for expanding its influence and control in the region. The second category included those objectives that pertained directly to operational art since they articulated military requirements for the war. First, Russia wanted to gain control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Second, Russia aimed to [...] "demonstrate the tenuous authority of the Georgian government as well as Georgia’s economic dependence on Russian cooperation" [...] by humiliating Georgian government through a war and demonstrating that Russia could interdict Georgia’s economy at will. Third, Russia aimed to destroy Georgian armed forces in order to eliminate the threat to the two breakaway regions. The Russian military was likely given some restrictions for the use of force so as not to overly provoke the international community. The Russians acknowledged that a prolonged occupation of Georgia proper would cause a guerilla war; however the Russians did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> such a war, because they had already experienced one in Chechnya. Donovan dismissed the assertions that Georgian army should have fought better because it had American equipment and training, explaining that the Georgian military was trained for a different type of war, a counter-insurgency in Iraq.|$|E

5000|$|Many Carny {{words are}} still used by {{professional}} wrestlers, e.g. mark, work, snozz, et al.
