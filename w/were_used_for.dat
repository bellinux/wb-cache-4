5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E
5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} large stone columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> foundations and columns, while brick <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.|$|E

5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi.

In Paris, they <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E
