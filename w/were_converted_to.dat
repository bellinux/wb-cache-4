50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.|$|R
