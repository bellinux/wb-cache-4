5|$|Hitler {{promoted}} and practised the Führerprinzip. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates {{to their}} superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed {{himself in a}} position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler. Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer, as he felt to do so <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920 {{election}} campaign, Taft {{supported the}} Republican ticket, Harding (by then a senator) and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge; they were elected. Taft {{was among those}} asked {{to come to the}} president-elect's home in Marion, Ohio to advise him on appointments, and the two men conferred there on December 24, 1920. By Taft's later account, after some conversation, Harding casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court, for if Taft would, Harding <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> there. Taft had a condition for Harding: that having been president, and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis, he could only accept the chief justiceship. Harding made no response, and Taft in a thank-you note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had often told him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House. In January 1921, Taft heard through intermediaries that Harding planned to appoint him, if given the chance.|$|E
25|$|Richardson {{would serve}} as Secretary of Defense for 4 months before {{becoming}} Nixon's Attorney General, a move that <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the Watergate spotlight.|$|E

25|$|The wound Gustavus Adolphus {{received}} <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in bed until autumn, and {{his right}} arm was weakened with some fingers partially paralyzed. Until 1628 both sides would focus on consolidating their position without any major actions.|$|E
25|$|McCoy {{considered}} Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, {{and attacked}} his experimenter. Havok came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes {{proved to be}} even {{too much for the}} Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother Cyclops, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back in his place.|$|E
50|$|He {{kept his}} silence over the Suez Crisis until 1967. Then, his book, No End of a Lesson, {{explained}} that backing the Suez action <b>would</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{in the position}} of lying to the House of Commons and the United Nations.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now the other," [...] said I--not smiling, for a smile <b>would</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> on his guard; but {{somewhat}} sternly, so {{that that}} habit of obedience should not desert {{him at this}} perilous moment. And then I stretched out my hand.|$|R

25|$|Interest in {{one local}} {{election}} race surrounded Gérard Vignoble of the UDF, who had represented Roubaix since 1988. Vignoble {{announced that he}} would not stand again since this <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> against cardiologist Salem Kacet of the UMP, who had operated on him in 1999 and saved his life. The two candidates had become close friends. Vignoble said that it was impossible for him to come to any other decision. Nevertheless, Kacet still failed to take the seat, the winner being the Socialist Dominique Baert.|$|E
25|$|Mannock was {{conscious}} his poor educational and lower-class background <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> at a considerable disadvantage in the well-educated and higher-class surroundings of the RE. Mannock's solution to his problem was to throw {{himself into his}} work. The method was practical but his insular behaviour was construed as odd. Mannock despised his peers who were disinterested in the war and seemed concerned only with the uniforms, quality tailoring and how it would improve their chances with women. Tired of the banal conversations and lethargy of his comrades, Mannock looked to leave the RE but realised a second resignation would damage his chances of becoming a commissioned officer.|$|E
25|$|The saboteurs {{themselves}} prepared four {{boats to}} be used in future operations. After believing that they could operate independently, but being proven wrong in the training, the naval service decided to store the boats in the INS Ma'oz, due to its stern's construction and because the Ma'oz had poor armament and could not be counted on in ship-to-ship combat. Contrary to the modus operandi for the Italian sabotage units on World War II, the Israelis sought to prevent its soldiers from being taken prisoner. Therefore, a special rescue boat was allocated to retrieve the saboteurs, leaving three actual sabotage boats. Bin Nun engineered a lasso-like belt that would be cast into the water by the rescue crew, the swimmer <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> arm into it, and be hauled onto the boat.|$|E
50|$|Nikolopoulos lifted 57.0 {{kilograms}} {{with one}} hand, which <b>would</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{in a tie}} with Jensen had he lifted the same weight with his other hand. He lifted only 40.0 kilograms with the other, but was awarded third place as Versis could only lift 40.0 with either hand.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Rossi {{was given}} a special test of Kyle Busch's NASCAR Nationwide Series stock car at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Charlotte, North Carolina. Rossi {{achieved}} {{a top speed of}} 185 miles per hour, a speed which <b>would</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the top fifteen of a Nationwide Series race.|$|R

25|$|At this point, Grant faced a decision. His {{original}} {{orders were}} to capture Grand Gulf and then proceed south {{to link up}} with Banks and reduce Port Hudson, after which their combined armies would return and capture Vicksburg. Unfortunately for Grant, such a course <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{under the command of}} the more senior major general and the credit for any success in the theater would go to Banks. Since Banks was occupied with operations on the Red River and had informed Grant that he was not ready to begin operations against Port Hudson within the next few days, Grant decided to move on his own against Vicksburg. He sent a message to Halleck about his intentions, knowing that it would take as many as eight days for Washington to receive the message and respond.|$|E
25|$|After the war, young Nicolae {{returned}} to his home town and started attending the lyceum. Teaching standards were high, {{and many of the}} teachers later went on to become university professors; but the discipline was regimented, with mock-military physical exercises and wearing uniforms. Students were not permitted to leave the school at all, except in summer and briefly during Christmas and Easter. Nicolae proved to be an excellent student, especially in mathematics. He later credited the five years of secondary education he received at the lyceum for providing him with an extraordinary education that would serve him well later on in his career; but he also blamed the discipline and the monastic isolation of the place for having stunted his social abilities, something that <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> at odds with acquaintances and colleagues throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|At school, {{as well as}} in church, Francisco's claimed paranormal power {{constantly}} <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> into trouble. Once, {{while in}} his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but no one seemed to have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to have cared about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues and friends, who accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted to the challenge of improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen at that very moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E

"It {{was really}} tough {{to dig in}} and {{concentrate}} on that second putt because I really didnt think it was really all that important," [...] - Stewart Cink after missing a two-foot putt which ultimately <b>would</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the playoff with Goosen and Brooks (since Goosen missed his own two-foot putt seconds later).|$|R
60|$|But {{there still}} {{remained}} all {{the damage that}} had been done that day, and the king had nothing with which to pay for this. The troll, therefore, sentenced the king, either to answer three questions that he <b>would</b> <b>put</b> to <b>him,</b> or have his head taken off, as was agreed on in the old bond.|$|R
50|$|At his 2012 Pro Day, Grimes ran a 4.53-second 40-yard dash which <b>would</b> have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> {{in the top}} ten among {{running backs}} at the NFL Combine that year. He also had a 10-foot 5-inch broad jump and a 38-inch {{vertical}} jump, both of {{which would have been}} good enough for second place at the combine for his position.|$|R
25|$|On 19 November the Red Army began {{a counter}} offensive, named Operation Uranus. Within days, the Soviets had encircled some 300,000 German, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian {{soldiers}} {{in the city of}} Stalingrad. It was decided by Hitler and the OKL to supply the Axis forces by air. Richthofen was horrified. He telephoned Berchtesgaden and tried to get through to Hitler, but none of his aides <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> through. He tried to convince Göring that his air fleet did not have the resources to sustain an air lift, and that the best option would be to attempt a breakout before the Soviet forces entrenched. He flew to Manstein's headquarters, and the Field Marshal agreed a breakout must take place. With the Sixth Army preserved, the initiative could be regained later. He made this request to Hitler. The Soviet divisions were smaller than their German counterparts: but they had 97. Holding Stalingrad was now impossible.|$|E
25|$|In the Western Conference, {{the race}} was tight. Allen Iverson, {{formerly}} the seven-time East point guard starter, moved to Denver from Philadelphia, attracting votes from reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash. But surprisingly, neither of the two was voted in; both were reserves as swingman Tracy McGrady came {{in the back door}} win. Dirk Nowitzki, another player who analysts predicted that would be starting, was not able to muster enough votes to get over former MVP Kevin Garnett's 1,600,000, but was put in by coaches as a reserve and later added to the starting lineup by West coach Mike D'Antoni. Tim Duncan was also voted in as a forward. Carmelo Anthony, the star small forward for the Nuggets, was not voted in as a starter or reserve, contrary to earlier reports that head coaches from the conference <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in the lineup despite being involved in a brawl, but was allowed as a reserve (because Carlos Boozer was injured). Mehmet Okur of the Utah Jazz and Ray Allen of the Seattle Sonics were chosen by Stern to replace the injured Nash and Iverson.|$|E
25|$|On the 18th The Mexican Imperial General O'Horán, persuaded Díaz to {{meet him}} halfway at night and used red light signals to {{identify}} himself while sneaking out undiscovered from the capital. Díaz escorted by drummers and buglers responded with the same signal, that unfortunately revealed his position to the Imperialist shooters who instantly opened fire on him. O'Horán blamed Márquez for the incident and swore his innocence. The second night O'Horan {{came out of the}} capital and met Díaz, which they did this time. He offered to surrender the city, including Márquez and the other principal officers, with the sole condition of obtaining a passport to go abroad. Díaz felt that such an offer is pointless considering the city was helpless, and that as for the other leaders I would fulfill my duty. O'Horán insisted that however the city would fall the capture of the wanted officers was uncertain, but his offer guaranteed both. Díaz refused again and warned the General that although he let him get away that time he <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> under custody as soon as the city was to be captured.|$|E
60|$|The King of the Romans {{took refuge}} within an old mill, {{and here it}} was that Norman of Torn found him barricaded.

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Blonds {{dropped the}} titles, the team was again {{temporarily}} split up. Austin and Pillman both claimed that it was for political reasons. Austin was given a singles push challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. After Pillman finally recovered, he and Austin had a few more matches together taking on teams such as Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio, Scorpio and Ron Simmons, Simmons and Ice Train, and jobber tag team Frankie Rowe and Jimmy Rogers. The Blonds also confronted The Nasty Boys and Missy Hyatt during an interview after The Nasty Boys had won the titles from Anderson and Roma. The Blonds last match as a team {{took place on the}} October 30, 1993 episode of Saturday Night. After the Blonds had defeated a jobber tag team, Col. Rob Parker (who had just become Austin's new manager) came to ringside to congratulate Austin (and not Pillman) on winning the match. Pillman took exception to Parker snubbing him. Parker brought up Pillman's bad leg and said if he was a race horse, he <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> down. Pillman attacked Parker, which in turn led to Austin attacking and turning on Pillman, turning Pillman face and the Blonds broke up for the third and final time.|$|E
500|$|On {{graduating in}} 1943, Shea {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Navy and {{enrolled}} in a program that <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> through college. He began his studies at Dartmouth College, later moving to MIT and finally to the University of Michigan, where he would remain until he earned his Doctorate in 1955. In 1946, he was commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. Shea went on to earn a MSc (1950) and a Ph.D. (1955) in Engineering Mechanics from the University of Michigan. While obtaining his doctorate, Shea found the time to teach at the university and to hold down a job [...] at Bell Labs.Mueller, [...] "Joseph F. Shea," [...] in Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 10, p. 211.|$|E
500|$|Commented {{longtime}} former Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox on Bagwell – {{who opposed}} {{him from the}} dugout for the entirety of his career, including numerous times in the playoffs: [...] "Jeff Bagwell was [...] {{for so long and}} starred every year. [...] For me a guy that dominated like that for one team, even in the league stats through the years. [...] His are up there with anybody's. [...] I <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in right away. [...] So he would get my vote on the first ballot." [...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E
50|$|During qualifying, Piercarlo Ghinzani's Ligier {{ran out of}} fuel {{in front}} of the pits. His {{mechanics}} jumped the pit wall, refuelled him on the track and then push-started him, a clear violation of the rules leading to Ghinzani's exclusion from the remainder of the event.
