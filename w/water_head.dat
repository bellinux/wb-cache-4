25|$|From the start, St. John Nepomucene Church {{served as}} a focal point, {{although}} other churches would soon spring up in the other communities. The first settlers would have devoted all energies to clearing land, planting, building small homes and barns, fencing and raising livestock. The private Fox River Canal was a failure. The State “Fox and Wisconsin Improvement Company” took over operations in 1850 and finished the canal and adjoining dam by 1856. Railways approached {{from the south and}} steamship lines were established on Lakes Michigan and Winnebago. The 16 feet of <b>water</b> <b>head</b> at La Petite Chute and other falls was used for mills, a practice that continues. Little Chute post office was established in 1849. In 1898 the fiftieth anniversary of the founding was commemorated and the surviving “48’ers” recognized. In 1898, residents of La Petite Chute petitioned the State of Wisconsin for incorporation as the Village of Little Chute, which was formally granted on March 8, 1899.|$|E

Rogers, commanding the steamer Esmeralda with a barge and ninety tons of freight, reached Callville, Nevada, on October 8, 1866. [...] Callville remained {{the head of}} navigation on the river until July 7, 1879, when Captain J. A.

2500|$|There {{are four}} {{recessive}} defects {{that can affect}} calves worldwide. A recessive defect occurs when both parents carry a recessive gene that will affect the calf. One in four calves will show the defect even when both parents carry the defective gene. The four recessive defects in the Black Angus breed that are currently managed with DNA tests are arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), referred to as curly calf, which lowers the mobility of joints; neuropathic hydrocephalus (NH), sometimes known as <b>water</b> <b>head,</b> which causes an enlarged malformed skull; contractural arachnodactyly (CA), formerly referred to {{by the name of}} [...] "fawn calf syndrome", which reduces mobility in the hips; and dwarfism, which affects the size of calves. Both parents need to carry the genes for a calf to be affected with one of these disorders.|$|E

60|$|Unfortunately for {{the youth}} he had {{rested on a}} rock which {{was by no means}} secure {{on the bank of the}} stream, and now, as he leaned to one side, the rock slipped from its resting-place, and down went poor Earl into the <b>water</b> <b>head</b> first. As luck would have it, he struck in some loose sand, {{otherwise}} he would have been seriously injured. Even as it was he was stunned for the moment, and before he could turn he had gulped down a great deal of water. He was nearly blinded by some fine sand getting into his eyes and began to flounder around as though in the midst of an ocean instead of a watercourse less than fifty feet wide and five feet deep.|$|E
60|$|Life {{that lives}} is life successful, and {{success is the}} breath of its nostrils. The {{achievement}} of a difficult feat is successful adjustment to a sternly exacting environment. The more difficult the feat, the greater the satisfaction at its accomplishment. Thus {{it is with the}} man who leaps forward from the springboard, out over the swimming pool, and with a backward half-revolution of the body, enters the <b>water</b> <b>head</b> first. Once he leaves the springboard his environment becomes immediately savage, and savage the penalty it will exact should he fail and strike the water flat. Of course, the man does not have to run the risk of the penalty. He could remain on the bank in a sweet and placid environment of summer air, sunshine, and stability. Only he is not made that way. In that swift mid-air moment he lives as he could never live on the bank.|$|E

60|$|And {{the trout}} {{and he made}} it up (for trout very soon forget {{if they have been}} frightened and hurt). So Tom used to play with them at hare and hounds, and great fun they had; and he used to try to leap out of the <b>water,</b> <b>head</b> over heels, as they did before a shower came on; but somehow he never could manage it. He liked most, though, to see them rising at the flies, as they sailed round and round under the shadow of the great oak, where the beetles fell flop into the water, and the green {{caterpillars}} let themselves down from the boughs by silk ropes {{for no reason at all}}; and then changed their foolish minds for no reason at all either; and hauled themselves up again into the tree, rolling up the rope in a ball between their paws; which is a very clever rope-dancer's trick, and neither Blondin nor Leotard could do it: but why they should take so much trouble about it no one can tell; for they cannot get their living, as Blondin and Leotard do, by trying to break their necks on a string.|$|E
60|$|When Nanea {{leapt from}} the dizzy {{platform}} that overhung the Pool of Doom, a strange fortune befell her. Close {{in to the}} precipice were many jagged rocks, and on these {{the waters of the}} fall fell and thundered, bounding from them in spouts of spray into the troubled depths of the foss beyond. It was on these stones that the life was dashed out from the bodies of the wretched victims who were hurled from above. But Nanea, it will be remembered, had not waited to be treated thus, and as it chanced the strong spring with which she had leapt to death carried her clear of the rocks. By a very little she missed the edge of them and striking the deep <b>water</b> <b>head</b> first like some practised diver, she sank down and down till she thought that she would never rise again. Yet she did rise, {{at the end of the}} pool in the mouth of the rapid, along which she sped swiftly, carried down by the rush of the water. Fortunately there were no rocks here; and, since she was a skilful swimmer, she escaped the danger of being thrown against the banks.|$|E
