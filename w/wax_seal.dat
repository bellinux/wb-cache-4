5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Vijayanagara empire {{maintained}} the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary. The King was the ultimate authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers (Pradhana) headed by the prime minister (Mahapradhana). Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary (Karyakartha or Rayaswami) and the imperial officers (Adhikari). All high-ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training. A secretariat near the king's palace employed scribes and officers to maintain records made official by using a <b>wax</b> <b>seal</b> imprinted with the ring of the king. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords (Goudas) supervised accountants (Karanikas or Karnam) and guards (Kavalu). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments (Niyogas), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.|$|E
25|$|A {{graveyard}} {{was situated}} to the north-east of the church, with {{the graves of}} the Audley family and senior clergy members being found in the church itself. The excavation works between 1987 and 1994 uncovered the remains of 91 individuals; the large proportion were of men but those {{of women and children}} have also been identified. A number of artifacts have been discovered with the excavated burials, including a pilgrim's staff and a wax chalice. A <b>wax</b> <b>seal,</b> with the impression of the church of Santo Spirito in Sassia, Rome, was found with one set of remains. Professor John Cherry has posited that the seal was attached to an indulgence obtained whilst on a pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|Six {{post offices}} were opened at {{competition}} venues, {{two of them}} in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and <b>wax</b> <b>seal</b> affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of a postal system, the use of <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> has become more for {{ceremony}} than security. Modern times have required new styles of wax, allowing for mailing of the seal without damage or removal.

500|$|It {{is unclear}} when Kujau {{produced}} his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau {{gave him a}} diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters [...] "AH" [...] in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used [...] "FH" [...] rather than [...] "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army <b>wax</b> <b>seal.</b> For the ink he bought two bottles of Pelikan ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk {{to give them an}} aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could have it on loan.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish navy {{retained}} the briefcase and, despite pressure from Adolf Clauss {{and some of}} his [...] agents, neither it or its contents were handed over to the Germans. On 5May the briefcase was passed to the naval headquarters at San Fernando near Cadiz, for forwarding to Madrid. While at San Fernando the contents were photographed by German sympathisers, but the letters were not opened. Once the briefcase arrived in Madrid, its contents became the focus of attention of Karl-Erich Kühlenthal, one of the most senior [...] agents in Spain. He asked admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the , to personally intervene and persuade the Spanish to surrender the documents. Acceding to the request, the Spanish removed the still-damp paper by tightly winding it around a probe into a cylindrical shape, and then pulling it out between the envelope flap – which was still closed by a <b>wax</b> <b>seal</b> – and the envelope body. The letters were dried and photographed, then soaked in salt water for 24 hours before being re-inserted into their envelopes, without the eyelash that had been planted there. The information was passed to the Germans on 8May. This was deemed so important by the [...] agents in Spain that Kühlenthal personally took the documents to Germany.|$|E

For example, important documents were sent written on a papyrus scroll <b>sealed</b> with several <b>wax</b> <b>seals.</b> <b>Wax</b> <b>seals</b> were typically placed across {{the opening of a}} scroll, so that only the proper person in the presence of witnesses, could open the document.

60|$|On the whole, it is {{a matter}} of endless difficulty, that of the Clergy. Clerical {{property}} may be made the Nation's, and the Clergy hired servants of the State; but if so, is it not an altered Church? Adjustment enough, of the most confused sort, has become unavoidable. Old landmarks, in any sense, avail not in a new France. Nay literally, the very Ground is new divided; your old party-coloured Provinces become new uniform Departments, Eighty-three in number;--whereby, as in some sudden shifting of the Earth's axis, no mortal knows his new latitude at once. The Twelve old Parlements too, what is to be done with them? The old Parlements are declared to be all 'in permanent vacation,'--till once the new equal-justice, of Departmental Courts, National Appeal-Court, of elective Justices, Justices of Peace, and other Thouret-and-Duport apparatus be got ready. They have to sit there, these old Parlements, uneasily waiting; as it were, with the rope round their neck; crying as they can, Is there none to deliver us? But happily the answer being, None, none, they are a manageable class, these Parlements. They can be bullied, even into silence; the Paris Parliament, wiser than most, has never whimpered. They will and must sit there; in such vacation as is fit; their Chamber of Vacation distributes in the interim what little justice is going. With the rope round their neck, their destiny may be succinct! On the 13th of November 1790, Mayor Bailly shall walk to the Palais de Justice, few even heeding him; and with municipal seal-stamp and a little hot <b>wax,</b> <b>seal</b> up the Parlementary Paper-rooms,--and the dread Parlement of Paris pass away, into Chaos, gently as does a Dream! So shall the Parlements perish, succinctly; and innumerable eyes be dry.|$|E
