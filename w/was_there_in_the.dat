2500|$|The {{thematic}} {{substance of}} McOndo {{is based upon}} its literary predecessors, yet its representations {{of the experience of}} being a Latin American man and a Latin American woman in an urban (city–suburban) world pervaded by U.S. pop culture, are in direct opposition to the politically-metaphoric, rural narratives used as political discourse by the Latin American Boom generation of writers, especially the magical-realists. Moreover, some novelists left their patrias (fatherlands), for the detached (foreign) perspective unavailable in the homeland. As a result, as exiles are wont to do, they idealized their patrias and wrote pithy novels of a land that should have been — yet always <b>was</b> <b>there</b> ... <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exiled writer's memory; thus the well-crafted fiction did not portray the contemporary national reality that had displaced the country (patria) he departed.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he rejects}} the label, Maus is {{recognized}} as a progenitor of the hypnagogic pop scene, a genre noted for its reliance on memory and nostalgia. His compositions tend to employ the use of particular modal scales previously associated with Renaissance and Medieval music, which he believes is often mistaken {{as an attempt to}} evoke the 1980s. He explains that [...] "I'm not trying to evoke that time, I just hear that sound and it seems to suit this time right now. ... People associate the kind of harmonies that associate from the modes with the 80s sound, and for me it's not about the 80s, it's about what I think the kind of harmony is that arises from these modes - what I'm interested in." [...] He adds: [...] "For whatever reason, the pioneers of electronic music that came out of Sheffield and Manchester in the 1980s became interested in these ecclesiastical modes that, historically, were associated with the divine. ... The palette <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 80s so why was it set aside and forgotten? That thread can be taken up again."
