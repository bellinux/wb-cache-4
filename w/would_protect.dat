5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an enemy sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole that <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was {{housed in a}} metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.|$|E

The height of the walls would force attackers to use scaling-ladders. The parapet of the rampart would have crenellations to provide protection from missiles for defenders.|$|E
5|$|The Tea Party {{movement}} has been arguing for repealing the Seventeenth Amendment entirely, claiming that it <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> states' rights and reduce {{the power of the}} federal government. On March 2, 2016, the Utah legislature approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 asking Congress to offer an amendment to the United States Constitution that would repeal the Seventeenth Amendment.|$|E
50|$|The ERA was and {{is still}} heavily {{supported}} by Black women. One {{of the ways that}} it was projected to protect Black Women was the clause that stated that women would not be discriminated on the basis of sex. If the ERA is passed into law, it would be illegal for Black women to be discriminated against in any institutions such as employment, because they <b>would</b> be <b>protected</b> under the law. Another area in which Black women <b>would</b> be <b>protected</b> if the ERA were to be passed is violence that is done to women of color. If an instance of abuse or violence occurs, Black women <b>would</b> be <b>protected</b> under the law when they are able to report their crime. It would be least likely that they would be neglected or dismissed because they <b>would</b> be <b>protected</b> under the constitution.|$|R

5|$|Turner Catledge, the top {{editor at}} The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted {{to hide the}} {{ownership}} influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos it <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.|$|E
5|$|Back in the 1980s, the {{ideology}} of Hezbollah was described as radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first objective was fighting against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E

5|$|Lower-class {{citizens}} used common {{forms of}} funerary art—including shabti figurines (to perform any labor {{that might be}} required of the dead person in the afterlife), models of the scarab beetle and funerary texts—which they believed <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> them in the afterlife. During the Middle Kingdom, miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate {{the activities of the}} living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund made Vlad a {{first-class}} {{member of the}} Order of the Dragon (a chivalric order established by Sigismund) in Nuremberg on 8 February 1431. Other first-class members included Alfonso V of Aragon and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The dragon-shaped badge of the order gave rise to his Romanian sobriquet, Dracul ("the Dragon"), for which his sons became known as Dracula ("son of Dracul"). Vlad swore fealty to Sigismund who declared him the lawful prince of Wallachia. Vlad had to promise that he <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> the Roman Catholic Church. However, Sigismund did not assist him to seize Wallachia. In the summer, Vlad's half-brother, Alexander I Aldea, invaded Wallachia with Moldavian support and dethroned Dan II.|$|E

5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|The League soon sent envoys to its neighbors, Stefan I Crnojević and Đurađ Branković. Branković, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who {{was also}} in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, {{expressed}} his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but not against the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> the country and keep the roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, {{refused to accept the}} offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was against the war with Venice and did not participate in it.|$|E
5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.|$|E

5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E

She was unanimously re-elected the following year. In her fourth year of service on the board beginning on January 3, 1995, she lost a 4–3 election for Columbus School Board President when the incumbent, Robert W. Teater, cast a tie-breaking vote for himself. She subsequently declined the vice presidency. During her fourth year, she unsuccessfully attempted to include a sexual orientation policy in the school district's nondiscrimination policy that <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> homosexuals. She was reelected in 1995. In 1996, she contested Ohio's 16th district seat in the Ohio State Senate with Eugene Watts, but she lost by a 51.80–37.46% margin in a five-way contest.|$|E
5|$|Crusading was {{a popular}} cause in the 13th century, and in 1248 Louis joined the ill-fated Seventh Crusade, having first made a fresh truce with England and {{received}} assurances from the Pope that he <b>would</b> <b>protect</b> his lands against any attack by Henry. Henry might have joined this crusade himself, but the rivalry between the two kings made this impossible and, after Louis's defeat at the Battle of Al Mansurah in 1250, Henry instead {{announced that he would}} be undertaking his own crusade to the Levant. The King began to make arrangements for passage with friendly rulers around the Levant, imposing efficiency savings on the royal household and arranging for ships and transport: he appeared almost over-eager to take part. Henry's plans reflected his strong religious beliefs, but they also stood to give him additional international credibility when arguing for the return of his possessions in France.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Malaya {{received}} {{its independence from}} Britain {{as part of their}} decolonisation process in that region. The British government, in their reorganisation of the region following their departure, sought to combine Malaya with Singapore and the states of Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei to form a new 'Malaysian Federation.' This would serve British interests in these regions, particularly military basing rights, which they hoped the Malaysians <b>would</b> <b>protect.</b> Indonesia, however, and in particular President Sukarno, was fiercely opposed to such a project. Sukarno, who was leaning ever closer towards the Communist bloc of China and Russia, despised the 'imperialist' British, and had planned to incorporate the latter three regions, all of which are located on the northern tip of Borneo, with the Indonesian-controlled territory of Kalimantan, which makes up the vast majority of that island. Sukarno determined to begin a military Confrontation with Malaysia, which through a series of raids and supported revolts might improve Indonesia's position in negotiating for the island.|$|E
