5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

2500|$|The sand tiger shark's {{description}} as Carcharias taurus by Constantine Rafinesque {{came from}} a specimen caught {{off the coast of}} Sicily. Carcharias taurus means [...] "bull shark". This taxonomic classification has been long disputed. Twenty-seven years after Rafinesque's original description the German biologists Müller and Henle changed the genus name from C. taurus to Triglochis taurus. The following year, Swiss-American naturalist Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz reclassified the shark as Odontaspis cuspidata based on examples of fossilized teeth. Agassiz's name was used until 1961 when three palaeontologists and ichthyologists, W. Tucker, E. I. White, and N. B. Marshall, requested that the shark be returned to the genus Carcharias. This request was rejected and Odontaspis was approved by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). When experts concluded that taurus belongs after Odontaspis, the name was changed to Odontaspis taurus. In 1977, Compagno and Follet challenged the Odontaspis taurus name and substituted Eugomphodus, a somewhat unknown classification, for Odontaspis. Many taxonomists questioned his change, arguing that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> Odontaspis and Carcharias. After changing the name to Eugomphodus taurus, Compagno successfully advocated in establishing the shark's current scientific name as Carcharias taurus. The ICZN approved this name, and today it is used among biologists.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the amount of homework assigned to sophomore and senior high school students of White Plains High School, White Plains, New York, during a typical school day, and to determine certain parent, teacher and student reactions and expectations relative to those assignments. The subject areas for which homework assignments were studied in detail, and upon which correlations were made, were English, mathematics, social studies, and science. Instruments, specifically developed to correlate responses from three different groups were completed by 159 parents of students involved in the study, 54 teachers of the four subject areas indicated above, 505 sophomores, and 408 seniors. Two hundred and eighteen student response sheets which were electronically rejected because of deviations in responding techniques, were hand scored to obtain responses to specific questions. All other response sheets were tabulated electronically. Because of an insufficient number of responses, data gathered from the parent instruments were not used for statistical analysis. Data obtained from the various instruments were applied to the chi-square test of independence to determine rejection of null hypotheses. In applying data obtained from questionnaires to the chisquare formula, eight hypotheses were rejected and five hypotheses were not rejected. There was insufficient data to allow application of this formula to one of the hypotheses; one hypothesis, therefore, remains untested. The hypotheses that were rejected are:There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that English teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that mathematics teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time spent on homework between college-bound and non college-bound students. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time spent on homework between sophomore and senior populations. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time spent on homework between boy and girl populations. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject of English between sophomore and senior populations. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject of mathematics between sophomore and senior populations. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject of science between sophomore and senior populations. The hypotheses that were not rejected are:There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that social studies teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that homework is worked on in school between boy and girl populations. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that homework is worked on in school between sophomore and senior populations. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject area of social studies between sophomore and senior populations. The hypothesis that was not tested because of insufficient data is:There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that science teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. In general, the data indicate that girls tend to spend more time on homework than boys, sophomores spend more time on homework than seniors, college-bound students spend more time on homework than non college-bound students, and that there is a disparity between the length of time that teachers think that it will take students to complete an assignment and the length of time that students work on those assignments.
