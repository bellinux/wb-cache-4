5|$|Throughout 2014, Miliband changed Labour's {{policy on}} immigration, partly in {{response}} to UKIP's performance in the European and local elections in May, and the close result in the Heywood and Middleton by-election in October. Miliband committed to increase funding for border checks, tackle exploitation and the undercutting of wages, require employers who recruit abroad to create apprenticeships, and ensure workers in public-facing roles have minimum standards of English. In November 2014, Labour announced plans to require new EU migrants <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> years before claiming benefits.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when no one else was").|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Robinson fought five times, {{but only}} one bout was a title defense. Among the fighters he {{defeated}} in those non-title bouts was future world champion Kid Gavilán in a close, controversial 10-round fight. Gavilán hurt Robinson {{several times in the}} fight, but Robinson controlled the final rounds with a series of jabs and left hooks. In 1949, he boxed 16 times, but again only defended his title once. In that title fight, a rematch with Gavilán, Robinson again won via decision. The first half of the bout was very close, but Robinson took control in the second half. Gavilán would have to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> more years to begin his own historic reign as welterweight champion. The only boxer to match Robinson that year was Henry Brimm, who fought him to a 10-round draw in Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|Schnaufer had to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> {{months to}} achieve another victory, {{claiming}} {{the destruction of}} two Vickers Wellingtons and one Armstrong Whitworth Whitley within the space of 62 minutes {{in the early hours}} of 1 August. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer flew their first combat mission with the Lichtenstein radar on the night 5/6 August 1942. Though they managed to make contact with an enemy aircraft they failed to shoot it down. On the night of the 24/25 August 1942, Schnaufer became an ace (his fifth aerial victory), when he filed a claim for another Wellington. This was the first time Rumpelhardt had guided him into contact using the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF-band airborne radar. His next claim was made on the night of 28/29 August. This was probably a No. 78 Squadron Halifax II W7809, piloted by Sergeant John A. B. Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, on a secondary attack against Saarbrücken. The primary attack force was targeting Nuremberg that night. On the night of the 21/22 December 1942, Schnaufer shot down an Avro Lancaster; his first victory against this type. It was Schnaufer's seventh victory. Schnaufer may also have been responsible for the destruction of another Lancaster that night. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer had attacked a Lancaster and observed it catching fire followed by the aircraft plunging earthwards. Hauptmann Wilhelm Herget from I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (I./NJG4—1st group of the 4th Night Fighter Wing) had also attacked a four-engined bomber in the same vicinity. The draw decided in favour of Herget who was given credit for the destruction of the Lancaster.|$|E

Several cargo planes also land here. The cost of a flight, however, is beyond the means of most private individuals; passengers tend to be people working for NGOs or businesses in Kinshasa.|$|E

He {{would have to}} <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> more years before playing another first-class match for Hampshire, between then he played for the Second XI, who he first represented in 1994. In that same season he made his debut in List A cricket against Middlesex. Savident was an irregular feature in the Hampshire one-day side the following season.|$|E
25|$|Keating {{struggled}} to get workers' compensation reform and right to work laws enacted due to the political makeup of the Oklahoma Legislature. Keating adjusted policies, made new appointments to Oklahoma’s Worker’s Compensation Court, and took other measures to control Oklahoma’s rising worker’s compensation costs. He would have to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> years to see his vision for a right to work fulfilled. The Legislature decided to propose anti-union right to work measures as a 2001 constitutional amendment. Keating’s six-year battle {{came to an end}} when, on September 21, 2001, Oklahomans approved the measure.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} after this, MacArthur {{expressed}} his belief that an attempt to recapture the Philippines was necessary. The U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Chester Nimitz and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest King both opposed this idea, arguing that it must wait until victory was certain. MacArthur had to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> years for his wish; it was 1944 before a campaign to recapture the Philippines was launched. The island of Leyte was the first objective of the campaign, which was captured {{by the end of}} December 1944. This was followed by the attack on Mindoro and later, Luzon.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E
25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Le Touquet had the Merlimont Plage Hotel as an objective. Intelligence had {{suggested}} that the Germans were using the hotel as a barracks. When the group reached the hotel they discovered it was empty and {{the doors and windows}} boarded up. Unable to find another target, they returned to the beach, only to discover their boat had put back out to sea. During the <b>wait,</b> <b>two</b> German sentries stumbled on the group and were quietly killed by the troops' bayonets. Another German patrol then approached across the sand dunes and the group was forced to swim out to the boat, leaving its weapons behind.|$|E
25|$|Browder {{applied for}} a visa to travel to Moscow to appeal his expulsion, but {{he was forced to}} <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> months for its approval. In the {{meantime}} he continued to issue his Distributors Guide, which became explicitly more pro-Stalin and pro-Soviet in later issues. With his visa finally approved, Browder ended publication of his newsletter at the end of April 1946. The former American party leader departed for the Soviet Union to determine whether his expulsion could be overturned. Browder arrived in Moscow on May 3 and met with old friends, including Solomon Lozovsky, former head of the Profintern, as well as Stalin's right-hand man, Viacheslav Molotov.|$|E

25|$|From 1918 to 1923, Richter {{attended}} the State School in Kraslice. When he was 11 years old, Richter {{attended the}} Staats-Oberreal-Gymnasium {{in the city}} of Most (Brüx in German). Richter graduated in 1927 at the age of 16 years and spent the next two years working as an apprentice at the Citroen car workshop {{in the city of}} Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad in German). Upon completion of his apprenticeship, around 1930, Richter returned home and worked in his father's metal-work business. In 1932, with support from his father, Richter started a car-rental business, but by 1934 the business had failed. Unemployed for six months, Richter sought to join the Czechoslovak Army but was rejected three times on medical grounds. In 1935, Richter wrote to the American Consul in Prague, seeking an American visa, but was told he would have to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> years.|$|E
25|$|The Loughgall ambush {{took place}} on 8 May 1987 {{in the village of}} Loughgall, Northern Ireland. An eight-man unit of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{launched}} an attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) barracks in the village. An IRA member drove a digger with a bomb in its bucket through the perimeter fence, {{while the rest of the}} unit arrived in a van and fired on the building. The bomb exploded and destroyed almost half of the base. Soldiers of the British Army's Special Air Service (SAS) then returned fire from the base and opened fire from hidden ambush positions around it, killing all IRA members. The security forces were aware of the IRA plan and the 24-man SAS unit had been lying in <b>wait.</b> <b>Two</b> of the IRA members were unarmed. A civilian was also killed by the SAS after unwittingly driving into the ambush zone.|$|E
25|$|Konstantin was {{nineteen}} and Alexandra three years younger; {{they were engaged}} but had to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> more years to get married. On 12 October 1847, she arrived in Russia. In February she converted to Russian Orthodoxy, taking the name of Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna. They were married six months later on 11 September 1848 in the Winter Palace. Both were musical: he played the cello and she the piano. They {{seem to have been}} a good match. For the first years of their marriage, they were a devoted couple, starting their married life happily. In the following years, they had six children. The couple lived {{in some of the most}} luxurious palaces of the Empire: Pavlovsk, Strelna, and the Marble Palace. Konstantin received the Marble Palace in St.Petersburg as a wedding gift from his parents with Strelna, on the Gulf of Finland, as their country retreat. A year after his marriage Konstantin inherited Pavlovsk from his uncle Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, and, at the death of his mother, the palace of Oreanda in Crimea.|$|E

25|$|David Robinson {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history. He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol Ralph Sampson. By the time he took the court in his first basketball game for the Navy Midshipmen men's basketball team, he had grown to 6ft 9in (2.06m), and {{over the course of his}} college basketball career he grew to 7ft 0in (2.13m). He began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA, but in Robinson's final two years he was a consensus All-American and won college basketball's two most prestigious player awards, the Naismith and Wooden Awards, as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former University of Georgia interim Head Coach Pete Herrmann. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the 1987 NBA draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to <b>wait</b> <b>two</b> years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy.|$|E
