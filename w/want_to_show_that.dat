500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe we could look to other commandments. So we thought, 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer {{had a lot of}} fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E

She also {{comments that}} she focuses more on the hand and the backs of male characters when she draws them because they [...] "can tell more about the character's feelings than the faces, so when I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> they are full of sadness or passion, I use that". Yamada comments that she uses the [...] "playmate version of model dolls" [...] (drawing models based on Playboy models) to draw Mitsuko Hane due to her [...] "big chest".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "anti-" [...] part {{of their}} {{critique}} of the Freudian Oedipal complex begins with that original model's articulation of society based on the family triangle of father, mother and child. Criticizing psychoanalysis [...] "familialism", they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the oedipal model of the family {{is a kind of}} organization that must colonize its members, repress their desires, and give them complexes if it is to function as an organizing principle of society. Instead of conceiving the [...] "family" [...] as a sphere contained by a larger [...] "social" [...] sphere, and giving a logical preeminence to the family triangle, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the family should be opened onto the social, as in Bergson's conception of the Open, and that underneath the pseudo-opposition between family (composed of personal subjects) and social, lies the relationship between pre-individual desire and social production.|$|E

2500|$|Genco Russo's once {{described}} {{his role in}} the community to the social activist Danilo Dolci. It provides an illustration of the self-image of the mafioso in the second, [...] "legitimate" [...] stage of his career - the mafioso as a public benefactor rather than as a dangerous criminal: [...] "It's in my nature. I have no ulterior motives. If I can do a man a favour, no matter who he is, I will; because that's how I'm made... I can't say 'no' to anyone. The trouble I'm put to is not so great that I have to refuse people in need... Very often warm-heartedness will win a man gratitude and friendship, and then the time comes to ask for one thing or another in... Folks come and ask how they should vote because they feel the need for advice. They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> they are grateful to those who have worked for their good; they want to thank them for what they've done by voting for them; but they are ignorant, and want to be told how to do it." ...|$|E

I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> invention, which was actually defined as an art in Edison's time--it was actually called the art of invention. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the inventive process, the creative process, they all stem from the--the--the deepest core of the imagination in--in a human being, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> connect all those creative processes {{in the context of an}} American vision." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How useful 'the poor' are," [...] remarked MacShaughnassy, {{somewhat}} abruptly, {{placing his}} feet on the mantelpiece, and tilting his chair back till it stood at an angle that caused us to rivet our attention upon it with hopeful interest. [...] "I don't think we scribbling fellows ever fully grasp how much we owe to 'the poor.' Where would our angelic heroines and our noble-hearted heroes be {{if it were not for}} 'the poor'? We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the dear girl is as good as she is beautiful. What do we do? We put a basket full of chickens and bottles of wine on her arm, a fetching little sun-bonnet on her head, and send her round among the poor. How do we prove that our apparent scamp of a hero is really a noble young man at heart? Why, by explaining that he is good to the poor.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't say I shall succeed," [...] Ferris answered. [...] "In fact I've {{made one}} failure already, and I'm pretty well {{on with a}} second; but the {{principle}} is right, all the same. I don't expect everybody to see the difference between Don Ippolito and Father O'Brien. At any rate, what I'm going to paint at is the lingering pagan in the man, the renunciation first of the inherited nature, and then of a personality that would have enjoyed the world. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> baffled aspiration, apathetic despair, and rebellious longing which you caten in his face When he's off his guard, and that suppressed look which is the characteristic expression of all Austrian Venice.

6000|$|Evidence! {{that was}} the {{stumbling}} block of anthropology. We still hear, in the later works of Mr. Max MÃ¼ller, the echo of the old complaints. Anything you please, Mr. Max MÃ¼ller says, you may find among your useful savages, and (in regard to some anthropologists) his criticism is just. You have but to skim a few books of travel, pencil in hand, and pick out what suits your case. Suppose, as regards our present theme, your theory is that savages possess broken lights of the belief in a Supreme Being. You can find evidence for that. Or suppose you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> they have no religious ideas at all; you can find evidence for that also. Your testimony is often derived from observers ignorant {{of the language of}} the people whom they talk about, or who are themselves prejudiced by one or other theory or bias. How can you pretend to raise a science on such foundations, especially as the savage informants wish to please or to mystify inquirers, or they answer at random, or deliberately conceal their most sacred institutions, or have never paid any attention to the subject? ...|$|E
6000|$|This polite epistle, {{it may be}} mentioned, was {{a revised}} version of the one which Drummond {{originally}} wrote in reply to Sheen's request. His first impulse had been to answer in the four brief words, [...] "Don't be a fool"; for Sheen's letter had struck him {{as nothing more than}} a contemptible piece of posing, and he had all the hatred for poses which is a characteristic of the plain and straightforward type of mind. It seemed to him that Sheen, as he expressed it to himself, was trying to [...] "do the boy hero". In the school library, which had been stocked during the dark ages, when that type of story was popular, there were numerous school stories in which the hero retrieved a rocky reputation by thrashing the bully, displaying in the encounter an intuitive but overwhelming skill with his fists. Drummond could not help feeling that Sheen must have been reading one of these stories. It was all very fine and noble of him to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> he was No Coward After All, like Leo Cholmondeley or whatever his beastly name was, in The Lads of St. Ethelberta's or some such piffling book; but, thought Drummond in his cold, practical way, what about the house? If Sheen thought that Seymour's was going to chuck away all chance of winning one of the inter-house events, simply in order to give him an opportunity of doing the Young Hero, the sooner he got rid of that sort of idea, the better. If he wanted to do the Leo Cholmondeley business, let him go and chuck a kid into the river, and jump in and save him. But he wasn't going to have the house let in for twenty Sheens.|$|E

60|$|That {{afternoon}} {{there came}} down to the parsonage a note from Mary to the Captain, asking her lover to meet her, and walk with her before dinner. He met her, and they took their accustomed stroll along the towing-path and into the fields. Mary had thought much of her aunt's words before the note was written, and had a fixed purpose of her own in view. It was true enough that though she loved this man with all her heart and soul, so loved him that she could not look forward to life apart from him without seeing that such life would be a great blank, yet she was aware that she hardly knew him. We are apt to suppose that love should follow personal acquaintance; and yet love at third sight is probably as common as any love at all, and it takes a great many sights before one human being can know another. Years are wanted to make a friendship, but days suffice for men and women to get married. Mary was, after a fashion, aware that she had been too quick in giving away her heart, and that now, when the gift had been made in full, it became her business to learn what sort of man was he to whom she had given it. And it was not only his nature as it affected her, but his nature as it affected himself that she must study. She did not doubt but that he was good, and true, and noble-minded; but it might be possible that a man good, true, and noble-minded, might have lived with so many indulgences around him as to be unable to achieve the constancy of heart which would be necessary for such a life as that which would be now before them if they married. She had told him that he should decide for himself and for her also,--thus throwing upon him the responsibility, and throwing upon him also, very probably, the necessity of a sacrifice. She had meant to be generous and trusting; but it might be that of all courses that which she had adopted was the least generous. In order that she might put this wrong right, if there were a wrong, she had asked him to come and walk with her. They met at the usual spot, and she put her hand through his arm with her accustomed smile, leaning upon him somewhat heavily for a minute, as girls do when they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> they claim the arm that they lean on as their own.|$|E
