40|$|The {{concept of}} work is studied in quantum thermostatistics of a system {{surrounded}} by an environment and driven by an external force. It is found that there emerges the gauge theoretical structure in a nonequilibrium process, the field of which {{is referred to as}} the <b>work</b> <b>gauge</b> field. The thermodynamic work as the flux of the <b>work</b> <b>gauge</b> field is considered for a cyclic process in the space of the external-force parameters. As an example, the system of a spin- 1 / 2 interacting with an external magnetic field is analyzed. This geometric effect may be observed, for example, in an NMR experiment and can be applied to the problem of cooling/heating of a small system. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 86 - 95) This thesis {{explores the}} ways in which Battlestar Galactica (2004 - 2009), a contemporary science fiction television series written in a postfeminist culture, both subverts and reinforces hegemonic power dynamics. Through a critical examination of classic science fiction conventions, one will see how the series becomes a commentary on reproduction, race, and violence. Furthermore the series' discourse on gender and nationalism, race and racialization, and women and violence offers compelling insight into debates over reproductive justice in the U. S. in the 21 st century. This analysis of primary source research focuses on the reimagined series in its entirety spanning from the 2003 NBC miniseries, 2004 - 2009 SyFy television series, and supplementary films and webisodes. As a show that presents itself as feminist, this <b>work</b> <b>gauges</b> responses to the series by self-defined feminist members of feminist fan communities through their participation in blogs where they have written articles on the series and responses to those articles through forums on the blogs themselves.
