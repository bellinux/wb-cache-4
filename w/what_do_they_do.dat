On the British black metal {{documentary}} [...] (2007), all interviewed musicians stated - {{when asked about the}} matter - that black metal cannot be Christian. The term [...] "Christian black metal" [...] drew mocking replies from the black metal musicians, for example Martin Walkyier of the English metal band Sabbat commented: [...] "'Christian black metal?' <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> Do they build churches? Do they repair them? (laughs)" [...] Jonathan Selzer, editor of the British metal magazine Terrorizer discussed his experiences and thoughts in the documentary: ...|$|E
2500|$|Macdonell insisted to {{his fellow}} reporters that [...] "the toughest {{decision}} for a sports writer to make {{was the one that}} would take him off his beat." [...] Explaining his love for sports writing, Macdonell once asked and answered this question while interviewing Hank Greenberg: [...] "When millionaires retire <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> [...] They go to big golf tournaments, visit Florida baseball camps, attend big prize fights and watch Davis Cup matches at Forest Hills. It is their idea of paradise, the ideal existence. A sports writer is even closer to the fun than an ordinary spectator. Why should he give up all that if his health is OK?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people." [...] As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the [...] "fringe benefits" [...] of the work.|$|E
5000|$|You see, {{everybody}} {{always talk}} about Hitler exterminating 6 million Jews...but don't nobody ever asked <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> to Hitler? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> to them folks? <b>They</b> went in there, in Germany, the way <b>they</b> <b>do</b> everywhere <b>they</b> go, and they supplanted, they usurped, they turned around, and a German, in his own country, would almost {{have to go to}} a Jew to get money. They had undermined the very fabric of the society.|$|R

6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> with themselves?" [...] Boduoc asked, puzzled. [...] "In such {{a country}} as this {{there can be}} few wild beasts. If men can neither fight nor hunt, how are they to employ their time? They must become a nation of women." ...|$|E

40|$|Lawyers {{negotiate}} regularly, but few {{ever take}} {{the time when they}} have completed such critical interactions to ask themselves how <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> If <b>they</b> hope to improve their bargaining capabilities, they should take a few minutes after their more significant interactions to ask themselves some basic questions. Were <b>they</b> thoroughly prepared, and <b>did</b> <b>they</b> establish elevated but realistic aspirations? How did the negotiation stages develop? <b>What</b> bargaining techniques <b>did</b> <b>they</b> employ, and how <b>did</b> <b>they</b> counteract the tactics used by the other side? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> that <b>they</b> wished <b>they</b> had not <b>done?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> not <b>do</b> that <b>they</b> should have <b>done?</b> Through such inquiries, attorneys can significantly enhance their bargaining skills...|$|R

6000|$|Saint Margaret's Bay is one {{of those}} small, quiet, secluded hamlets which are not unfrequently met with along our coasts, and in regard to which the {{stranger}} is irresistibly led to ask mentally, if not really, [...] "Why did people ever come to build cottages and dwell here, and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> How do they make a livelihood?" ...|$|E

6000|$|I felt {{a strange}} imbecility of mind, yet {{it seemed to}} anger me {{to be told that}} I was ill. [...] "I am not ill," [...] I protested feebly. [...] "I never felt better in my life!

6000|$|It {{has been}} shown that there are more men than there is work for men, and that the surplus labor army is an {{economic}} necessity. To show how the tramp is a by-product of this economic necessity, it is necessary to inquire into the composition of the surplus labor army. What men form it?

60|$|And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> those blessed beings? Whatever {{else they}} do, {{or do not}} do, this we are told they do--they worship. They satisfy, it would seem, in perfection, that mysterious {{instinct}} of devotion--that inborn craving to look upward and adore, which, let false philosophy say what it will, proves the most benighted idolater to be a man, and not a brute--a spirit, and not a merely natural thing.|$|E
60|$|And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> these blessed beings? They longed for, toiled for, {{it may be}} died for, the true, the beautiful, and the good; {{they entered}} while on earth into the mystery and glory of self-sacrifice, and now they find their bliss in gazing on the one perfect and eternal sacrifice, and rejoicing in the thought {{that it is the}} cause and ground of the whole universe, even the Lamb slain before the {{foundation}} of the world.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2010 {{a congressional}} {{investigation}} led by Miller asked the Navy and a contractor, Baker Environmental Inc., for {{documents related to}} the contamination issue.

[...] "There wasn't {{any need for}} any of them to get it if they'd only got out and <b>done</b> something. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> Growled and kicked and grouched at the cold, the long nights, the hardships, the aches and pains and {{everything}} else.

6000|$|... "All {{the more}} bother, perhaps, when {{the thing is}} brought home to us. There's no need for recriminations. The thing of moment is that we find {{ourselves}} in the position--not to put too fine a point upon it--of tramps in this admirable world. The question of all others of importance to us at present is <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> with their tramps?

6000|$|What do men meddle with {{religion}} for? Why {{do they call}} themselves {{by the name of}} the Lord Jesus, if they have not the grace of God, if they have not the Spirit of Christ? God, therefore, expecteth fruit. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in the vineyard? Let them work, or get them out; the vineyard must have labourers in it. 'Son, go WORK to-day in my vineyard' (Matt 21:28). Wherefore, want of grace and want of Spirit will not keep God from seeking fruit. 'And he came and sought fruit thereon' (Luke 13:6, 8:8). He requireth that which he seemeth to have. Every man in the vineyard and house of God promiseth himself, professeth to others, and would have all men take it for granted, that a heavenly principle is in him, why then should not God seek fruit? ...|$|E

And the only reason it was standing was because people were living in it. If we had let it go the way the city wanted it to go– they tore out the stairwell, they punched holes in the roof. The water– the rain was rotting that building from the inside out. We replaced the joists. We rebuilt the floors. We sheet rocked the walls and made the building alive. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> <b>They</b> killed it. That building is {{over a hundred years}} old.
