[...] "Everyone who was there would say that they got home because of Reg." [...] Another said: [...] "We were lucky to have Reg Newton and that is {{evidenced}} {{by the fact that the}} casualties in D Force were one of the lowest and it was definitely because of him." [...] His men realized his unorthodox measures gave them the best chance of survival.|$|E

"There {{are some}} stories, {{especially}} ones {{that occur in}} the bedroom, where mainstream media outlets sometimes can’t venture—or at least they can’t find it in themselves to lead the charge. But {{it would be hard to}} argue that the body politic is not enriched by the recent revelations that Mr. Edwards is not who <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> even balanced against the many stories the Enquirer gets wrong." [...] (Even in his confession, Mr. Edwards wrinkled his nose and suggested that the allegations had originated with [...] "supermarket tabloids", as if the method of conveyance absolved him of the deeds described.) ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{received}} scholarship {{offers from}} Michigan State, USC, Tennessee, Florida, and Iowa. Ringer was also heavily recruited by Ohio State, {{but did not}} receive a scholarship offer from the school. Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said “(We) were very interested. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a great player.” One article said the reason why Ringer wasn't given an offer is because OSU compared Ringer to Ryan Brewer, a high school standout from Troy, Ohio who OSU passed on. Brewer had a solid college career at South Carolina for Coach Lou Holtz and helped the Gamecocks beat Ohio State in the 2001 Outback Bowl. Ringer attended summer football camps at Ohio State during high school. One of them was 2004's NIKE Camp in Columbus, Ohio. During that camp, Ringer had a camp best shuttle run of a 3.87 seconds. He also had the best vertical leap that day with a jump of [...]|$|E

2500|$|At the 'Bloody Angle,' Spotsylvania, May 12th, our corps, the Sixth, {{supported}} the Second {{in the famous}} charge against [...] Johnson's Division of the Confederate Army. During the thickest of the fight, Lieutenant Wellman was badly wounded, and I was ordered {{to take him to}} the rear. It was about a mile to the hospital, and the shot and shell came so thick and fast that it was extremely hazardous to venture across with a wounded comrade, but I succeeded in carrying out the order, and after placing the lieutenant in the hospital, I came safely back through the fire. Upon reaching my company, Lieutenant Sparks congratulated me, saying: ' Tracy, I hope you will not have to cross that field on a like errand again.' Scarcely had he finished speaking, when a ball pierced his left breast and he fell into my arms. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mortally wounded, but discovering signs of life in him, decided {{to take him to the}} hospital, without waiting for orders.|$|E
2500|$|The 79th {{running of}} the Tokyo Yushun took place over 2400 metres on firm ground at Tokyo on 27 May. World Ace headed the betting from Gold Ship with Deep Brillante third choice on 7.5/1. The other runners {{included}} Grandezza, Just A Way, Alfredo, Fenomeno and Historical (Mainichi Hai Stakes). In the build-up to the race the colt's groom had praised his attitude and temperament saying [...] "He's so calm usually it's almost frightening. He doesn't need any babysitting whatsoever. He's an intelligent horse, and he always runs his heart out in races". After tracking the leaders Iwata sent the colt into third approaching the final turn before taking the lead 200 metres out. In an extremely tight finish Deep Brillante held on to win by a nose from Fenomeno, with Tosen Homareboshi, World Ace, Gold Ship and Cosmo Ozora close behind. Less than two lengths covered the first six finishers. After the race Iwata, who was winning {{the race for the}} first time, said [...] "Praise him not me. It was his guts that won it as he was completely empty at the finish. I have always thought he was the best horse in this generation so we trained him very hard to get a big success. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the best one and I am proud that we could prove it." ...|$|E

60|$|It was an unlucky v'y'ge that, {{for some}} of 'em. About a week arter pore Bill's {{accident}} Ted Jones started playing catch-ball with another chap and a empty beer-bottle, and about the fifth chuck Ted caught it with his face. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>'e</b> <b>was</b> killed at fust--he made such a noise; but they got 'im down below, and, arter they 'ad picked out as much broken glass as Ted would let 'em, the second officer did 'im up in sticking- plaster and told 'im to keep quiet {{for an hour or}} two.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing! What can I! There isn't {{anything}} to do anything about. If it's there, he knows it, and he's left it there because he didn't care what <b>we</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> just trying something. He's always treated me like a perfect--child. That's all there is of it, and you know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> crazy; but he wasn't, {{for that}} {{afternoon}} we sighted a great berg south of us, and we'd been running north, we thought, for days.

60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact he had, for once Bastin had begun really <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to die. Somehow we got him into his cabin, which opened off the saloon, and as he could drink nothing more, Bickley managed to inject morphia or some other {{compound}} into him, which made him insensible for a long while.|$|R
6000|$|... "But a good clergyman, probably? I'm {{interested}} in the case, of course, as his wife is my first-cousin. You will understand, however, that I know nothing of him. My father tried to be civil to him once, but Crawley wouldn't have it at all. <b>We</b> all <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mad then. I suppose he has done his duty in his parish?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The first officer, who {{searched his}} luggage, found nothing to {{identify}} John Caldwell, of London. Practically all his belongings had been made, or purchased, in Paris. Everything that bore an initial was marked either with a 'T' alone, or with 'J. C. T.' <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> traveling incognito under {{his first two}} names--the J.

60|$|But is he dying--or {{does the}} life of a nation wake again, as after sleep? Is he this droll, {{harmless}} thing he here depicts himself? And if not?

Stop rotting, you asses! Stettson major would have croaked if the Head hadn't done it. The Head might have died himself.

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> grieving at {{not going}} back to Eton, and Fulk was living in hopes of an answer to the letter he had written to Francis Dayman about it, but that was not all. One day--Christmas Eve it was--Mr. Cradock, on coming into the church to look at the holly wreaths, found Trevor {{kneeling}} on his father's gravestone in the pavement, sobbing as if his heart was breaking, and heard between the sobs a broken prayer about [...] "Forgive"--"don't let them do it"--"turn mother's heart." ...|$|E
50|$|During this time, {{a series}} of skilful mansion break-ins {{occurred}} along the East Coast, in which high values of silver were taken. These initially puzzled their investigators, as Detective Jack McGiness of the Philadelphia serious crime unit later explained:Suddenly {{there were all these}} burglaries that had Nordahl's modus operandi all over them. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> locked up, but then discovered that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not.|$|R

6000|$|... "What matters {{about his}} uniform, O'Grady?" [...] the others exclaimed. [...] "What {{we want to}} know <b>is</b> how <b>he</b> saved his life at Corunna, when <b>we</b> all <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> either killed or taken prisoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{laid his}} head back on the pillow and closed his weary eyes. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{composing}} himself to sleep. Stella tried to relieve him of the boy. [...] "No," [...] he whispered; [...] "I am only resting my eyes {{to look at him}} again." [...] We waited. The child stared at me, in infantine curiosity. His mother knelt at his side, and whispered in his ear. A bright smile irradiated his face; his clear brown eyes sparkled; he repeated the forgotten lesson of the bygone time, and called me once more, [...] "Uncle Ber'." ...|$|E
60|$|Dinner {{was very}} soon over, and Mr. Chip, {{who had been}} all the while joking Berry, and {{pressing}} him to eat, called him up into his study, to the great disappointment of us all, for <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to prevent the fight; but no such thing. The Reverend Edward Chip took Berry into his study, and poured him out two glasses of port-wine, which he made him take with a biscuit, and {{patted him on the}} back, and went off. I have no doubt he was longing, like all of us, to see the battle; but etiquette, you know, forbade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{we could}} not say <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> up to mischief, though we {{suspected}} it, so we gave him his supper, an' he spent the night with us. Nixt mornin' he bade us good-day, an' went off. Then Adam said he would go an' set beaver traps in a creek about a mile off. Bein' lazy that day, I said I'd lie {{a bit in the}} camp. So away he went. The camp was on a hill. I could see him all the way, and soon saw him in the water settin' his traps.|$|E
6000|$|Our spirits {{rose and}} the landlord's fell--at least <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> so; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> confused, at any rate, {{notwithstanding}} {{he had not}} understood a word that had <b>been</b> said. <b>He</b> glanced from the little pile of gold pieces to Blucher several times and then went out.

60|$|I {{could never}} {{make out what}} his age could be, nor could Jim Horscroft either. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an oldish man that looked young, and at others that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a youngish man who looked old. His brown, stiff, {{close-cropped}} hair needed no cropping at the top, where it thinned away to a shining curve. His skin too was intersected by a thousand fine wrinkles, lacing and interlacing, and was all burned, as I have already said, by the sun. Yet <b>he</b> <b>was</b> as lithe as a boy, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> as tough as whalebone, walking all day over the hills or rowing on the sea without turning a hair. On the whole <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> might <b>be</b> about forty or forty-five, though {{it was hard to}} see how he could have seen so much of life in the time. But one day we got talking of ages, and then he surprised us.|$|R
60|$|That was {{the most}} that I ever heard him confess of his past life, and he only {{shook his head and}} laughed when we tried to get {{something}} more out of him. There were times when <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> but a clever impostor; for what could a man of such influence and talents be loitering here in Berwickshire for? But one day there came an incident which showed us that he had indeed a history in the past.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know not}} what that may be. Witta {{had found him}} half dead among ice {{on the shores of}} Muscovy. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a devil. He crawled before us and brought food in a silver dish which these sea-wolves had robbed from some rich abbey, and Witta with his own hands gave us wine. He spoke a little in French, a little in South Saxon, and much in the Northman's tongue. We asked him to set us ashore, {{promising}} to pay him better ransom than he would get price if he sold us to the Moors--as once befell a knight of my acquaintance sailing from Flushing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gore suits Winthy, anyway," [...] he said, {{beginning}} to eat his biscuit. [...] "I met {{one of the}} deacons from Brother Peck's last parish, in Boston, yesterday. He asked me if we considered Brother Peck anyways peculiar in Hatboro', and when I said <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a little too luxurious, the deacon {{came out with a}} lot of things. The way Brother Peck behaved toward the needy in that last parish of his made it simply uninhabitable to the standard Christian. They had {{to get rid of him}} somehow--send him away or kill him. Of course the deacon said they didn't want to kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I'd {{seen him}} on Dalton Street with the {{children}} following him, and I saw him again that day of the funeral. Some of the girls I knew used to laugh at him. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> queer. And then, when you brought me to him that morning and {{he got up and}} treated me like a lady, I just couldn't stand it. I never felt so terrible in my life. I just wanted to die, right then and there. Something inside of me kept pressing and pressing, until I thought I would die. I knew what it was to hate myself, but I never hated myself as I have since then.|$|E
5000|$|... “A {{lot of us}} knew Vernon {{from being}} {{involved}} in real estate at that time…He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I'll never forget it. He said, 'We're {{going to start a}} bank.' And he said we'd each have to put up between $25,000 and $125,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he'd arranged {{for all of us to}} borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $80,000. Only seven of us didn't get up and walk out, but <b>we</b> still <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> crazy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then by {{all means}} go in and see him, sir. <b>We</b> have <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> fast sinking; but if the news you bring can rouse him into {{making an effort to}} live, he may yet recover. I will go in and give him a strong restorative, and tell him that you are here." ...|$|R
50|$|On a bend, {{we saw a}} rider, {{the tall}} Rostollan, making demented {{gestures}} and running {{back up the hill}} and shouting 'Roger has fallen! Roger has fallen!' It was impossible to stop on the gravelled toboggan on which we'd embarked. Nobody had seen Rivière disappear. For five minutes, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> vaporised, purely and simply crossed off the map of the world, of which the immense and chaotic landscape around us gave the scale. Well, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> lying 20 or so metres below with a broken spine that forbade him the slightest gesture, the least call. His head was resting on a bed of rocks, his eyes open to the mountainous (rugueuse) countryside that surrounded him.|$|R
