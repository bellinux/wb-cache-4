2500|$|Reports at {{the time}} of Boorda's suicide {{indicated}} that his wearing of the two Combat [...] "V"'s on the two service ribbons had not been an intentional deception on his part, but had been an unintentional mistake that resulted from his following verbal instructions delivered to commanders during the Vietnam War by Admiral Elmo Zumwalt when he was Chief of Naval Operations, as well as conflicting interpretations and updating of Navy award regulations.

You mind just a few little things like that, Hoopdriver, and nothing much can't happen to you--you take my word." ...|$|R
2500|$|Pentangle {{are often}} characterised as a folk-rock band. Danny Thompson {{preferred}} {{to describe the}} group as a [...] "folk-jazz band." [...] John Renbourn also rejected the [...] "folk-rock" [...] categorisation, saying, [...] "One of the <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do to a folk song is inflict a rock beat on it[...] [...] Most of the old songs that I have heard have their own internal rhythm. When we worked on those in the group, Terry Cox worked out his percussion patterns to match the patterns in the songs exactly. In that respect he was the opposite of a folk-rock drummer." [...] This approach to songs led to the use of unusual time signatures: [...] "Market Song" [...] from Sweet Child moves from 7/4 to 11/4 and 4/4 time, and [...] "Light Flight" [...] from Basket of Light includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4.|$|R

In a month, no doubt, {{you will be able}} to sit a horse; but I should say that it would be quite twice that time, before you will be fit to perform the work that falls to your lot on the king's staff. You want to have quiet, and at the same time you need {{pleasant}} company. The <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly do is to worry and fret yourself. Instead of bringing things about sooner, it will only delay them. What you have to do is to bask in the sun, eat and drink as much as you can, and take life pleasantly.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Erwin entered {{about the}} {{completion}} of her preparations, and without turning round from her glass she said, [...] "I {{want you to think}} of the <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> Henshaw. I don't see how I'm ever to lift up my head again." [...] As if this word had reminded her of her head, she turned it from side to side, and got the effect in the glass, first of one ear-ring, and then of the other. Her husband patiently waited, and she now confronted him. [...] "You may as well know first as last, Henshaw, and I want you to prepare yourself for it. Nothing can be done, and you will just have to live through it. Lydia--has come over--on that ship--alone,--with three young men,--and not the shadow--not the ghost--of another woman--on board!" [...] Mrs. Erwin gesticulated with her hand-glass in delivering the words, in a manner at once intensely vivid and intensely solemn, yet somehow falling short of the due tragic effect. Her husband stood pulling his mustache straight down, while his wife turned again to the mirror, and put the final touches to her personal appearance with hands which she had the effect of having desperately washed of all responsibility. He stood so long in this meditative mood that she was obliged to be peremptory with his image in the glass. [...] "Well?" [...] she cried.|$|E
