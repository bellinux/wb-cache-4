40|$|The {{central theme}} of this book is the interplay of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>employment</b> and the {{macro-economy}} in postwar Germany and Japan. David Kucera introduces the distinction between two possible types of flexibility in the labor market. The first occurs {{in the absence of}} interference with the market mechanism from laws or institutions. This flexibility may reduce unemployment and increase the response time to shocks, at the cost of low wages and insufficient training. In the second type of flexibility, a buffer group provides this flexibility, while core workers are protected from the vagaries of the market and receive training and high wages. Kucera argues that by using women as a buffer group to protect men, Japan is able at a macro-level to reap the benefits of both the low-road and high-road approaches. Bolstering this argument, and showing that Germany pursues instead the simpler high-road strategy, is the most important aim of the book. ...|$|E
40|$|Violence against {{children}} and women {{is a serious}} public health and human rights problem. In low income countries it {{is closely related to}} poverty and culture with major social consequences and economic burden for the families. The overall objective was to study the specific circumstances of domestic violence, including the child labour s situation and to develop a cost of violence model adjusted for the burden of families. The studies were performed in four countries. In the first study violent behaviour was analysed among 1, 400 child labourers divided into fourteen categories of work in five states of India (Paper I). In the short term perspective child labourers become violent, aggressive, and criminal, following a pyramid of violent behaviour, including cultural deviance, and socio-economic and psychological pressure. When considering family history, it seems that the problem is part of a vicious cycle of violence, which persists through generations and evolves through financial crisis, early marriage, and violence in the family. Of interest was also the problem of maternal abuse of children and mothers exposure to and attitudes towards intimate partner violence (Paper II). Nationally representative data of 14, 016 married women from the Egyptian Demographic and Health Survey of 2005 were used. Less exposure to physical IPV was associated with lower risk of using violent methods, such as shouting, striking, or slapping, to correct child behaviour. Non-tolerant attitudes towards IPV were also associated with using the explanation method to the children. The current situation of domestic violence against women in rural Bangladesh was studied using a cross sectional household survey of 4, 411 married women (Paper III). Illiteracy, alcoholic misuse, dowry, husband s monetary greed from parent-in laws and wife s doubt on husband s extra marital affairs were the risk factors for verbal, physical and sustenance abuse. The social inequalities in intimate partner violence (IPV) was scrutinised in Kenya among 3, 696 women of reproductive age (Paper IV). The data were collected from the Kenyan demographic and health survey of 2003. <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>employment</b> and having a higher education/occupational status than her partner, age differences between the partners, illiteracy, lack of autonomy and access to information increased their exposure to IPV. A cost of injury study based on an adjusted model for low-income countries was tested using case studies in India (Paper V). The model comprised 32 cost elements divided into four main categories: injury, death, deprivation and other costs including encompassing and socioeconomic data and family characteristics. The main cost elements were income adjusted by family and years, income impact on the family, costs of physical, psychosocial and family deprivations, and a cardinal approach to productivity loss. As a result of the case studies, the supplementary variables contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the total burden of families. Poverty, illiteracy, male dominancy in resource control and social acceptance of violence make children and women more vulnerable to violence. The problem persists over generations and results in an economic burden on the families for healthcare and disability. The studies confirm the need for long term local safety promotion programs supported by national policy and legislation addressing the most vulnerable groups in developing countries...|$|E

Part III of this article proposes that U.

40|$|Modern {{societies}} are characterised by profound changes in both {{working conditions and}} family formation. Today s workplaces are marked by high flexibility, great job instability and variable working hours. A dual-earner family has replaced the traditional male-breadwinner family and the norm is two working adults. However, the pattern of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> involvement in <b>employment</b> differs in all labour markets depending on the gendered division of paid work, unpaid work and care obligations. These differences {{can be seen as}} the combined effect of the individual household strategies and the shape of family and labour market policies in the European welfare regimes. The article analyses household strategies in combining paid work, unpaid work and care in four European countries Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The main conclusion is that the division of paid work, unpaid work as well as caring obligations is gendered in all four countries. Compared with women, men tend to be more flexible, have more secure positions in the labour market and seem to be more involved in unpaid voluntary activities and seem thus more integrated in the society and have a higher level of civic participation. On the other hand, today, an increasing number of women are fully active in the labour market and their level of participation in civic activities becomes more and more similar to men s. However, the burdens of caring for children and other members of the household are still very unevenly divided between men and women, which makes the conflicts between obligations at work and in the households significantly more troublesome for women than for men. ...|$|R

40|$|Quite {{early in}} the 1990 s, {{concerns}} were expressed for the situation {{of women in the}} post-socialist countries in Eastern Europe, in particular with regards to access to the labour market. As the former regime had been committed to the full employment of both men and women, it seemed obvious that women would lose out in the competition in new labour markets. In addition, social provision designed to alleviate the conflict between work and family deteriorated. In most research from the early and mid 1990 s, one of the central presumptions was that women {{would be the first to}} become unemployed, and would as a consequence of this be the losers of the transition. In the latter half of the 1990 s, case studies emerged showing the surprising result that women, as compared to men, had not been pushed out of the labour market, in several of the countries in question. It was suggested that women had retained their relatively strong position in the labour market due to the nature of economic restructuring, which hit hardest in the male dominated parts of the industry, in addition to a growth in typically female occupations in the service sector. This dissertation aims to illuminate some further possible explanations for <b>women</b> <b>s</b> stronger than expected position in the labour market through an explorative study of the Latvian case. In addition to the opportunity for <b>women</b> <b>s</b> continued <b>employment,</b> as argued in former studies, the dissertation examines the relationship between work and family, and family change, in particular falling fertility rates as a potential contributing factor in sustaining <b>women</b> <b>s</b> high level of participation in the labour market. Dramatically falling fertility rates have been a trait in most of the post-socialist countries. This study focuses on women in Latvia as actors choosing between the two arenas of work and family in where to invest their time, within structural constraints. The study first deals with the opportunity structure in Latvia with regards to access to the labour market and the combination of work and family. Changes in the labour market are shown to be similar to what has been identified in other East European countries. Restructuring did initially hit hardest in men s jobs, reflected in the higher unemployment rates of men in the early and mid 1990 s. Further, the largest growth in employment sectors has been in service occupations, creating many jobs that are seen as typically feminine. State provision for families with children is also examined. A concern in former research on Eastern Europe was that the closing of kindergartens in particular would make work and family harder to combine. While this has also been the case in Latvia, the decline in provision of financial resources through family benefits, combined with low wage levels, has increased the necessity for women to work at a paid job, as most families cannot live on a single salary. Consequently, the opportunities for most women to choose a home-based existence are scarce. At the individual level, the necessity to work is reflected in the high labour force participation and employment rates of women, which are very similar to those of men. It is further shown that women work predominantly full time, and that this is also the case for women with children. This indicates that adjustments are not mainly made in the labour market to accommodate the conflicting demands of work and family on time. Finally, it is argued that <b>women</b> <b>s</b> relatively strong position in the labour market can be seen in connection with the falling fertility rates in Latvia in the 1990 s. Many people have chosen to postpone or forego having children, as birth numbers and birth rates have declined by half during the decade. This means that there has been a substantial decline in the number of women with small children, and consequently fewer women who confront the conflict between work and family. As a result there are also fewer people who compete over the use of public childcare facilities. This is reflected in a large increase in the share of children attending kindergartens from 1994 to 1999, entirely accounted for by the drop in birth numbers. Falling fertility rates may thus be taken as strengthening <b>women</b> <b>s</b> opportunity to enter into the labour market at the aggregate level. On background of the processes outlined above it is suggested that the economic and political processes initially believed to cause women to drop out of the labour market in favour of a traditional housewife role, have in fact been more influential in family change, in particular in terms of falling fertility rates. This, in addition to the characteristics of economic restructuring, may have contributed to <b>women</b> <b>s</b> relatively high participations rates in the labour market...|$|R

Between 2000 and 2007, the economy gave back the {{considerable}} gains in employment rates it had achieved during the 1990 s, with major contractions in manufacturing employment being a prime {{contributor to the}} slump. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>employment</b> "sag" of the 2000 s is widely recognized but poorly understood. In this paper, we explore {{the contribution of the}} swift rise of import competition from China to sluggish U. <b>S.</b> <b>employment</b> growth. We find that the increase in U. S. imports from China, which accelerated after 2000, was a major force behind recent reductions in U. <b>S.</b> manufacturing <b>employment</b> and that, through input-output linkages and other general equilibrium effects, it appears to have significantly suppressed overall U. S. job growth. We apply industry-level and local labor market-level approaches to estimate the size of (a) employment losses in directly exposed manufacturing industries, (b) employment effects in indirectly exposed upstream and downstream industries inside and outside manufacturing, and (c) the net effects of conventional labor reallocation, which should raise employment in non-exposed sectors, and Keynesian multipliers, which should reduce employment in non-exposed sectors. Our central estimates suggest net job losses of 2. 0 to 2. 4 million stemming from the rise in import competition from China over the period 1999 to 2011. The estimated employment effects are larger in magnitude at the local labor market level, consistent with local general equilibrium effects that amplify the impact of import competition...|$|R
