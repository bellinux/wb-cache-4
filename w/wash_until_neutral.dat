40|$|Chitin {{is natural}} polymer which used in biomedic sector mainly for injury healing, suture and dietery because chitin has antibacterial, {{antifungal}} and antiviral properties. Chitin content in natural material can be isolated using deproteinasi and demineralization process. This research objection {{is to determine}} demineralization reaction kinetics in chitin isolation with temperature and shrimp shell powder to HCl solution ratio. This research is started with 50 gr shrimp shell powder with 1 N HCl solution then heated with temperature such as 40 °C and shrimp shell powder to HCl solution ratio such as 1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 15 and 1 : 20 (gr/ml). Sample is taken with time interval 5, 10 and 15 minutes as much as 20 ml and <b>washed</b> <b>until</b> <b>neutral</b> pH. Next, sample is filtered using filter paper and then the solid part is analyzed in complexometry titration. Research result shows that reaction kinetics following pseudo second order and increasing of k value {{in a row of}} temperature increase is 0, 00002 menit- 1.

The synthesized of chitin from ebi 2 ̆ 7 s waste by deproteinization and demineralization process was investigated. The aims {{of this research}} is to determine the reaction kinetics of demineralization at isolation of chitin with variables of concentration of HCl and stirring rate. The research was started by mixing ebi 2 ̆ 7 s waste powder with HCl concentration of 0, 2 N; 0, 6 N; 1 N; 1, 4 N; and 1, 8 N at temperature 29 °C and the stirring rate 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 rpm in the beaker glass and completely with stirrer.

40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} the capability {{and efficiency of}} the absorption of coconut-shell carbon powder and market carbon powder of Ni metal in electroplating industrial waste. Part of each carbon powder was activated to determine the capability and efficiency of absorption of each carbon powder. The first process of the activated carbon manufacture was by carbonizing each material followed by milling and enriching up {{to the size of}} 100. Chemical activation process was done by soaking the carbons in phosphoric acid of 60 % for 24 hours and then <b>washed</b> with water <b>until</b> <b>neutral</b> and then dried. The physical activation process was done by heating at the temperature of 150 °C for 60 minutes each activated carbon and not activated carbon by the mass variations of 5 grams, 15 grams, 25 grams, 35 grams, and 45 grams in order to absorb Ni metal in electroplating waste. The supernatant, then, was analyzed by using AAS so that it could be seen the absorption capability. The research results showed that the efficiency of coconut shell activated carbon absorption was greater from 21. 8 % to 33. 4 %, while the base carbon was activated from 13. 8 % to 26. 6 %. This showed that the activated coconut shell carbons were better than activated base carbons.

40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of Sangiran diatomaceous earth {{pre-treatment}} with sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) on the kinetics of adsorption for Cr(III) in aqueous solution has been studied. The research {{has been carried out}} by mixing an amount of diatomeaeous earth with HCl or H 2 SO 4 in various concentrations for two hours at temperature of 150 - 200 °C. The mixture was <b>washed</b> with water <b>until</b> <b>neutral,</b> and the residue was dried at 70 °C for four hours. The result then was used as adsorbent. Adsorption was carried out by mixing an amount of adsorbent with Cr(III) solution in various contact times. Ion adsorbed was determined by analyzing filtrate using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The effect of pre-treatment on adsorption kinetics was evaluated based on kinetic parameters, i. e. constant of adsorption rate by using Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics and using two-process kinetics (fast and slow processes). Adsorption kinetics calculated using LH equation gave negative value for adsorption rate constant of zero order (k 0). On the other words, the LH kinetics might not be applied for adsorption of Cr(III) to diatomaceous earth adsorbent. Results of kinetics study approached using two processes (fast and slow) showed that adsorption of Cr(III) occurred in two processes with rate constant of fast adsorption, kc, 0. 041 /min, rate constant of slow adsorption, kl, 0. 0089 /min, and of slow desorption, k'l, 0. 089 /menit. Pre-treatment with HCl up to 10 M decreased either kc, kl or k'l, while pre-treatment with H 2 SO 4 1 M increased kc to 0. 061 /min, decreased kl to 0. 00424 and k'l to 0. 0139 /min. On pre-treatment with H 2 SO 4 higher than 6 M significantly decreased three constants above. Based on the Gibbs energy change (4. 31 - 6. 79 kJ/mole) showed that adsorption involved physical interaction.   Keywords: adsorption, chromium, diatomaceous earth, kinetics, Langmuir-Hinshelwoo...|$|R

Similar phenomena are obtained when bacteria or collodion particles are mixed with diluted serum (antigen) and precipitin added; the particles or bacteria agglutinate and increase the visibility of the reaction.
