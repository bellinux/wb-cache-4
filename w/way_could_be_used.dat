40|$|Abstract. This paper {{suggests}} a methodology which is aimed {{to extract the}} terminologically relevant collocations for translation purposes. Our basic idea {{is to use a}} hybrid method which combines the statistical method and linguistic rules. The extraction system used in our work operated at three steps: (1) Tokenization and POS tagging of the corpus; (2) Extraction of multi-word units using statistical measure; (3) Linguistic filtering to make use of syntactic patterns and stop-word list. As a result, hybrid method using linguistic filters proved to be a suitable method for selecting terminological collocations, it has considerably improved the precision of the extraction which is much higher than that of purely statistical method. In our test, hybrid method combining “Log-likelihood ratio ” and “linguistic rules ” had the best performance in the extraction. We believe that terminological collocations and phrases extracted in this <b>way,</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> effectively either to supplement existing terminological collections or to be used in addition to traditional reference works. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{model that}} {{describes}} operation of dynamo in fully convective stars is presented. It {{is based on}} representation of stellar magnetic field as a superposition of finite number of poloidal and toroidal free damping modes. In the frame of adopted low of stellar differential rotation we estimated minimal value of dynamo number D, starting from which generation of cyclic magnetic field in stars without radiative core is possible. We also derived expression for period of the cycle. It was found that dynamo cycles of fully convective stars and stars with thin convective envelopes differ in a qualitative way: 1) distribution of spots over latitude during the cycle is different in these stars; 2) the model predicts that spot formation in fully convective stars should be strongly suppressed at some phases of the cycle. We have analyzed historical lightcurve of WTTS star V 410 Tau and found that long term activity of the star is not periodic process. Rather one can speak about quasi cyclic activity with characteristic time of ∼ 4 yr and chaotic component over imposed. We concluded also that redistribution of cool spots over longitude is the reason of long term variations of V 410 Tau brightness. It means {{that one can not}} compare directly results of photometric observations with predictions of our axially symmetric (for simplicity) model which allows to investigate time evolution of spot's distribution over latitude. We then discuss what kind of observations and in which <b>way</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to check predictions of the dynamo theory. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures, accepted to Astron.

40|$|Wave {{exposure}} plays a {{major role}} in shaping the ecological structure of nearshore communities, with different community types able to survive and/or thrive when typically exposed to different levels of wave energy. This can be quantified by taking direct field measurements with wave buoys over time and then manipulating the data to derive typical conditions. However, taking these measurements is only feasible for very limited areas due to logistical constraints, and generating them with numerical wave models can also be expensive to run and may require data inputs that are either lacking or are highly uncertain. Instead, the relative differences in wave exposure between places (relative wave exposure) may be sufficient to distinguish between different community types. It is possible to approximate relative wave exposure using a cartographic approach. Typically this involves measuring the relative shelter or openness of a particular location based on the distances from it to the nearest potential wave blocking obstacle in all directions with provides an approximation of fetch. Given that dominant wind speed and direction data is available for a particular site, these fetch distances can be manipulated to estimate the potential wave climate at that site, with some models going as far as to link this to linear wave theory in order to calculate wave power. This works because the extent to which large waves can form, and to which seas are ‘fully developed’, is constrained by wind velocity, time and fetch. Mapping relative wave exposure in this relatively simple <b>way</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to predict the spatial distribution of broad categories of ecological community types, especially where this information is difficult to collect using more direct methods. Despite its relative efficiency and simplicity, running a cartographic-based relative exposure model for more than a local study area quickly becomes computationally intensive, which drives the need to set up the model to run as quickly as possible while minimizing the risk of not detecting potential wave blocking obstacles, and thus underestimating the wave exposure. Yet surprisingly, no studies have tested the sensitivity of the relative wave exposure estimates that these models produce to variation in how key factors, such as the density of points from which fetch distances are measured (point spacing), the angle increment at which the fetch lines are drawn around each point (fetch angle spacing), and the adjustment of fetch line lengths based on bathymetry, are set in the model. This paper presents a preliminary analysis that shows the extent to which estimated relative wave exposure changed when the above model settings were varied for four case study areas within the Great Barrier Reef selected for their characteristic spatial arrangement (number and density) of obstacles. This was done using a new GIS-based generic model for estimating relative wave exposure (GREMO) which integrates many existing techniques into a single modeling platfor...|$|E

40|$|The steroid glucuronides estrone glucuronide and pregnanediol glucuronide were {{synthesised}} {{using the}} O-glycosylation reaction of a glycosyl donor {{with the appropriate}} steroid under standard Koenigs-Knorr conditions. X-ray crystallographic studies showed that the synthetic estrone glucuronide molecule had the correct stereochemistry. Estrone glucuronide and pregnanediol glucuronide conjugates of hen egg white lysozyme were prepared by both the mixed anhydride and active ester coupling procedures. Both methods gave good yields of conjugate but the active ester procedure gave a more diverse range of products. Unreacted lysozyme, which was present in all cases, was removed {{by a combination of}} cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography to give purified conjugate material whose lytic activity was inhibited by over 90 % in the presence of excess anti-steroid glucuronide antibody. Steroid glucuronide-lysozyme conjugates purified in this <b>way</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system to measure the levels of urinary estrone and pregnanediol glucuronide encountered in a normal menstrual cycle. Chromatography of the conjugation reaction mixtures on an S-Sepharose (fast flow) column in the presence of 7 M urea allowed the isolation of the different conjugate products. Conjugation of lysozyme with estrone glucuronide by the mixed anhydride method gave one major derivative exclusively acylated at lysine residue 33 while acylation with pregnanediol glucuronide gave two major derivatives exclusively acylated at lysine residues 33 and 97 respectively. On the other hand, conjugation of lysozyme with the two steroid glucuronides by the active ester method gave six derivatives which were acylated at combinations of one or more of three lysine residues, 33, 97, and 116. The correlation of the protein environments of the lysine amino groups in the crystal structure of lysozyme with the acylation positions in the conjugate families suggested that these positions were determined not only by the surface accessibility and nucleophilicity of the lysine residues but also by the steroid glucuronide and the acylating reagent. Computer derived three dimensional structures of the estrone glucuronide- lysozyme and pregnanediol glucuronide-lysozyme conjugates suggested that the enzyme conjugate may be inactivated by the antibody in the immune complex by either providing a physical barrier to approach by the large bacterial substrate or by disrupting the binding of the bacterial cell wall polymer into the active site cleft. The lytic activity of the estrone glucuronide-lysozyme E 3 conjugate was not inhibited in the presence of excess antibody when the small chitohexaose substrate was used, implying that the substrate could access the active site even when the conjugate was bound by antibody. The detailed characterisation of the mixed anhydride estrone glucuronide-lysozyme conjugate coupled with the current knowledge of the antigenic determinants of hen egg white lysozyme has made it possible to design, in principle, a novel sandwich solid phase immunoassay format for the measurement of estrone glucuronide levels...|$|E
