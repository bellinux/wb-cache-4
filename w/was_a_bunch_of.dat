Buck had just bought the instrument and was attempting {{to learn how to}} play it, recording the music as he practiced. Buck said that [...] "when I listened back to it the next day, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> stuff that was really just me learning how to play mandolin, and then there's what became 'Losing My Religion', and then a whole bunch more of me learning to play the mandolin." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Brendan Malloy. It premiered on February 23, 2010, on Vevo. Both members of 3OH!3 make an appearance in the video. Kesha told MTV that the video primarily involves men (described as [...] "douchey") hitting on Kesha, while she declines their advances. [...] "At one point," [...] Kesha says [...] "I get to be strapped to this harness and bouncing around everywhere, {{and it was really}} cool [...] The whole concept of the video <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> douche-y guys macking on me as usual, and me making them eat their toupees or other various items". Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard said that the clip was [...] "thoroughly entertaining".|$|E
500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, Marquee Moon was a post-punk album, while Jason Heller from The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "elegantly jagged" [...] art punk. Robert Christgau regarded it {{as more of a}} rock record because of Television's formal and technical abilities as musicians: [...] "It wasn't punk. Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts." [...] Both sides of the album began with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazines Evan Chakroff said veered between progressive rock and post-punk styles. The title track and [...] "Torn Curtain" [...] were longer and more jam-oriented. [...] "As peculiar as it sounds, I've always thought that we were a pop band", Verlaine later told Select. [...] "You know, I always thought Marquee Moon <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> cool singles. And then I'd realise, Christ, [...] is ten minutes long. With two guitar solos." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated [...] "There was never any fight between us, that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> bullshit created by the media. I mean I think they're a good band. Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all means nothing to me. Those guys in the band are nice people and there's no fight." [...] At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, the band also notably covered {{a portion of the}} Chuck Mosley-era song [...] "We Care a Lot".|$|E

After one long cross-country skiing exercise over the mountains the soldiers went, still on skis, straight to the Jerome where Laurence Elisha, then the owner, let them spend the night and offered them free drinks. Many were struck by the vintage decor. [...] "The only thing missing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> trail-worn cowboys or dirt-stained miners bellied up to the bar", one observed. Throughout their training, Elisha offered them a room and a steak dinner for a dollar a night.

2500|$|Godfrey's {{father was}} {{something}} of a [...] "free thinker" [...] {{by the standards of the}} era. [...] He did not disdain organized religion but insisted that his children explore all faiths before deciding for themselves which to embrace. Their childhood friends included Catholic, Jewish and every kind of Protestant playmates. The senior Godfrey was friends with the Vanderbilts, but was as likely to spend his time talking with the shoeshine man or the hotdog vendor about issues of the day. [...] In the book, Genius in the Family (G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1962), written about their mother by Godfrey's youngest sister, Dorothy Gene (who preferred to be called [...] "Jean"), with the help of their sister, Kathy, it was reported that the angriest they ever saw their father was when a man on the ferry declared the Ku Klux Klan a civic organization vital to the good of the community. They rode the ferry back and forth three times, with their father arguing with the man that the Klan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Blasted, bigoted fools, led 'round by the nose!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Abbott {{brothers}} officially {{broke up}} Pantera in 2003, also {{the year when}} their [...] was released (on September 23), when the Abbott brothers concluded that Anselmo had abandoned Pantera and would not return. The break-up of the band was not amicable and subsequently a war of words was waged between the former bandmates via the heavy metal and musical press. The Abbott brothers and Pantera crew members claimed that they tried numerous times to contact Anselmo over the phone to reorganize Pantera, but Anselmo maintains that they never called him. Caught up in the torrent was Rex Brown, who later said [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> he said, she said nonsense that was going on, and I wasn't {{going to get in}} the middle of it." [...] Anselmo's comment in a 2004 issue of Metal Hammer magazine saying that [...] "Dimebag deserves to be beaten severely" [...] typified Pantera's internal conflicts; Anselmo insists that this comment was tongue-in-cheek, and he was angered his comment ended up {{on the cover of the}} [...] "god damn" [...] magazine. This explanation was soon dismissed by Vinnie Paul, who said shortly after the 2004 murder of his brother that he had personally listened to the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted or misrepresented, but said the exact words which appeared in the article. In July 2004, Vulgar Display of Power went double-platinum, and The Great Southern Trendkill went platinum the next month.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Morrison {{recalled}} that he recorded the songs about {{four weeks after}} writing them: [...] "Veedon Fleece <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> songs that I wrote and then I just recorded it about four weeks after I wrote it. [...] When you make an album you write some songs; you might have four songs and maybe you write two more, suddenly you've got enough songs for an album." [...] According to the drummer Dahaud Shaar, the tracks were laid down in a very informal manner: [...] "During that time I kinda haunted the studio, and Van {{would come in and}} we'd just do tracks." [...] David Hayes recalled about the recording sessions: [...] "Every night for about a week he came in with two or three new tunes and we just started playing with him." [...] Jim Rothermel also {{recalled that}} during the California recording sessions for the album the songs were often a first take and that the band members had sometimes not heard the songs previously. The strings and woodwinds were arranged by Jef Labes in a New York studio. [...] The song [...] "Come Here My Love" [...] was inspired during the week of the sessions and another song [...] "Country Fair" [...] was left over from the Hard Nose the Highway album [...] and provided a fitting sense of closure. [...] "Bulbs" [...] and [...] "Cul de Sac" [...] were recut in New York later with musicians with whom Morrison had never worked before: guitarist John Tropea, bassist Joe Macho and drummer Allen Schwarzberg. Given a rock music treatment, these songs were [...] released as the single for the album." ...|$|E
