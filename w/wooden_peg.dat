5|$|The {{locations}} are themed around {{the idea of}} a traditional Southern U.S. general store. Items used to decorate each store are authentic artifacts, including everyday objects from the early 1900s and after. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> solitaire game on every table, and a stone fireplace with a deer head displayed above the mantel. In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and a traffic light. The peg games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee. The decor at each location typically includes artifacts related to the local history of the area, including antique household tools, old wall calendars and advertising posters, and antique photographs; these are centrally stored in a warehouse in Tennessee, where they are cataloged and stockpiled for future use by individual store locations.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, The Son confronts Kristen {{and tells}} her that by killing Mulder and {{drinking}} {{the blood of}} a [...] "believer", she will become one of them. Kristen approaches Mulder with a knife but instead stabs The Father, who is hiding in the bedroom. The Son attacks Mulder but is subdued. Mulder and Kristen try to escape using a car parked in the garage, but the Unholy Spirit jumps onto the car hood and attacks them. Kristen drives into her, impaling her on a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> on the wall. Kristen tricks Mulder into running outside of the house while she goes back inside and pours gasoline around herself and The Son. Kristen lights a match, blowing up the house and taking her own life in order to kill the other vampires. Firefighters and police find four bodies in the wreckage while Mulder stares at Scully's cross necklace.|$|E

2500|$|Later, in October 1862, the {{regiment}} would draw new uniforms upon {{their return to}} Knoxville, Tennessee, after the disastrous Kentucky Campaign. Matthews describes: [...] "woolen gray jeans, jacket lined with white cotton sheathing with four C.S.A. brass buttons, a pair of unlined gray jeans pants, a while cotton sheeting shirt and drawers, and white cotton machine-knit [...] socks and pair of rough tan brogans, hand-made <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> shoes...

2500|$|Inside {{the south}} porch is a wicket door, {{the only known}} one in an American colonial church. It {{consists}} of five vertical sections and three horizontal sections each divided by battens. [...] The smaller door is located within the middle three battens vertically and the central one horizontally. Cyma reversa mouldings are used on the battens. In the 1960s, {{the area around the}} doorway’s segmental arch was covered with a layer of plaster. [...] The doorway’s wooden molding is of a cyma reversa, reverse S, curve. On the hinge side is a large <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> that keeps the upper hinge from pulling out of the frame. The hinges consist of thick pintles at {{the top and bottom of}} the left side of the door. The door is said to weigh 1,000 pounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} cunning folk {{locating}} criminals using magical means concerned {{some people in}} power in England, and there are records from London in the fourteenth century showing that certain cunning folk themselves were brought to trial because of their accusations against {{other members of the}} community: for instance, in 1382 a cunning man named Robert Berewold was brought to court after accusing a woman named Johanna Wolsy of stealing a drinking bowl from a house in St Mildred Poultry. In the trial, it emerged that Berewold had come to his conclusion through a form of divination known as [...] "turning the loaf" [...] where a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> was stuck into the top of a loaf of bread with four knives then stuck into the sides. A list of names would then be spoken, and according to the theory, the loaf would supposedly turn when the name of the thief was spoken. Berewold was found guilty of making unsubstantiated and damaging claims, and punished in the pillory.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} as a five-bay Greek Revival raised {{plantation}} house, with wood frame built of virgin cypress joined by mortises and pinned with <b>wooden</b> <b>pegs.</b> It had a front gallery and a hip roof. All doors and window sashes were cut on site and assembled with <b>wooden</b> <b>pegs.</b> It included five 17 x 20 ft rooms and a 12 x 35 ft central hall, with 15 ft ceilings. It had front and rear galleries plus a separated kitchen.|$|R

50|$|Loimulohi or loimutettu lohi (Finnish lit. “blazed salmon”) is a Finnish fish preparation, {{in which}} salmon (or rainbow trout) is nailed to a plank with <b>wooden</b> <b>pegs</b> and cooked over the {{radiated}} heat {{from an open}} fire. <b>Wooden</b> <b>pegs</b> are used instead of regular nails because if used, the regular nails would get too hot and sear the meat around them, and in worst case the fish could fall to the ground. The planks are positioned vertically {{around the edge of}} the fire at an angle. Loimulohi has also been served as street food.|$|R
60|$|Curepipe (means Pincushion or Pegtown, probably). Sixteen miles (two hours) by rail from Port Louis. At {{each end}} of every roof and on the apex of every dormer window a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> two feet high stands up; in some cases its top is blunt, in others the peg is sharp and looks like a toothpick. The passion for this humble {{ornament}} is universal.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] Charley {{hurried to}} explain. [...] "We {{can put the}} end of the hook through the bottom from the outside, and fasten it on the inside with a nut. After it's done its work, why, {{all we have to do}} is to go down into the hold, unscrew the nut, and out drops the hook. Then drive a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> into the hole, and the Mary Rebecca will be all right again." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} that a heavy <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> {{had been driven}} into the ridge-pole just above Jim Cardegee's head. Jacob Kent, working softly, ran a piece of half-inch manila over it, bringing both ends to the ground. One end he tied about his waist, {{and in the other}} he rove a running noose. Then he cocked his shotgun and laid it within reach, by the side of numerous moose-hide thongs. By an effort of will he bore the sight of the scar, slipped the noose over the sleeper's head, and drew it taut by throwing back on his weight, at the same time seizing the gun and bringing it to bear.|$|E
5000|$|The jangada is {{typically}} made using 6 wooden logs rafted together in parallel: {{two in the}} center (called [...] "meios", or central ones), 2 more {{on either side of}} those (called [...] "mimburas", a Tupi word), and 2 on the outside, called [...] "bordos". The 4 most central logs ("meios" [...] and [...] "mimburas") are united using hard <b>wooden</b> <b>pegs,</b> made of stronger wood than the logs. The [...] "bordos" [...] are then bound to the [...] "mimburas" [...] using more <b>wooden</b> <b>pegs,</b> so they can be more elevated.|$|R

60|$|The {{white man}} who had helped to carry the chest was now kneeling, busied at some work, though what it was Tom at first could not see. He was whittling {{the point of a}} stick into a long <b>wooden</b> <b>peg,</b> and when, by-and-by, he had {{finished}} what he was about, he arose and stepped to where he who seemed to be the captain had stuck his cane upright into the ground as though to mark some particular spot. He drew the cane out of the sand, thrusting the stick down in its stead. Then he drove the long peg down with a wooden mallet which the negro handed to him. The sharp rapping of the mallet upon the top of the peg sounded loud in the perfect stillness, and Tom lay watching and wondering what it all meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is the perplexing sort of {{day that}} no one knows whether to call it fine or wet; but Ellen decided on going, as they were to dance in the hall if it rained. I'm sure her {{kindness}} is great, for she takes infinite trouble to make Janet producible! Poor Janet, you know dressing her is like hanging clothes on a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg,</b> and a peg that won't stand still, and has curious theories of the beautiful, carried out in a still more curious way. So when, in terror of our aunt, the whole female household have done their best to turn out Miss Janet respectable, between this house and Kencroft, she contrives to give herself some twitch, or else is seized with an idea of the picturesque, which sets every one wondering that I let her go about such a figure. Then Ellen and Jessie put a tie here, and a pin there, and reduce the chaotic mass to order." ...|$|E

60|$|At last, having {{apparently}} rested themselves, the conference, if conference it was, {{came to an}} end, and Levi led the way, {{the other}} following, to the dead pine tree. Here he stopped and began searching, as though for some mark; then, having found that which he looked for, he drew a tapeline and a large brass pocket compass from his pocket. He gave {{one end of the}} tape line to his companion, holding the other with his thumb pressed upon a particular part of the tree. Taking his bearings by the compass, he gave now and then some orders to the other, who moved a little to the left or the right as he bade. At last he gave a word of command, and, thereupon, his companion drew a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> from his pocket and thrust it into the sand. From this peg as a base they again measured, taking bearings by the compass, and again drove a peg. For a third time they repeated their measurements and then, at last, seemed to have reached the point which they aimed for.|$|E
60|$|People {{who have}} never gone to sea {{for the first time}} as sailors, can not imagine how puzzling and {{confounding}} it is. It must be like going into a barbarous country, where they speak a strange dialect, arid dress in strange clothes, and live in strange houses. For sailors have their own names, even for things that are familiar ashore; and if you call a thing by its shore name, you are laughed at for an ignoramus and a landlubber. This first day I speak of, the mate having ordered me to draw some water, I asked him where I was to get the pail; when I thought I had committed some dreadful crime; for he flew into a great passion, and said they never had any pails at sea, and then I learned that they were always called buckets. And once I was talking about sticking a little <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> into a bucket to stop a leak, when he flew out again, and said there were no pegs at sea, only plugs. And just so it was with every thing else.|$|E
60|$|Softly {{drawing the}} <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> {{that served as}} a bolt, Gabriel entered with that {{noiselessness}} and caution that were habitual to him. Lighting a candle by the embers of a dying fire, he carefully looked around him. The cabin was divided into two compartments by the aid of a canvas stretched between the walls, with a flap for the doorway. On a pine table lay several garments apparently belonging to a girl of seven or eight--a frock grievously rent and torn, a frayed petticoat of white flannel already patched with material taken from a red shirt, and a pair of stockings so excessively and sincerely darned, as to have lost nearly all of their original fabric in repeated bits of relief that covered almost the entire structure. Gabriel looked at these articles ruefully, and, slowly picking them up, examined each with the greatest gravity and concern. Then he took off his coat and boots, and having in this way settled himself into an easy dishabille, he took a box from the shelf, and proceeded to lay out thread and needles, when he was interrupted by a child's voice from behind the canvas screen.|$|E
50|$|These {{types of}} houses {{house was built}} to {{intentionally}} sway during earthquakes, thus allowing the buildings to withstand the earthquakes.

60|$|The horn {{in which}} western hunters carry their powder is usually {{that of an}} ox. It is closed up at the large end {{with a piece of}} hard wood fitted tightly into it, and the small end is closed with a <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> or stopper. It is, therefore, {{completely}} water-tight, and may be for hours immersed without the powder getting wet unless the stopper should chance to be knocked out. Dick found, to his great satisfaction, that the stopper was fast, and the powder perfectly dry. Moreover, he had by good fortune filled it full two days before from the package that contained the general stock of ammunition, so that there were only two or three charges out of it. His percussion caps, however, were completely destroyed, and even though they had not been, it would have mattered little, for he did not possess more than half a dozen. But this was not so great a misfortune as at first it might seem, for he had the spare flint locks and the little screw-driver necessary for fixing and unfixing them stowed away in his shot pouch.|$|E

The sharp rapping of the mallet upon the top of the peg sounded loud in the perfect stillness, and Tom lay watching and wondering what it all meant. The man, with quick-repeated blows, drove the peg farther and farther down into the sand until it showed only two or three inches above the surface. As he finished his work there was another faint flash of light, and by and by another smothered rumble of thunder, and Tom, as he looked out toward the westward, saw the silver rim of the round and sharply outlined thundercloud rising slowly up into the sky and pushing the other and broken drifting clouds before it.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were two}} reasons why Peggy {{could not go}} to live with [...] "Mahs' Junius and Miss Rob" [...] in New York. In the first place, this couple had no {{intention}} of setting up an establishment in that city; and secondly, Peggy, as Roberta well knew, was not adapted by nature to be her maid, or the maid of any one else. Peggy's true vocation in life was to throw her far-away gaze into futurity, and, as far as in her lay, to adapt present circumstances to what she supposed was going to happen. It would have delighted her soul if she could have been the adept in conjuring, which she firmly believed the Widow Keswick to be; but, as she possessed no such gift, she made up the deficiency, as well as she could, by mixing up her mind, her soul, and her desires, into a sort of witch's hodge-podge, which she thrust as a spell into the affairs of other people. Twice had the devices of this stupid-looking <b>wooden</b> <b>peg</b> of a negro girl stopped Lawrence Croft in the path he was following in his pursuit of Roberta March. If Lawrence had known, at the time, what Peggy was doing, he would have considered her an unmitigated little demon; but afterward, if he could have known of it, he would have thought her a very unprepossessing and conscienceless guardian angel.|$|E
