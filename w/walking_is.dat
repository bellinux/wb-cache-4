5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. <b>Walking</b> <b>is</b> the most common gait, where some feet {{are on the ground}} at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E

40|$|As {{safety of}} testing {{was the highest}} {{priority}} for physical ability measurement in elderly people, their motor ability was evaluated by means of test performance of walking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to review existing research on walking tests assessing motor ability of elderly people. Motor ability exerted to perform <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> assumed to be divided into three domains of speed, coordination, and endurance. The maximum and normal speed <b>walking</b> tests <b>were</b> used to measure walking speed in elderly people. The principal determinant of <b>walking</b> speed <b>was</b> stride that was affected by strength of lower limbs. Hurdle walking and the 8 -figure <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> used to measure coordination including balance and agility required in walking. Distance walking for 6 and/or 12 min was used to measure walking endurance. The 6 min distance <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> the most useful test item to assess the aerobic fitness level of elderly people. The 10 m hurdle walking test and the 6 min distance <b>walking</b> test <b>were</b> selected in Japan Fitness Test for 65 - 79 years of age...|$|R

5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; <b>walking</b> <b>is</b> by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} effect of the {{ordinary}} and the brisk walking for 60 minutes intermitted by each 10 minutes on blood pressure and Accelerated Plethysmography (APG), eight young and nine middle aged persons served as the subjects. Results are summarized as the follows. 1) Walking velocity during the ordinary and the brisk <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> 83. 1 m/min and 122. 1 m/min in the young and 83. 3 m/min and 118. 2 m/min in the middled aged persons respectively. There was {{no significant differences between the}} ordinary and brisk walking velocity both the young and the midle aged persons. 2) Heart rate during the ordinary and the brisk <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> 88. 4 ± 3. 5 beats/min (17. 4 ± 1. 770 f HRmaxreserve), 93. 9 ± 49. 3 beats/min (28. 2 ± 4. 5527777723260 f HRmaxreserve) in the young and 126. 1 ± 5. 5 beats/min (45. 1 ± 3. 6626662615000 f HRmaxreserve), 132. 2 ± 4. 8 beats/min (61. 7 ± 5. 0026662621600 f HRmaxreserve) in the middle aged persons respectively. The brisk <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> significantly faster than the ordinary walking. 3) Systolic blood pressure during intermittent 60 minutes walking in the ordinary and the brisk <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> 109. 1 ± 1. 4 mmHg and 126. 3 ± 3. 3 mmHg in the young and 136. 3 ± 9. 4 mmHg and 153. 2 ± 7. 5 mmHg in the middle aged persons respectively. Systolic blood pressure in the brisk <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> significantly higher than the resting values in the both aged group. Diastolic blood pressure in the ordinary and the brisk <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> 54. 13. 1 mmHg and 56. 8 ±mmHg in the young and 77. 1 ± 4. 3 mmHg and 72. 4 ± 5. 7 mmHg in the middle aged persons respectively. Diastolic blood pressure In the brisk <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> significantly lower than the resting values in the middle aged persons. 4) Accelerated Plethysmography (APG) at 10, 20 and 25 minutes after the brisk <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> significantly higher than resting values in the middle aged persons. 5) From above the mentioned, it may be concluded that the 60 minutes brisk walking intermitted by each 10 minutes is beneficial to improve peripheral circulation and to decline diastolic blood pressure in the middle aged persons...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if gait speed or <b>walking</b> distance <b>is</b> a better predictor for community walking after stroke. Methods: Data from the FIT-Stroke trial {{were used in}} a cross-sectional design. Community <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> measured with a self-administered questionnaire. The 5 -m timed walk and the 6 -min walk {{were used to assess}} gait speed and walking distance. With bivariate regression analyses the association between gait speed or walking distance and community <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> tested and possible confounders were identified. Discriminative properties of gait speed and walking distance for community <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> investigated by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: 79 % of 241 patients were classified as community walkers. Standing balance, fear of falling and time poststroke were found to be significant confounders in the relationship between gait speed and community walking. No significant confounders were found for the association between walking distance and community <b>walking.</b> There <b>was</b> {{no significant difference between the}} area under the curve of the ROC curves of gait speed (0. 86), walking distance (0. 89) and gait speed adjusted for confounding (0. 89). Conclusion: Gait speed and <b>walking</b> distance <b>are</b> equally appropriate predictors for community walking after stroke, whereas the contribution of confounders is limited. © 2013 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information...|$|R

25|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>is</b> also {{considered}} to be a clear example of a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and/or relatively shorter distances. Non-motorised transport modes such as walking, but also cycling, small-wheeled transport (skates, skateboards, push scooters and hand carts) or wheelchair travel are often key elements of successfully encouraging clean urban transport. A large variety of case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate walking as a means of transportation in cities can be found at Eltis, Europe's portal for local transport.|$|E
25|$|Human <b>walking</b> <b>is</b> {{accomplished}} with a strategy called the double pendulum. During forward motion, the leg {{that leaves the}} ground swings forward from the hip. This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes {{the ground with the}} heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground. The process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force.|$|E

Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
25|$|Nest {{activity}} is episodic and occurs in bursts rather than continuous activity throughout the day. Polistes instabilis spends {{roughly half of}} the daylight hours inactive and immobile. Periods of inactivity are broken when individuals initiate actions such as arriving, leaving, walking, antennating, gaster wagging, or fanning. These actions cause other workers to also begin working. 80% of {{activity is}} initiated by arriving or walking. Arriving triggers activity because when wasps arrive to the nest they bring materials to transfer to other workers. <b>Walking</b> <b>is</b> a first step taken in assessing needs of the colony, which can then be communicated to others. Queens do not differ from other workers in the initiation of active periods.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, beach walking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking and hiking. Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term <b>walking</b> <b>is</b> used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.|$|E
40|$|Background: Increasing adults' {{physical}} activity through environmental initiatives that promote walking {{as a public}} health priority. To this end, evidence relevant to the urban planning and transport sectors is required. This review synthesized findings on destination and route attributes associated with utilitarian and recreational walking. Methods: A literature search was conducted in April 2011 using Web of Science, PubMed, Transport Research Information Services, GEOBASE, and SPORTDiscus. Environmental attributes were classified into the domains of utilitarian and recreational destinations (presence, proximity, quality) and route (sidewalks, connectivity, aesthetics, traffic, safety). Forty-six studies examining associations of these attributes with utilitarian and/or recreational <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> identified. Specific destination and route attributes associated with each type of <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> summarized. Results: Adults' utilitarian <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> consistently associated with presence and proximity of retail and service destinations (in 80 % of the studies reviewed). It was also associated with functional aspects of routes (sidewalks and street connectivity) in 50 % of studies. Recreational <b>walking</b> <b>was</b> associated with presence, proximity, and quality of recreational destinations (35 % of studies) and route aesthetic (35 % of studies). Both types of <b>walking</b> <b>were</b> found unrelated to route safety and traffic in most studies. Conclusions: There is consistent evidence that better access to relevant neighborhood destinations (e. g., local stores, services, transit stops) can be conducive to adults' utilitarian walking. Some evidence also suggests that availability of sidewalks and well-connected streets can facilitate utilitarian walking. To better inform initiatives to promote adults' walking in the planning and transport sectors, future studies need to examine how accessible such destinations should be, as well as the effect of the quality of recreational destinations...|$|R
