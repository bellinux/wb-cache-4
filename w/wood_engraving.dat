5|$|Stars is a <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> print {{created by}} the Dutch artist M. C. Escher in 1948, {{depicting}} two chameleons in a polyhedral cage floating through space.|$|E
5|$|Escher {{learned his}} <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> {{technique}} from Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita. He illustrated the octahedral compound of Stars in the beveled wire-frame style {{that had been}} used by Leonardo da Vinci in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book, De divina proportione.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Christian Wilhelm Busch (15 April 1832– 9 January 1908) was a German humorist, poet, {{illustrator}} and painter. He published comic illustrated cautionary {{tales from}} 1859, achieving his most notable {{works in the}} 1870s. Busch's illustrations used <b>wood</b> <b>engraving,</b> and later, zincography.|$|E

5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. <b>Wood</b> <b>engraving</b> allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E
5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} the pinnacle of his medium, now called <b>wood</b> <b>engraving.</b> This is due both to his skill and to the method, which unlike the wood cut technique of his predecessors, carves against the grain, in hard box wood, using fine tools normally favoured by metal engravers.|$|E
5|$|Publisher Kaspar Braun, who {{commissioned}} Busch's first illustrations, {{had established}} the first workshop in Germany to use <b>wood</b> <b>engraving.</b> This letterpress printing technique {{was developed by}} English graphic artist Thomas Bewick {{near the end of}} the 18th century and became the most widely used reproduction system for illustrations over the years. Busch insisted on first making the drawings, afterwards writing the verse. Surviving preparatory drawings show line notes, ideas, and movement and physiognomy studies.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} drawings {{were made}} directly {{on to the}} <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> blocks by leading artists Thomas Baines, Walter Hood Fitch, John Gerrard Keulemans, E. W. Robinson, Joseph Wolf, and T. W. Wood, according to the List of Illustrations. Wood also illustrated Darwin's The Descent of Man, while Robinson and Wolf both also provided illustrations for The Naturalist on the River Amazons (1863), written by Wallace's friend Henry Walter Bates.|$|E
5|$|Bewick's last <b>wood</b> <b>engraving,</b> Waiting for Death, was {{of an old}} bony workhorse, {{standing}} forlorn by a tree stump, {{which he}} had seen and sketched as an apprentice; the work echoes William Hogarth's last work, The Bathos, which shows the fallen artist by a broken column. He died after a few days' illness on 8 November 1828, at his home. He was buried in Ovingham churchyard, beside his wife Isabella, who had died two years earlier, and not far from his parents and his brother John.|$|E
5|$|Stars is a <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> print; that is, it was {{produced}} by carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, and pale pink.|$|E

5|$|The wordless novel genre had flourished {{primarily}} {{during the}} 1920s and 1930s, {{but by the}} 1940s even the most prolific practitioners had abandoned it. Hyde was familiar with some such works by Lynd Ward, Otto Nückel, and the form's pioneer Frans Masereel. The high-contrast artwork of Southern Cross features dynamic curving lines uncommon in <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> and combines abstract imagery with realistic detail. It has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to the Canadian graphic novel, though it had no direct influence.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

50|$|Stone was a self-taught <b>wood</b> <b>engraver,</b> {{which makes}} his {{achievements}} more remarkable.

Most of the commissions discussed above were wood engravings, as was most of his work.|$|R

5|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1847, Evans, then 21, refused {{an offer of}} employment from Landells, deciding instead to go into business for himself as a wood-engraver and colour printer. In 1848 Evans engraved a title-page illustration, among other commissions, for the Illustrated London News. However, the Illustrated London News stopped employing him {{on the basis that}} his <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> was too fine for newspaper work. His final print for the Illustrated London News showed the four seasons, and was illustrated by Foster. In fact Foster received his first commission from the publisher Ingram, Cook, and Company to reproduce the four scenes in oil. In 1851, Ingram chose Evans to engrave three prints for Ida Pfeiffer's Travels in the Holy Land. He used three blocks for the work: the key-block, outlining the illustration, was printed in a dark-brown hue; the other two were in a buff colour and a grayish-blue colour. For the same firm, Evans completed an order for a book-cover using bright reds and blues on white paper. That year he received the first commission to print a book, written by Fanny Fern and illustrated by Foster. Evans had enough business to apprentice his two younger brothers, Wilfred and Herbert, and to buy a hand-press. Soon he moved his premises to Racquet Court, and bought three more hand-presses.|$|E

25|$|Engraving is the {{practice}} of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called engravings. <b>Wood</b> <b>engraving</b> {{is a form of}} relief printing and is not covered in this article.|$|E

25|$|The {{head saw}} mill was closed in 1931, but the edger mill was kept and refined coarse-cut wood from other mills in the area. Viscose became {{gradually}} more important; it {{was responsible for}} 30 percent of production in 1930 and 57 percent in 1937. Newsprint production was cut out and the remaining production move to finer grades of paper. The company also established production facilities for <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> and pressure treating. The 1930s were generally good times for the company, with a steady increase in prices. Then the bottom fell out the market in 1938, resulting in NOK2 million in losses.|$|E
25|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} artistic technique in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe beechwood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of cherry wood was popular.|$|E
