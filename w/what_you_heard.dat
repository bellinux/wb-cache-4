2500|$|There {{are some}} {{instances}} in his playing {{that are very}} unusual and highly complex, but the groove is never sacrificed. Within all the romping and stomping in his music, there were complexities in it that, if one tried to emulate it, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> and what excited you on the surface was supported by some extreme technical acrobatics finger-wise that made his music extraordinary as far as I’m concerned. And most of all, it always felt wonderful ... He was an extraordinary musician, both soul wise and groove wise ... He was just an amazing musician.|$|E
2500|$|Having been {{introduced}} to Georgescu during {{the final stage of}} the critic's career, Manea retold one of his confessions from the time: [...] "I suppose <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> about me is that I am a Stalinist. I'm not a Stalinist, Mr. Norman, know that. I was with Leiba Trotsky." [...] Manea also wrote: [...] "What struck about [...] was the contradiction between the extraordinary mobility of spirit and the Affixed Idea. [...] How did he pacify his disappointments and regenerate his militantism after having seen with his eyes, and his mind, and his heart the nightmarish masquerade of the totalitarian state?" [...] He added: [...] "The socialist tension between the 'conserved' ideal and the putrid reality maintained in those who gave up neither contempt nor complicity a sort of narcissistic and megalomaniac blindness." ...|$|E

6000|$|Said Foxy: [...] "After a fine speech like <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>'eard</b> {{night before}} last, {{you ought to}} take 'old of your drill with re-newed activity. I don't {{see how you can}} avoid comin' out an' marchin' in the open now." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> about {{a battle}} at Monocacy to-day? We have {{nothing about it}} here except <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say.|$|R
60|$|CAESAR. <b>What!</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> that, did you? I {{was saying}} my prayers {{to the great}} Sphinx.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard,</b> and {{a mighty}} purty song it is too, and kinder clings to you. It's {{wonderful}} {{how these things}} gets in your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{more than}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> him say on New Year's day--that {{he would go}} {{as soon as the}} weather got warm enough, and it was {{considered}} safe." ...|$|E
60|$|Const. Mr Burr, I owe you {{not that}} satisfaction; <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> may {{interpret}} as you please.|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> me speak, sir; {{circumstances}} alter cases, {{and this}} case is altogether an exceptional one.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Vickers hesitated. [...] "Because {{it would}} be such a silly thing to do," [...] she said, at last. [...] "Now, tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> all over again—slow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{but tell}} me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard,</b> [...] Campesino Garcia!' 'Shouting from the mountain-side, Shouting until eventide; But it dwindled and it died [...] Ere milking time was over.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You will excuse me, Hester,” {{she said}} very quietly. “I think I would sooner walk home alone. I will not {{ask you to}} {{remember}} that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> concerns only Tony and me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should never}} have defended Georgina's {{marriage}} if I had known the whole; {{but the rest of}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> is slander.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Listen {{to me for}} one moment, gentlemen," [...] cried Ned Sinton. [...] "I think I can relieve your minds. <b>What</b> have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> or seen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were looking}} into the engine-room," [...] I said; [...] "and you asked me what I heard there. You promised to tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard,</b> {{as soon as we}} got on shore--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But tell Mrs. Haney I've {{gone up to}} the mine. You can say to {{her that}} Williams sent for me. You can tell her, but to no one else, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> Dan say. You understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl smiled coldly. [...] "I mean exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard,</b> and, {{if you do}} not {{enlighten}} them, {{the settlers}} would probably not object to you. Your farm will be taken over at what you gave for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{found myself}} wishing I had some rich friends. By-the-bye, {{how is your}} rich friend? <b>What</b> have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> lately of Mr. Mountjoy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is true that}} I {{pulled him}} out of the sea, aided and abetted by Bucephalus, but whether all that <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> of me is true I cannot tell, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard.</b> Who told <b>you</b> of it?" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "It's very simple. Don't {{think about}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> here. Just don't think about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think you've understood. And then that {{understanding}} {{will have a}} chance to flower. But the more <b>you</b> think about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have understood, the more it's wasted." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hath any deserving {{stranger}} {{arrived in}} town since last meeting, that <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> of?

6000|$|... "Scribe Ana, I {{ask your}} pardon if, being vexed and wearied, I {{said to you}} and of you to-day what I now wish I had left unsaid. I know well that you, being of the gentle blood of Egypt, will make no report of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> outside these walls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard,</b> father, but {{it seems}} to have been knocked down to me at £2,300.
