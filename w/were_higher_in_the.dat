5|$|In North America, a Canadian {{study of}} 27,749 {{children}} in Quebec showed that thiomersal {{was unrelated to}} the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). In fact, the study noted that rates of PDDs <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> birth cohorts with no thiomersal when compared to those with medium or high levels of exposure. A study performed in the US which analyzed data from 78,829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes, noting different results from data in different HMOs. A study performed in California found that removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not decrease the rates of autism, suggesting that thiomersal could not be {{the primary cause of}} autism. A study on children from Denmark, Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with autism.|$|E
25|$|An {{assessment}} by Health Canada {{found that}} cancer mortality rates are almost identical {{in the two}} countries. Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S. In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries. Their analysis indicates that Canada has greater survival rates for both colorectal cancer and childhood leukemia, while the United States has greater survival rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as breast and cervical cancer.|$|E

500|$|Data {{accumulated}} from Council {{reports in}} New South Wales from April to June 2013, showed that dogs identified as Australian Cattle Dogs {{were involved in}} 66 attacks, where an attack is defined as any incident where a dog rushes at, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal. Staffordshire Bull Terrier (155 attacks), German Shepherd (89) and American Staffordshire Terrier (88) were reported {{to be involved in}} more incidents. Expressed as a percentage of registered dogs, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in attacks. [...] The data gathered in 2011–2012 listed the ACD twenty-seventh in involvement in incidents ranked by percentage of dogs registered. [...] A review of incidents in Melbourne where a dog bit, rushed at or chased a person or animal in a public space, found that there were sixty breeds involved and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses accounted for 9% of incidents. [...] Surveys of U.S. breed club members showed that both dog-directed aggression and stranger-directed aggression <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ACD than the average of breeds studied, with dog-directed aggression being the more prevalent of the two aggression types. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs. The average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4%.|$|E
60|$|I began these {{descriptions}} {{by saying}} that Oxney Colne would, of all places, be the best spot from which a tourist could visit those parts of Devonshire, but {{for the fact that}} he could obtain there none of the accommodation which tourists require. A brother antiquarian might, perhaps, in those days have done so, seeing that there was, as I have said, a spare bedroom at the parsonage. Any intimate friend of Miss Le Smyrger's might be as fortunate, for she was equally well provided at Oxney Combe, by which name her house was known. But Miss Le Smyrger was not given to extensive hospitality, and it was only to those who were bound to her, either by ties of blood or of very old friendship, that she delighted to open her doors. As her old friends were very few in number, as those few lived at a distance, and as her nearest relations <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world than she was, and were said by herself to look down upon her, the visits made to Oxney Combe were few and far between.|$|E
