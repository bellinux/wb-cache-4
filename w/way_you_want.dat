McIlarth notes that [...] "Torches" [...] {{is a very}} different when compared to most of the band's material, due to its heavy metal intro and breakdown. The penultimate track, [...] "Amber Changing", is more muted in its sound, and has McIlrath sing about not wanting a great moment in a relationship to end. The album ends with a hidden track, a cover of [...] "Any <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> It" [...] by Journey.

But the way our season is going, I'll be taking {{anything}} at the moment." [...] Second-place finisher Power said {{it was still a}} good finish for him in terms of scoring points. Tony Cotman, the circuit's design consultant, announced in February 2011 that the track would be improved and lengthened for that year. He stated that the layout of the track be moved to.the Eastern runway of the City Centre Airport in an attempt to create more excitement.

On May 3, 2007, she appeared as a guest on the WNYC radio series, The Tristan Mysteries, to discuss Richard Wagner's opera [...] "Tristan und Isolde". A long-time Wagner fan, Samson stated [...] "I think I'm {{in a unique position}} to discuss the sensual aspects of the 'Tristan and Isolde' characters and of opera in general". In June 2007, Savanna Samson Productions released its first title, Any <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> Me, an interactive movie directed by and starring Samson. She also appeared in the 2007 film Debbie Does Dallas ... Again, a sequel to the 1978 classic Debbie Does Dallas, as well as its [...] "making of" [...] series that was broadcast weekly on Showtime.

500|$|Perry {{described}} [...] "Love Me" [...] as a song [...] "about loving {{yourself the}} <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be loved". Gundersen called it [...] "irresistibly catchy and energetic". The song {{was produced by}} Bloodshy. Sarkesian called it [...] "an interesting mix – the lyrics are dark, but the music is very dance-centric. At the very least, it'll do well in clubs". Montgomery stated that [...] "Love Me" [...] and [...] "International Smile" [...] both [...] "seem destined for the dance floors". The latter was inspired by Perry's friend Mia Moretti, and was compared to the songs on Perry's previous album. Lipshutz called it a [...] "straightforward pop-rock offering" [...] and described its guitar hook as [...] "kicky", adding that the song also includes a [...] "Melting Daft Punk-esque vocoder breakdown". Halperin stated that in the song, Perry sings the [...] "hooky" [...] line: [...] "Please fasten your seat belts and make sure your champagne glasses are empty".|$|E
500|$|After {{discovering}} that Larry Burns {{is also working}} in Sector 7G, Homer frantically cleans up and puts away an almost entirely assembled jigsaw puzzle which has an image of Snoopy the dog lying on his doghouse. The puzzle is missing several pieces over where Snoopy's nose should be, which was intentionally drawn that way to avoid copyright laws. The character from Yale that Mr. Burns briefly talks to {{is based on the}} fictional character Dink Stover from the book Dink Stover at Yale by Owen Johnson. The episode contains several references to the film Caddyshack, such as the scene where Larry tries to fit in with Mr. Burns' associates and the ending street party which also parodies the way that several films, including Caddyshack, end with a party and feature the song [...] "Any <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> It" [...] by Journey.

500|$|The next day, Presley {{recorded}} [...] "Hound Dog", {{along with}} [...] "Any <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> Me" [...] and [...] "Don't Be Cruel". The Jordanaires sang harmony, {{as they had}} on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced, [...] "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight." [...] In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. The single pairing [...] "Don't Be Cruel" [...] with [...] "Hound Dog" [...] ruled {{the top of the}} charts for 11 weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.

500|$|Most {{or all of}} {{the episode}} was shot from September 11 to 23, 2007 and filming {{overlapped}} with the following episode. [...] The Tunisian desert scene was filmed on location in Oahu, Hawaii, {{like the rest of the}} episode, at a stone quarry with industrial fans blowing fake sand. [...] A typical Lost episode contains fifty visual effects shots. [...] Among scenes created entirely or partially with effects are the opening scene of [...] "Confirmed Dead", which shows what appears to be the wreckage of 815 underwater and the scene from Daniel's perspective as he parachutes from the helicopter to the ground. [...] In Frank's flashback, he drops a toy plane, which spirals into a small aquarium. [...] This shot was not intended to use effects; however, [...] "it's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it to", according to supervisor Mitch Suskin. [...] A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing. [...] Suskin said that creating effects for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was slightly too leisurely" [...] because the episode aired over four months after post-production began.|$|E

500|$|The season one {{finale of}} Glee first aired on Fox on June 8, 2010 in the US. The episode sees the fictional William McKinley High School glee club New Directions {{compete at the}} 2010 Midwest Regional Show Choir Championships. Director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) decides to have New Directions pay tribute to American rock band Journey. This was not only as homage to the cast's cover of [...] "Don't Stop Believin' in the season one premiere {{that led to his}} {{decision}} to remain at the school, but as a representation of the path undertaken to arrive at the Regionals level of competition. They perform a medley of Journey songs: the love ballad [...] "Faithfully", with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith on lead vocals as Rachel Berry and Finn Hudson, respectively, transitions into a mashup of [...] "Any <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> It" [...] and [...] "Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin".

500|$|In {{the popular}} {{music of the}} early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and {{engineers}} to freely experiment with musical form, arrangements, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some {{of the best known}} examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production formula and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronics for acts like the Tornados. XTC's Andy Partridge interprets the music of psychedelic groups as a [...] "grown-up" [...] version of children's novelty records, believing that many acts were trying to emulate those records that they grew up with; [...] "They use exactly the same techniques—sped-up bits, slowed-down bits, too much echo, too much reverb, that bit goes backwards. ... There was no transition to be made. You go from things like 'Flying Purple People Eater' to 'I Am the Walrus'. They go hand-in-hand." [...] Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to [...] "pin down" [...] the first psychedelic record are therefore [...] "nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record". Some of the [...] "far-fetched claims" [...] include the instrumental [...] "Telstar" [...] (produced by Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five's [...] "massively reverb-laden" [...] "Any <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> It" [...] (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers' 1960 surf instrumental [...] "LSD 25". A 1962 single by The Ventures, [...] "The 2000 Pound Bee", issued forth the buzz of a distorted, [...] "fuzztone" [...] guitar, and the quest into [...] "the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion" [...] and other effects, like improved reverb and echo began in earnest on London's fertile rock 'n' roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in [...] "I Feel Fine", their 6th consecutive No. 1 hit in the UK.|$|E
