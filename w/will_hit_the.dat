Sasha is killed when the plane crashes, {{and the others are}} spotted by Chinese Air Force helicopters. Yuri and his sons, {{possessing}} tickets, are brought to the arks and the Curtis family, Tamara and Gordon are left behind. On Ark 4, the American ark, Adrian is contacted by Satnam, who tells that he is stuck on the Nampan Plateau with his entire family as the airlift meant for them never came, with a massive tsunami coming from the east, killing Satnam himself, his entire family and all the evacuees around them. Enraged, Adrian estimates that the wave <b>will</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> arks in 28 minutes. The remaining group consisting of Jackson, Tamara, Noah, Lilly, Gordon and Kate, gets picked up by Nima and brought to the arks with his grandparents. With Tenzin's help they stow away on Ark 4. Due to the lack of time, Carl wants to leave immediately, but Adrian manages to use Satnam's death to convince the world leaders to let the people outside in.|$|E
25|$|Assuming the {{standardized}} value for g and ignoring air resistance, {{this means that}} an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity by 9.80665m/s (32.1740ft/s or 22mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665m/s (32.1740ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62m/s (64.4ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665m/s (32.1740ft/s) to each resulting velocity. Also, again ignoring air resistance, any and all objects, when dropped from the same height, <b>will</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground at the same time.|$|E

25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that <b>will</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) radio blackout. During this time {{very low frequency}} (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E
25|$|If, {{after the}} leader had {{selected}} its equilibrium quantity, the follower deviated from the equilibrium and chose some non-optimal quantity {{it would not}} only hurt itself, {{but it could also}} hurt the leader. If the follower chose a much larger quantity than its best response, the market price would lower and the leader's profits would be stung, perhaps below Cournot level profits. In this case, the follower could announce to the leader before the game starts that unless the leader chooses a Cournot equilibrium quantity, the follower will choose a deviant quantity that <b>will</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> leader's profits. After all, the quantity chosen by the leader in equilibrium is only optimal if the follower also plays in equilibrium. The leader is, however, in no danger. Once the leader has chosen its equilibrium quantity, it would be irrational for the follower to deviate because it too would be hurt. Once the leader has chosen, the follower is better off by playing on the equilibrium path. Hence, such a threat by the follower would not be credible.|$|E

500|$|After {{departing from}} the station, which resembles an {{airplane}} hangar, the train immediately begins {{to climb the}} steep [...] chain lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift hill, the train enters the first element of the roller coaster, a Dive Drop. This element is similar to the Dive Drop's found on The Swarm at Thorpe Park and GateKeeper at Cedar Point and consists of the train rotating 180 degrees into an upside down position before descending back to the ground. During this drop, the train reaches its top speed of [...] At the bottom of the first drop, riders get their picture taken. After the train exits the first drop, the train then enters a zero-g-roll before going through a cloud of fog. The train then makes a slight left turn before entering an Immelmann loop followed by a right turn over a pond. The train then leads into the second zero-g-roll over the main entrance of the ride. Following the roll, the train makes a left turn before going through an Inline twist. During this element, which is known as a keyhole, riders go through an actual airplane control tower (which was retrieved from O'Hare International Airport), giving the illusion the train <b>will</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> tower. After going through the tower, the train goes through another near miss keyhole surrounded by a cloud of fog, before exiting the twist and making a tight right turn, passing by Demon's corkscrews and last turn, before making a slight left upward turn leading into the brake run. The train then makes a 180-degree left turn into another set of brakes before entering the station. One cycle lasts about 1 minute and 15 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{objective}} in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than [...] "carry" [...] (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes {{the right side}} of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as [...] "riding the rail" [...] among spinners. A properly thrown spinner <b>will</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball moves down the row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as [...] "mixing"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.|$|E
