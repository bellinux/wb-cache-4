The work, consisting of photographs of the thousands of people who touched Sakıp Sabancı in some way throughout his life, reflects the businessman’s thoughts on human beings, life and art as well as his energy. Then again the work multiplies, underlining and giving meaning to human existence which will continue virtually forever. Kutluğ Ataman created this work which constitutes a moment of silence in honour of Sakıp Sabancı and emphasizes his contribution to the development of technology in Turkey. Ataman used state-of-the-art technology in creating this work where the [...] "raw material is, as a whole, human."

2500|$|Asha is an {{excellent}} cook and cooking is her favorite hobby. She often gets flooded with requests by Bollywood celebrities for kadai ghosht and biryani dishes and has rarely turned down a request. In fact, her paya curry, Goan fish curry and dal are very popular with the Kapoor family of Bollywood. Once, when asked in a Times of India interview, what if her singing career had not taken off, she said [...] "I would have become a cook. I'd have cooked in four houses and made money." [...] The love of cooking got Asha into a successful restaurant business. She runs restaurants in Dubai and Kuwait called Asha's. Asha's offers traditional north-western Indian cuisine. It has {{a presence in the}} Wafi City development in Dubai, as well as three restaurants in Kuwait, at The Avenues Mall, the Marina Mall and a brand new third outlet at the Spoons Complex. Other restaurants can be found in Abu Dhabi's Khaldiya Mall, Doha's Villagio and Bahrain's City Center Mall, with future outposts planned for Dubai's Mall of the Emirates and Cairo, Egypt. Asha Bhosle has a 20% stake in the business. Asha is not involved in the day-to-day running of the restaurant which is looked after by the Wafi Group. She takes care of the kitchen and the décor. She personally trained the chefs for almost six months. According to a December 2004 report in Menu Magazine, Russell Scott, a former head of Harry Ramsden's (the fish and chips chain), secured the UK rights to the Asha's brand and planned to open up to 40 restaurants over the next five years. As part of her chain of restaurants, Asha has recently opened a new restaurant in Birmingham, UK.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} cinematic {{depictions of the}} Irish between 1910 and 1930. American cinema during these years, like those that preceded them, contained a range of stereotypical Irish characters. However, as cinema began {{to move away from}} short sketches and produce longer films, more complex plots and refined Irish characters began to appear. The onscreen Irish became vehicles for recurring themes, the majority of which had uplifting narratives. This paper will discuss common character types, such as the Irish cop and domestic servant, and subjects such as the migration narrative, the social reform narrative and the inter-ethnic comedy. It will also briefly consider how Irish depictions in the 1910 s and 1920 s compared to earlier representations. While the emphasis <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> films <b>viewed</b> at archives, including the University of California, Los Angeles Film and Television Archive, or acquired through private and commercial sellers, the paper will also reflect on some films that are currently considered lost...|$|R
