40|$|Abstract：Surface <b>wave</b> {{dispersion}} <b>imaging</b> {{approach is}} crucial for multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW). Because the resolution of inversed S-wave velocity and thickness of a layer are directly subjected to the resolution of imaged dispersion curve. The τ-p transform approach is an efficient and commonly used approach for Rayleigh <b>wave</b> dispersion curve <b>imaging.</b> However, the conventional τ-p transform approach was severely affected by wave’s amplitude. So, the energy peaks of f-v spectrum were mainly gathered in a narrow frequency range. In order to remedy this shortage, an improved τ-p transform approach was proposed by this paper. Comparison has been made between phase-shift and improved τ-p transform approaches using both synthetic and in situ tested data. Result shows that the dispersion image transformed from proposed approach is superior to that either from conventionally τ-p transform or from phase-shift approaches. Preface Multi-channel analysis of surface wave(MASW) is robust in obtaining shear wave velocity of shallow site because of its efficiency and low cost(Xia et al., 1999; Park et al, 1999; Calderon-Macias and Luke, 2007). Using the dispersive property of Rayleigh wave, dispersion curve can be imaged from in situ tested data. Surface <b>wave</b> dispersion <b>imaging</b> is crucial i...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{emission}} {{strategy in the}} context of plane <b>wave</b> <b>imaging.</b> Plane <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> indeed implies compounding in order to preserve a good image quality. Such compounding is usually obtained using multiple, successive emissions, which in turn yields a decrease of the frame rate. As opposed to this approach, our method is based on the simultaneous emission of several coded plane waves. This allows the reconstruction of all the images corresponding to the different plane waves, by using an inverse problem approach. The proposed method is closely related to channel estimation in telecommunications, and coded excitation in synthetic aperture ultrasound imaging. In this paper, we thus extend these lines of work to the case of ultrasound plane <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> and evaluate the obtained performance from various numerical simulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Guided <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> {{techniques}} {{employed for}} structural health monitoring (SHM) can be computationally demanding, especially for adaptive {{techniques such as}} minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) imaging, which requires a matrix inversion for each pixel calculation. Instantaneous windowing {{has been shown in}} previous work to improve guided <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> performance. The use of instantaneous windowing has the additional benefit of significantly reducing the compu-tational requirements of image generation. This paper derives a formula-tion for MVDR imaging using instantaneous windowing and shows that the matrix inversion associated with MVDR imaging can be optimized, reducing the computational complexity to that of conventional delay-and-sum imaging algorithms. Additionally, a vectorized approach is presented for implementing guided <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> algorithms, including delay-and-sum imaging, in matrix-based software packages. The improvements in computational efficiency are quantified by measuring computation time for different array sizes, windowing assumptions, and imaging methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The use of {{numerical}} and {{phased array}} techniques to focus guided waves and perform inspection of plates and pipes {{has not been}} widely used; it represents an interesting solution for defect detection and localization. In addition, imaging of ultrasonic guided wave results using color coded B-Scans is also considered a highly valuable tool for data interpretation. While commercial ultrasonic phased array systems have both the ability to perform focusing and present data in B or S-Scan formats, they are not designed to perform guided wave focusing. The present paper presents an experimental study {{for the implementation of}} ultrasonic guided wave focal law algorithms into phased array systems. Focal laws are calculated for the inspection of plate structures using ultrasonic Lamb waves generated by the angle beam wedge method.

Q-switched laser beams were scanned to generate ultrasonic waves around the weld bead. The localization and sizing of the crack were possible by ultrasonic <b>wave</b> propagation <b>imaging.</b> Furthermore, ultrasonic spectral imaging unveiled frequency components of damage-induced waves, while wavelet-transformed ultrasonic propagation imaging enhanced damage visibility by generating a wave propagation video focused on the frequency component of the damage-induced waves. Dual-directional anomalous <b>wave</b> propagation <b>imaging</b> with adjacent <b>wave</b> subtraction was also developed to enhance the crack visibility regardless of crack orientation and wave propagation direction. In conclusion, the full-scale specimen test demonstrated that the multiple damage visualization tools are very effective in the visualization of J-groove dissimilar weld cracks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Millimeter waves {{can be used}} {{to detect}} {{concealed}} objects because they can penetrate clothing. Therefore, millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> draws increasing attention in security applications for the detection of objects under clothing. In such applications, it is critical to estimate the distances from objects concealed in open spaces. In this paper, we develop a segmentation-based stereo-matching method based on passive millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> to estimate the longitudinal distance from a concealed object. In this method, the concealed object area is segmented and extracted by a k-means algorithm with splitting initialization, which provides an iterative solution for unsupervised learning. The distance from a concealed object is estimated on the basis of discrepancy between corresponding centers of the segmented objects in the image pair. The conventional stereo-matching equation is modified according to the scanning properties of the passive millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> system. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate distances from concealed objects. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{simulate}} imaging systems, Fourier optics {{has been}} applied very successfully to optics for decades. However, when simply moving to indoor millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> systems, some assumptions underlying the Fourier optics may break down, which contribute to the errors by applying Fourier optics. During the review of mathematical derivation of the Fourier optics, we point out how the errors are introduced by making the Fresnel approximation and omitting the phase factors. To distinguish from much literature, we discuss the accuracy of Fresnel approximation rather than plane wave. Moreover, we check the simulation results for millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> systems working in both pixel scanning mode and focal plane array mode and compare them to the results predicted by Fourier optics. It is shown that the difference can be 28 % for the speckle contrast when the object is with certain roughness. The optical routine {{is that when the}} lens is four times ’ larger than the object, the imaging system can be considered as isoplanatic, thus Fourier optics can hold. Our simulation results imply that it may not be valid in indoor millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> systems. The goal {{of this paper is to}} draw some attention to the possibly large errors when modeling or designing the indoor millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>imaging</b> systems by Fourier optics directly.
