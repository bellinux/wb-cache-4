5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down.

Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse.

The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke.

It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E
