5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E

25|$|When the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League {{was unable}} to {{continue}} in 1955, its history and its significance were soon forgotten. Many people in the 1950s thought that women <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> play baseball, so most female athletes competed on other fields of endeavor. Finally, in 1980, former pitcher June Peppas launched a newsletter project {{to get in touch}} with friends, teammates and opponents, that resulted in the league’s first-ever reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed five years later and many former players of the defunct league continued to enjoy reunions.|$|E

The number of combat advisers in Vietnam when Kennedy died varies depending upon source.

In 1958 {{he was part of}} a Parliamentary delegation to the United States.

25|$|The SM-sarja {{was also}} {{outdated}} on its own, {{as it was}} run according to amateur principles. Clubs <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> pay their players beyond compensation for lost wages. However, by the 1970s many clubs were already run like businesses and recruited players through a contract of employment, paying their wages secretly and often evading taxes. However, in 1974, accounting reform in Finland extended book-keeping standards to cover sports clubs, and shortfalls were exposed in audit raids. The SM-liiga was to allow wages for players, and clubs were also put under a tighter supervision. They were to establish their own association for SM-liiga ice hockey only, separating their commitments from junior activities and other sports. Copies of all player contracts were {{to be sent to}} the SM-liiga to provide players with adequate security, such as insurance and pensions.|$|E

25|$|Medieval Dublin was {{a tightly}} knit place of around 5,000 to 10,000 people, {{intimate}} enough for every newly married citizen to be escorted {{by the mayor}} to the city bullring to kiss the enclosure for good luck. It was also very small in area, an enclave hugging {{the south side of}} the Liffey of no more than three square kilometres. Outside the city walls were suburbs such as the Liberties, on the lands of the Archbishop of Dublin, and Irishtown, where Gaelic Irish were supposed to live, having been expelled from the city proper by a 15th-century law. Although the native Irish <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> live in the city and its environs, many did so and by the 16th century, English accounts complain that Irish Gaelic was starting to rival English as the everyday language of the Pale.|$|E
25|$|The Rome branch {{was always}} busy. The Papal court was {{attended}} by hundreds of minor officials, both ecclesiastical and secular, along with their attendants. The needs of the Papal court were such {{that there was a}} measurable rise in the frequency of money shortages wherever the court went. This led to a need for banking services that the Medici could provide. The various bishops, cardinals, and prelates often held Church or private estates in far-flung states in and beyond Italy. The revenues from these estates needed to be transferred to wherever the Court was residing. A more practical reason was that alternate investments generally took the form of real estate, and any cardinal or bishop who invested overly much in real estate (which they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to)</b> or relied on income from Church lands might see his investments confiscated under a new Pope who might not favor him so much or even turned over to a replacement. Accounts with the Medici were kept secret and generally free from prying, ecclesiastical eyes, {{especially in the case of}} discretionary deposits.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the old Romanian Orthodox cathedral in Sibiu {{had been}} {{demolished}} in 1902 {{and a new}} building begun. A competition for the painting opened in November 1903, with fifteen Romanian, German and Hungarian participants. A committee composed of George Demetrescu Mirea, Ion Mincu and Friedrich Miess narrowed the field down to three finalists. In April 1904, Smigelschi was selected to execute the interior painting. He was paid 32,000 crowns for the cupola, the pendentives and the iconostasis. At this time, he {{began to focus on}} traditional styles of painting, seeking {{to strike a balance between}} large-scale murals and the architectural surroundings which they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> overshadow. Accordingly, in 1904, he crossed into the Romanian Old Kingdom as well as the Duchy of Bukovina in order to study the churches and monasteries where the Romanians' spiritual heritage is expressed, familiarizing himself with the Byzantine style that came to complement his knowledge of Renaissance painting. Reportedly, his interest in Byzantine art had first manifested itself in Italy, when he sketched after the monuments of Ravenna.|$|E

25|$|Having {{achieved}} a breakthrough of the enemy's line, units comprising the Schwerpunkt <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> become decisively engaged with enemy front line units {{to the right}} and left of the breakthrough area. Units pouring through the hole were to drive upon set objectives behind the enemy front line. In World War II, German Panzer forces used motorised mobility, to paralyse the opponent's ability to react. Fast-moving mobile forces seized the initiative, exploited weaknesses and acted before opposing forces could respond. Central to this was the decision cycle (tempo). Decision-making required time to gather information, make a decision, give orders to subordinates to implement the decision. Through superior mobility and faster decision-making cycles, mobile forces could act quicker than the forces opposing them. Directive control was a fast and flexible method of command. Rather than receiving an explicit order, a commander would be told of his superior's intent and the role which his unit was to fill in this concept. The method of execution was then a matter for the discretion of the subordinate commander. Staff burden was reduced at the top and spread among tiers of command with knowledge about their situation. Delegation and the encouragement of initiative aided implementation, important decisions could be taken quickly and communicated verbally or with brief written orders. Germans soldiers also used Pervitin, a form of Amphetamine, which was given to drivers, to keep them awake.|$|E

It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was about to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.|$|E
