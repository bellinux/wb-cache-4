50|$|Flea beetles do {{not survive}} in the {{northern}} half of Illinois due to low winter temperatures. Those found in late spring or summer have migrated from the south. Snow or other winter cover apparently provides insufficient shelter to enhance survival of the overwintering flea beetles.

40|$|AbstractWireworms, the {{larval stage}} of click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae), are serious soil {{dwelling}} pests of small grains, corn, sugar beets, and potatoes. Limonius californicus and Hypnoidus bicolor are the predominant <b>wireworm</b> species infesting wheat in Montana, {{particularly in the}} ‘Golden Triangle’ area of north-central Montana. <b>Wireworm</b> populations in field crops are increasing, but currently available insecticides provide only partial control, and no alternative management tools exist. In our study, three entomopathogenic fungi were tested for their efficacy against wireworms in spring wheat at two field locations (Ledger and Conrad, Montana, USA) in 2013. The three fungi (Metarhizium brunneum F 52, Beauveria bassiana GHA, and Metarhizium robertsii DWR 346) were evaluated as seed-coat, in-furrow granular, and soil band-over-row drench applications in addition to imidacloprid (Gaucho® 600) seed treatment (as a chemical check), the approach currently being used by growers. <b>Wireworm</b> damage in these treatments was evaluated as standing plant counts, <b>wireworm</b> population surveys, and yield.

40|$|<b>Wireworms</b> are {{the soil}} {{dwelling}} larvae of click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae). Their importance as crop pests increases since the efficient chemical means {{to control them}} cannot be considered anymore. Therefore, many integrated pest management strategies have been investigated {{in the past few}} years. Most of them rely on the understanding of the ecology of the click beetles during their whole life cycle. We focus our work on the chemical ecology of <b>wireworms,</b> more precisely on the root-emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that might intervene in the food-searching process of the larvae by helping them to find a suitable host-plant or by acting as key factors in the belowground defence mechanism of the plant. Here, we present our first results of dual-choice orientation tests in olfactometric pipes. <b>Wireworms</b> (Agriotes sordidus Illiger) were submitted individually to a variety of olfactory baits ranging from entire barley roots (Hordeum vulgare L. var. Quench) to isolated VOCs identified as part of the emitting profile. The latter was described thanks to HS-SPME samplings and GC-MS analysis, for roots grown in the exact same conditions as for the olfactometric experimentations with entire roots. Most of the experimentations gave significant results. When confronted to volatiles emitted by entire roots, <b>wireworms</b> significantly orientated towards the bait (χ²-goodness-of-fit test, χ²= 8, P-value= 0. 005). This result allowed us to follow up with the same device and to progressively vary the nature of the baits. Our protocol should be used for other plant-wireworm species combinations.

However, it is largely unknown whether plant genotypes differ in their response to root herbivores, leading to variable defensive phenotypes. In this study, we investigated whether root-feeding insect larvae (Agriotes sp. larvae, <b>wireworms)</b> induce different responses in Plantago lanceolata plants from lines selected for low {{and high levels of}} iridoid glycosides (IG). In the absence of <b>wireworms,</b> plants of the ¿high-IG line¿ contained approximately twofold higher levels of total IG and threefold higher levels of catalpol (one of the IG) in leaves than plants from the ¿low-IG line,¿ whereas both lines had similar levels of IG in roots. In response to <b>wireworms,</b> roots of plants from both lines showed increased concentrations of catalpol. Leaves of ¿low-IG line¿ plants increased catalpol concentrations in response to <b>wireworms,</b> whereas catalpol concentrations of leaves of ¿high-IG line¿ plants decreased. In contrast, glucose concentrations in roots of ¿low-IG¿ plants decreased, while they increased in ¿high-IG¿ plants after feeding by <b>wireworms.</b> The leaf volatile profile differed between the lines, but was not affected by root herbivores. In the field, leaf damage by herbivores was higher in wireworm-induced compared to noninduced ¿low-IG¿ plants and lower in wireworm-induced compared to noninduced ¿high-IG¿ plants, despite induction of catalpol in leaves of the ¿low-IG¿ plants and reduction in ¿high-IG¿ plants.
