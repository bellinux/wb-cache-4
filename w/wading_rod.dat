30|$|Water temperature, {{specific}} conductance, pH, {{dissolved oxygen}} (DO), and percent saturation of DO were measured using a YSI 556 multiprobe (YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA) {{at each of}} 5 sampling sites per stream during summer sampling periods. Continuous water temperature measurements were taken every 60 minutes from 28 April to 30 September, 2011, at each stream using HO-BO™ Pro V 2 dataloggers (Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, Massachusetts, USA), {{with the exception of}} Bonita Creek, where the datalogger was lost. Water depth and velocity were measured at each sampling location during summer sampling periods using a Rickly USGS top setting <b>wading</b> <b>rod</b> (Rickly Hydrological Co., Inc., Columbus, Ohio, USA) and a Marsh-McBirney pressure sensor (Marsh-Mc-Birney Inc., Frederick, Maryland, USA).|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is {{evaluating}} {{the use of}} hydroacoustic current meters for making discharge measurements in shallow rivers and streams. The USGS historically has made discharge measurements in shallow rivers using mechanical, impellor-type current meters attached to a <b>wading</b> <b>rod.</b> The evaluation project has focused on three categories of hydroacoustic meters: an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) called a Flowtracker 3, an acoustic Doppler velocity profiler (BoogieDopp), and bottom-tracking acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). The USGS role in this project includes providing USGS discharge-computation methods and algorithms to instrument manufacturers and evaluating instruments in the laboratory and field. An ADV (Flowtracker) designed for making discharge measurements in shallow rivers, has been tested in a USGS tow tank and was found to meet USGS calibration standards for mechanical, impellor-type current meters. The Flowtracker was field tested by USGS offices in five states; the tests were conducted by comparing discharge measurements made with the ADV to discharge measurements made with mechanical, impellor-type current meters. In general, the comparisons of Flowtracker performance to mechanical-meter results were favorable. An acoustic Doppler velocity profiler (BoogieDopp) is being evaluated for making discharge measurements in shallow rivers. The Boogiedopp will measure vertical velocity profiles at stationary positions across a channel, and the velocity profiles {{will be used to}} compute discharge. Discharge-computation software based on USGS methods and algorithms is under development for the acoustic Doppler velocity profiler. The USGS will evaluate bottom-tracking ADCPs from two manufacturers for making discharge measurements in shallow water. The bottom-tracking feature allows ADCPs to compute discharge from a moving platform as the platform moves across the channel...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Geology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Anthropogenic {{processes}} {{have altered}} the natural state of the Feather River creating unsuitable habitat for spawning salmonids. These processes have restricted the natural flow of the river resulting in an armored river bed. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify areas to reduce armoring and enhance salmonid spawning habitat. 	This study is sponsored by the California Department of Water Resources and will be conducted for a period of 4 years starting in the Fall of 2011. Three riffle complexes on the Feather River were studied to evaluate the condition of the salmonid spawning habitat prior to restoration. The sites were analyzed for grain size utilizing Wolman pebble counts and bulk samples. Piezometers were installed throughout each riffle complex to measure hyporheic conditions such as dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, and turbidity. Surface water depth, velocity, and direction of flow measurements were made using a Marsh/McBirney current meter affixed to a topset <b>wading</b> <b>rod.</b> Gravel permeability was tested using Barnard-McBain standpipe tests and upwelling was measured using a bubble manometer board and in-river baffle. 	The three restoration sites currently have poor salmonid spawning habitat. The gravels at the sites are too large for the salmonids to manipulate and low hydraulic conductivity was prevalent through the sites. Low dissolved oxygen was also present at the proposed restoration sites. The restoration sites lacked significant gravel bars or geomorphic structures. The sites need improvement with the installation of transverse bars, riffles, and the addition of smaller size grains. This will reduce armoring and increase hyporheic flow. Geolog...|$|E

50|$|The 1969 Wimbledon Championships was a {{combined}} men's and women's tennis tournament that was played on outdoor grass courts. It {{was the second}} edition of the event in the Open Era and the 83rd since its formation. It {{was held at the}} All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon, London from 23 June through 5 July 1969. Ann Haydon-Jones became the first British champion of the open era, the first victor since 1961; Britain would have to wait 8 years, until the 1977 tournament to see another British winner in the singles competition - Virginia <b>Wade.</b> <b>Rod</b> Laver won the men's singles title, his fourth Wimbledon crown after 1961, 1962 and 1968, and went on to win his second Grand Slam after 1962.|$|R
