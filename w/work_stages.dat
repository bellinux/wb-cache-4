50|$|Scrumban is a {{software}} production model based on Scrum and Kanban. Scrumban is especially suited for product maintenance with frequent and unexpected work items, such as production defects or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the <b>work</b> <b>stages</b> and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's workflow is directed {{in a way that}} allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, {{and on the other hand}} ensures each team member is constantly employed.|$|E
50|$|Not all of {{the portraits}} are {{exceptional}} artistically, although there are self-portraits by William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds and other British artists of note. Some, such as the group portrait {{of the participants in}} the Somerset House Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the anamorphic portrait of Edward VI by William Scrots, Patrick Branwell Brontë's painting of his sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne, or a sculpture of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969.

5000|$|John Daniel Wild {{wrote the}} {{following}} in 1959: [...] In classical thought, the world (kosmos) {{is viewed as}} a hierarchy of beings whose structure is already fixed apart from human choice. Man is fitted into this closed system and occupies an intermediate position in the hierarchy. He {{has nothing to do with}} determining the meaning of this world-unless he misunderstands it. His proper function is to let its real, cosmic meaning float into his empty mind from the outside, and then to adjust himself to it as it already is. The general pattern of the good life he is to pursue has been inscribed forever on his nature. His freedom has no effect on this end. It is restricted to a choice of means within his reach.In the New Testament, the term kosmos is employed in a very different way. Take, for instance, the saying in the Gospel of John: “He was in the world-and the world knew Him not” (John 1:10). Many other examples of this sort could be quoted from the Johannine literature and the Pauline Epistles. The term world in these passages does not refer to a fixed, objective cosmos, existing in complete independence of man. It refers rather to man and his world together, to man as existing in a certain condition in a world that is relative to him. In his early work Either/Or and his later <b>work</b> <b>Stages</b> on the Way of Life, Kierkegaard tried to work out this man-world conception, showing in a purely phenomenological manner, without any special appeal to faith, how, in fact the basic choice of a way of life effects not only the thought of the human individual, the way he understands himself, but his feelings, his action, the objects of his attention, and the whole structure of his world.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to measure and compare peak oxygen uptake and {{paddling}} efficiency in recreational and competitive junior male surfers. Eight male recreational surfers (mean age 18 years, s= 2; mass 66. 8 kg, s= 13. 0; height 1. 75 m, s= 0. 10) and eight male competitive surfers (mean age 18 years, s= 1; mass 68. 0 kg, s= 11. 7; height 1. 72 m, s= 0. 10) performed an incremental paddling test consisting of four 3 -min constant load <b>work</b> <b>stages</b> followed by a ramp increase in power output of 20 W 砳 0 s- 1 until exhaustion. The oxygen uptake-power output relationship of the four constant load <b>work</b> <b>stages</b> and peak values obtained during the incremental paddling test were used to calculate paddling efficiency. No differences (P> 0. 05) were observed between the recreational and competitive surfers for peak oxygen uptake (recreational: 2. 52 litres 砭in- 1, s= 0. 5; competitive: 2. 66 litres 砭in- 1, s= 0. 35) or efficiency (recreational: 24 %, s= 3; competitive: 21 %, s= 4). Blood lactate concentration was significantly greater in recreational (2. 4 mmol 砬- 1, s= 0. 9) than competitive surfers (1. 6 mmol 砬- 1, s= 0. 5) during submaximal paddling. There were no differences in peak oxygen uptake or paddling efficiency between recreational and competitive surfers suggesting that peak oxygen uptake and efficiency are not sensitive to differences in surfing ability. The increase in blood lactate concentration during submaximal paddling in recreational compared with competitive surfers suggests that other determinants of paddling endurance, such as blood lactate threshold, might be better at distinguishing surfers of differing ability.

40|$|When <b>work</b> <b>stages</b> {{are lacking}} {{standard}} operating procedures, the same tasks are done differently leaning {{heavily on the}} experience and the tacit knowledge of the operator. The research problem is that production targets are not always reached with given time and materials, because of the variation between different shifts in the quality and the production efficiencies. The {{aim of this study}} is to find the key <b>work</b> <b>stages</b> and the key talents that are effecting on the production stability and to plan a road map how the variation can be stabilized in long-term This thesis consists of the conceptual analysis of Lean Manufacturing theory and impact on work standardization, and theory of Knowledge Management, in scope of tacit knowledge and its transferring methods to explicit form. The second part is the empirical part, in which the information of the key challenges of hitting targets of the case company was gathered interviewing and studying historical data. The empirical data is in addition based on researcher´s own experience. Using the theoretical background, the suggestion was made for mapping the knowledge gaps in the case company and develop tools to transfer tacit knowledge to be shared as standard operation procedures within the production teams. The goal is to improve eventually production stability so that the targets can be achieved in every shift irrespective who is working on the shift. The purpose was to achieve a feasible road map for the process improvement. By creating the road map for standardizing the key tasks, production stability and output reliability can be achieved, which leads to more flexible production and better customer service in long-term. Production stability comes from producing planned products in the right quality, at the right time and in the right quantity. Standardized processes are also the key for continuous improvement; improvement process starts from the existing standards...|$|E
