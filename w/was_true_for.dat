5|$|Though the location, plan of attack, {{and timing}} were {{determined}} by Hitler, he blamed the defeat on his General Staff. Unlike Stalin, who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions, Hitler's interference in German military matters progressively increased while {{his attention to the}} political aspects of the war decreased. The opposite <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> Stalin; throughout the Kursk campaign, he trusted the judgment of his commanders, and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment. Stalin stepped back from operational planning, only rarely overruling military decisions, resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action {{during the course of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. The same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the training sequence, where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from visors and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing, Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E

Notably, it was Protagoras who coined the phrase, [...] "Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not." [...] The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponents, Plato and Socrates. In a well known paraphrased dialogue with Socrates, Protagoras said: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> you <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> you, and what <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> me <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R

It also resulted to the shutdown of some businesses, a decline in importation, a rising unemployment rate and an unstable financial sector.|$|E

This theme runs through Vitruvius’s ten books repeatedly – echoing an implicit prediction that his works and himself will also be unknown.

25|$|In {{the same}} treaty, the Seminoles {{were the first}} tribe {{relocated}} to the ceded Creek land.

Later, the Kickapoo were moved in and, lastly, the Iowa. The combined Cheyenne Arapaho tribe was given the western end of the Creek and Seminole land along with some land ceded from the other tribes.

Many who tasted the reintroduced formula were not convinced that the first batches really were the same formula that had supposedly been retired that spring. This <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> some regions because Coca-Cola Classic differed from the original formula in that all bottlers who hadn't already done so were using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar to sweeten the drink.|$|E

25|$|Through his {{research}} with the rats, he learned that forgetting was dependent {{on the amount of}} tissue removed and not where it was removed from.

But we know now that mass action <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> these rats, because learning to run a maze is known as complex learning and it requires multiple cortical areas, so cutting into individual parts alone will not erase the memory from the rats' brains, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time and so they can forget.|$|E
25|$|Artificial landscapes often mimicked sacred landscapes. Doorways of temples {{were seen}} as the cave entrances to mountains. Sometimes these doorways were witz monster mouths.

In the Yucatán many Late Postclassic temples had Spanish churches built {{on top of them}} after the conquest and so caves and cenotes can still be found near these places today.|$|E
25|$|The Oslo Metro was {{approved}} {{of by the}} city council in 1951. It would consist of a common, underground section in the city center and above-ground lines in the suburbs. It was soon evident {{that one of the}} suburban lines, the Lambertseter Line, would be completed in the order of magnitude of a decade before it could be hooked to the Common Tunnel. A similar situation <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the Østensjø Line, which had been completed as a tramway in 1923. Oslo Sporveier was therefore given the task of operating the lines as tramways until the metro could open. The company considered building additional MO and TO units and move the new bogie trams to the suburban lines, but the poor performance of the rebuilt units soon made the company change its mind.|$|E

We {{show that}} the Fibered Isomorphism Conjecture (FIC) of Farrell and Jones {{corresponding}} to the stable topological pseudoisotopy functor <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the fundamental groups of a large class of 3 -manifolds.

25|$|The {{practice}} of medicine in the early Middle Ages was in fact empirical and pragmatic. It focused mainly on curing disease rather than discovering the cause of diseases. Often it was believed the cause of disease was supernatural. Nevertheless, approaches to curing disease existed. People in the Middle Ages considered medicine through {{an understanding of the}} humors. This approach was likely influenced by a largely rural existence in which people understood the influences of the elements of the sustenance of agriculture. Since {{it was clear that the}} fertility of the earth depended on the proper balance of the elements, it followed that the same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the body, within which the various humors, as they were understood, had to be in balance. This approach greatly influenced medical theory throughout the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|To be sure, {{the ethnic}} {{definitions}} were loose categorisations. Overarching politico-ethnic identities {{were still in}} their early stages of development. In the western mainland, even the so-called major ethnic groups—such as Burmans, Mons, Shans—were themselves divided into rival centres, with distinctive local traditions {{and in many cases}} different dialects. The same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> smaller minorities still—indeed, terms like Kachins, Karens, and Chins are exonyms given by Burmans that summarily group several different groups. In the central mainland, the main Siamese, Lao and Yuan ethnicities were still in an embryonic stage, and a chiefly elite concept. In Siam, the Siamese language and ethnicity were the “preserve” of the aristocracy called the munnai, and most commoners in Ayutthaya, according to an early 16th-century Portuguese observer, still spoke Mon dialects rather than still emerging Siamese, and cut their hair like the Mons of Pegu.|$|E

Some regulations were passed in that year and more in 1976 after another, stronger earthquake shook the city. However, none of these regulations had an event like 1985's in mind when passed. Most of the seriously damaged buildings were built between 1957 and 1976, when the city was starting to build upwards, in the six-to-fifteen floor range. In second place were buildings from before 1957, possibly because they were weakened by the earlier earthquakes. Structures built between 1976 and 1985 suffered the least damage.|$|E
