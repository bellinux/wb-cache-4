Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the New <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party</b> and other {{opposition}} political forces have {{announced that they}} are ready to support ElBaradei if he decided to run for the election. However, Mohamed ElBaradei stated that if he decides to run for the 2011 elections, he prefers to run as an independent candidate, rather than running as a candidate of any of the existing political parties.|$|E
25|$|Saad Zaghlul and the <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party</b> led the Egyptian {{nationalist}} movement. The Wafd was {{the first}} organised mass party in Egypt. Although Zaghlul and the Wafd gained {{a majority in the}} Legislative Assembly this did not stop the British exiling Zaghlul and some of his fellow part members to Malta on March 8, 1919. This proved to be the final straw for many and in protest Egyptian society rose to demonstrate against the British in what was the country's first modern Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of the feminist {{movement}} is considered to have taken place between (1923–1939). The Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU) was founded by the former leader of the women's committee in the <b>Wafd</b> <b>party,</b> Hoda Shaarawi. This led to her participation in an international Feminist Conference in Rome and upon her return, along with Nabawiyya Musa and Ceza Nabarwi, Shaarawi caused outrage in the gesture that she made against the Egyptian authorities and traditions by throwing her veil into the sea. This act caused a particular scandal for Shaarawi was the wife of an eminent Pasha. However she was able to inspire other women to cast off their veils.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party's</b> resounding victory {{meant that}} King Fuad I {{had no choice}} but to ask Zaghloul to form a new government. He did so on 27 January, and Zaghloul was named Prime Minister of Egypt. The Wafd felt it had a mandate to {{conclude}} a treaty with the United Kingdom that would assure Egypt complete independence. As prime minister, Zaghloul carefully selected a cross-section of Egyptian society for his cabinet, which he called the [...] "People's Ministry." [...] On 15 March 1924, King Fuad opened the first Egyptian constitutional parliament amid national rejoicing. The Wafdist government did not last long, however.|$|R
50|$|On 23 September 1945, {{after the}} end of World War II, the Egyptian {{government}} demanded the modification of the treaty to terminate the British military presence, and also to allow the annexation of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Following the <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party's</b> victory in the boycotted 1950 election of Egypt, the new Wafd government unilaterally abrogated the treaty in October 1951. Three years later, and with new government leadership under Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, the UK agreed to withdraw its troops in the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954; the British withdrawal was completed in June 1956. This date is seen as when Egypt gained full independence, although Nasser had already established an independent foreign policy that caused tension with several Western powers.|$|R
5000|$|During {{its heyday}} in the 1930s Young Egypt's [...] "Green Shirts" [...] had some violent {{confrontations}} with the <b>Wafd</b> <b>party's</b> [...] "blue shirts." [...] One member {{even tried to}} assassinate Mustafa el-Nahas Pasha in November 1937. Under government pressure, the Green shirts were disbanded in 1938. The group was renamed the Nationalist Islamic Party in 1940, when it took on a more religious, as well as anti-British tone. After the war it was renamed yet again, now the Socialist Party of Egypt. The group's one electoral success came when it sent Ibrahim Shukri, its vice-president to parliament in 1951. However it was disbanded, along with all other parties, in 1953 following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.|$|R
25|$|In Egypt, the <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party</b> ("Delegation Party") was a {{nationalist}} liberal political party in Egypt. It {{was said to}} be Egypt's most popular and influential political party for a period in the 1920s and 30s. Although the efforts of liberal nationalists culminated in the formation of a constitutional monarchy with the Egyptian Constitution of 1923, liberal nationalism declined in the late 1930s due the growth and opposition of two movements, the Muslim Brotherhood and Pan-Arab nationalism. However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas. Prominent liberals during the period were Taha Hussein, Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, Tawfiq al-Hakim, Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri, Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri and Muhammad Mandur.|$|E
25|$|The 6th World Congress also {{revised the}} policy of united front in the colonial world. In 1927 the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese Communists, {{which led to a}} review of the policy on forming alliances with the {{national}} bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The congress did however make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swarajist Party and the Egyptian <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party</b> on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable ally but not a direct enemy. The congress called on the Indian Communists to utilize the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists.|$|E
25|$|The New <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party</b> stated on 27 January 2014 that {{it would}} not {{nominate}} anyone for presidency. The Free Egyptians Party announced on 27 April 2014 {{that it would}} not nominate any members to presidential elections. Adly Mansour, stated in November 2013 that he would not run. Amr Moussa, who finished fifth in the 2012 presidential election, has stated that he would not run for the presidency. The Nour Party did not nominate anyone for the presidency. Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, who finished fourth in the 2012 election, announced on 9 February 2014 that he would not run. On 13 March, Lieutenant General Sami Anan announced he will not run for president.|$|E
5000|$|After student demonstrations {{against the}} Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the anti-labor {{policies}} of the government began to reveal cracks in the previously ironclad <b>Wafd</b> coalition, <b>party</b> leaders created a youth wing dubbed the [...] "Blue Shirts." [...] However, rather than capitalizing on the grassroots nature of the youth movements, the party instead tried to slot the Blue Shirts onto their own rung in the top-down Wafd hierarchy, presenting members with uniforms, badges, and a standardized salute - all under the motto [...] "Obedience & Struggle." [...] By June 1937, the Wafd feared that the Blue Shirts were becoming too militant, and thereafter further restricted their privileges. Having never fully embraced youth mobilization, by {{the close of the}} 1930s the uneasy Wafd leadership had essentially abandoned any efforts at intergenerational coalition-building.|$|R
5000|$|Easily the {{greatest}} {{factor contributing to}} popular disillusionment with the <b>Wafd</b> was the <b>party's</b> failure to boycott the Farouk government after it acceded to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The policies followed by the party during the Anglo-Egyptian crisis of the mid-1930s alienated many Egyptian nationalists - heretofore the single most reliable support bloc for the Wafd - and severed the party between its small but powerful accommodationist minority and its large but voiceless resistant majority. The failure of the Wafd to more aggressively oppose {{the continuation of the}} British presence [...] "left Egyptian politics devoid of a popularly legitimized leader or party." ...|$|R
25|$|Both the People and National parties came to {{dominate}} Egyptian politics until World War I, {{but the new}} leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British protectorate) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed and the People's Party. Prominent among these was Saad Zaghlul who led the new movement through the <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party.</b> Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before {{he was elected to}} the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to Malta, the Egyptian people staged their first modern revolution. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} notable men, {{famous for their}} ideas and writing frequented the {{literary}} salons {{and contributed to the}} discussions.

500|$|In the 1950 {{parliamentary}} elections, the <b>Wafd</b> <b>Party</b> of el-Nahhas {{gained a}} victory—mostly {{due to the}} absence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which boycotted the elections—and was perceived as a threat by the Free Officers as the Wafd had campaigned on demands similar to their own. Accusations of corruption against Wafd politicians began to surface, however, breeding an atmosphere of rumor and suspicion that consequently brought the Free Officers to the forefront of Egyptian politics. By then, the organization had expanded to around ninety members; according to Khaled Mohieddin, [...] "nobody knew all of them and where they belonged in the hierarchy except Nasser". Nasser felt that the Free Officers were not ready to move against the government and, for nearly two years, he did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins.|$|E
