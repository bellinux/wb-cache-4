Temporal variance of the surface <b>wind</b> <b>components</b> at each individual grid point was "band passed " (approximately 2. 5 - 6 days) using the filtering procedure of Blackmon (1976). Both the original winds and the time-filtered <b>wind</b> <b>components</b> were used to calculate the cube of the friction velocity and the wind stress curl. Monthly mean maps of uo 3 from the filtered <b>wind</b> <b>components</b> show clearly the location and intensity of the monthly mean synoptic storm activity during this period. Also, this measure of the synoptic storm activity was qualitatively related to the monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies as analyzed by Namias.

This yawing motion along the bullet's flight path means that the nose of the bullet points in a slightly different direction from the direction the bullet travels.

(ii) For each individual region, the spectral dependence on wavenumber is nearly the same for both velocity components and for kinetic energy.
