The inverter, NAND, NOR and flip-flop <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> {{based on the}} gate-length biasing technique are proposed to achieve low Energy Delay Product (EDP).

The proposed several <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> attain large leakage reductions. A mode- 10 counter is verified with the proposed <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> by using commercial EDA tools. The leakage and total dynamic power dissipations of the mode- 10 counter using the proposed <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> provide a reduction of 21. 27 and 3. 06 %, respectively.

50|$|In {{digital circuit}} design, a {{dedicated}} <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> library is employed for each manufacturing technology (e.g., CMOS). The <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> library comprises many different logic gates, for example a NAND gate. For each logical type of logic gate, e.g., a two-input NAND, there usually exist different physical realizations in the <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> library, for instance with different output drive strengths.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> have been widely used to {{implement}} VLSI circuits in the automation of physical design. Since one major aim of a cell-based design is to minimize total layout area in a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> placement, the number of feedthrough cells will be minimized to reduce total cell area in a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> placement. In this paper, first, we model a partitioning-based row assignment (PRA) problem to minimize the number of feedthrough <b>cells</b> in a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> placement. Furthermore, an integer linear programming (ILP) approach is proposed to solve the PRA problem in a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> placement. Finally, the ILP approach has been implemented and two standard-cell netlists, Primary 1 and Primary 2, have been tested by the proposed approach, Bose's approach [4] and an exhaustive search approach, respectively. The experimental results show that the ILP approach obtains fewer feedthrough cells than Bose's approach in a partitioning-based <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> placement...|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} and market {{idea behind the}} foundation of NanGate was to address and solve the inherent shortcomings of <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> based ASSP/ASIC design as compared to full custom IC design. In <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> design the designer uses <b>cells</b> from a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> library to implement the desired logic functionality of the IC while trying to obtain the target operating frequency at the lowest possible cost in terms of die area and power consumption. The <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> form the basic building blocks used to build the IC together with macro blocks such as embedded memory, Input-Output (IO), mixed-signal and analog blocks. Each <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> represents a relatively primitive logic function, such as a NAND gate, with fixed area, timing and power characteristics and is constructed from transistors most often arranged in the pull-up/pull-down fashion of CMOS. A typical standard-cell library for e.g. 40 nanometer CMOS has 500-1500 <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> and about 150-300 different logic functions.|$|R
40|$|The LSI <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> array {{technique}} {{was used in}} the fabrication of more than 20 CMOS custom arrays. This technique consists of a series of computer programs and design automation techniques referred to as the Computer Aided Design And Test (CADAT) system that automatically translate a partitioned logic diagram into a set of instructions for driving an automatic plotter which generates precision mask artwork for complex LSI arrays of CMOS <b>standard</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> concept for producing LSI arrays begins with the design, layout, and validation of a group of custom circuits called <b>standard</b> <b>cells.</b> Once validated, these cells are given identification or pattern numbers and are permanently stored. To use one of these cells in a logic design, the user calls for the desired cell by pattern number. The Place, Route in Two Dimension (PR 2 D) computer program is then used to automatically generate the metalization and/or tunnels to interconnect the <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> into the required function. Data sheets that describe the function, artwork, and performance of each of the <b>standard</b> <b>cells,</b> the general procedure for implementation of logic in CMOS <b>standard</b> <b>cells,</b> and additional detailed design information are presented...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{a number}} of other CAD tools may be used to {{validate}} other aspects of the cell views and models.

All of these files that are created to support the use of all of the <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> variations are collectively known as a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> library.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” Semi-custom design flows are a {{key factor}} for {{the rapid growth of}} {{integrated}} circuits and systems. They lower design complexity through the use of pre-designed and pre-characterized functional components called <b>standard</b> <b>cells,</b> instead of assuming that designers have to draw, place and connect each transistor. In this way, modeling of complex systems is easier. As CMOS technologies evolve into deep submicron nodes, asynchronous techniques gain relevance in the research community, due to their ability to cope with problems that are hard to solve with the synchronous para-digm. However, several specific components required in asyn-chronous designs are not available in commercial <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> libraries, which constrains asynchronous design to use approaches close to full-custom ones. This limits modularity and increases design complexity. Thus, one of the possibilities for enabling further advance of the asynchronous paradigm is the availability of asynchronous <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> libraries. Albeit industrial tools provide reasonable support to asynchronous <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> physical design, the characterization of these <b>cells</b> using <b>standard</b> tools is usually quite laborious. This work proposes the Library Characterization Environment (Li-ChEn), an open source tool applicable to automatically char-acterize typical asynchronous <b>standard</b> <b>cells.</b> The tool man-aged to successfully characterize a <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> library with over five hundred asynchronous components.

40|$|In this paper, {{issues related}} to the {{physical}} design and layout density of FinFET <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> are discussed. Analysis significantly extends previous analyses, which considered the simplistic case of a single FinFET device or extremely simple circuits. Results show that analysis of a single device cannot predict the layout density of FinFET cells, due to the additional spacing constraints imposed by the <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> structure. Results on the layout density of FinFET <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> circuits are derived by building and analyzing various cell libraries in 32 -nm technology, based on 3 T and four-terminal (4 T) devices, {{as well as on the}} recently proposed cells with mixed 3 T- 4 T devices (MT). The results obtained for spacer- and lithography-defined FinFETs are observed from the technology scaling perspective by also considering 45 -nm and 65 -nm libraries. The effect of the fin and cell height on the layout density is studied. Results show that that 3 T and MT FinFET <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> can have the same layout density as bulk cells (or better) for low (moderate) fin heights. Instead, 4 T <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> have an unacceptably worse layout density. Hence, MT <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> turn out to be the only viable option to apply back biasing in FinFET <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> circuits...|$|R
50|$|Another {{application}} domain is {{in electronic}} design automation. In <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> design methodology, typically <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> {{have the same}} height, and their placement is arranged {{in a number of}} rows.

5000|$|Logic {{synthesis}} {{transforms the}} RTL design {{into a large}} collection of lower-level constructs called <b>standard</b> <b>cells.</b> These constructs are taken from a standard-cell library consisting of pre-characterized collections of gates (such as 2 input nor, 2 input nand, inverters, etc.). The <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> are typically specific to the planned manufacturer of the ASIC. The resulting collection of <b>standard</b> <b>cells,</b> plus the needed electrical connections between them, is called a gate-level netlist.|$|R

50|$|In {{semiconductor}} design, <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> methodology is {{a method}} of designing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with mostly digital-logic features. <b>Standard</b> <b>cell</b> methodology {{is an example of}} design abstraction, whereby a low-level very-large-scale integration (VLSI) layout is encapsulated into an abstract logic representation (such as a NAND gate). Cell-based methodology â€” the general class to which <b>standard</b> <b>cells</b> belong â€” makes it possible for one designer to focus on the high-level (logical function) aspect of digital design, while another designer focuses on the implementation (physical) aspect. Along with semiconductor manufacturing advances, <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> methodology has helped designers scale ASICs from comparatively simple single-function ICs (of several thousand gates), to complex multi-million gate system-on-a-chip (SoC) devices.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPortable/Implantable {{biomedical}} applications usually exhibit stringent power {{budgets for}} prolonging battery life time, but loose operating frequency requirements due to small bio-signal bandwidths, typically below a few kHz.
