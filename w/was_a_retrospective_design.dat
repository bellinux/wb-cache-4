The study <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>design</b> and {{was approved by}} the ethics committee in Tongji Hospital at the Tongji Medical College, and performed strictly following the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Visual field testing and others ophthalmologic examinations including slit-lamp, BCVA, intraocular pressure, and fundus examination of all patients were reviewed. Professor Ni evaluated the disease stage for each patient as previously described (Nikoskelainen et al. 1984). Disease were categorized into three stages: onset (within a week), middle stage (between 3 and 6  months), and late stage (over 6  months), the average time of the 3 groups were 0.13  ±  0.06, 4.4  ±  0.88, 10.47  ±  3.4  m respectively.

40|$|Objective: Psychoacoustic {{measures}} of tinnitus, in particular dominant tinnitus pitch {{and its relationship}} to the shape of the audiogram, are important in determining and verifying pathophysiological mechanisms of the condition. Our previous study postulated that this relationship might vary between different groups of people with tinnitus. For a small subset of participants with narrow tinnitus bandwidth, pitch was associated with the audiometric edge, consistent with the tonotopic reorganization theory. The current study objective was to establish this relationship in an independent sample. Design: This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>design</b> using data from five studies conducted between 2008 and 2013. Study sample: From a cohort of 380 participants, a subgroup group of 129 with narrow tinnitus bandwidth were selected. Results: Tinnitus pitch generally fell within the area of hearing loss. There was a statistically significant correlation between dominant tinnitus pitch and edge frequency; higher edge frequency being associated with higher dominant tinnitus pitch. However, similar to our previous study, for the majority of participants pitch was more than an octave above the edge frequency. Conclusions: The findings did not support our prediction and are therefore not consistent with the reorganization theory postulating tinnitus pitch to correspond to the audiometric edge...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityThis study {{investigated}} the long-term analgesic efficacy of opioids and non-opioids for management of chronic low back pain. The goals were to determine if analgesic effects were maintained over time, or if analgesia was reduced {{as a result of}} tolerance and/or hyperalgesia. Another goal was to determine if analgesic efficacy significantly differed between men and women. This study <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>design</b> where data was collected from medical records of patients who have had a primary diagnosis of chronic low back pain and who have been prescribed either opioids (i. e., morphine) or non-opioids (i. e., antidepressants and anticonvulsants) for pain management. Data was collected about the amount of medication use, the pain rating, and the use of secondary medications such as NSAIDs and muscle relaxants. Data was analyzed using latent growth curve modeling, where the initial and slope values of medication use were estimated as growth trajectories, and pain ratings, secondary medication use, and patient sex were modeled as covariates. Results indicated that across time there was minimal significant change in medication use (either opioids or non-opioids) or in pain ratings. There was a significant increase in pain ratings as opioid use increased at the three and six month time points, indicating the possibility that long-term opioid use contributed to the start of hyperalgesia development. No such growth trajectory was observed with non-opioid use,indicating that opioids may uniquely contribute to hyperalgesia across time. Results also revealed that NSAID use in combination with non-opioids significantly decreased non-opioid use across time, thus NSAIDs may facilitate analgesic efficacy of non-opioids. No significant sex differences were observed in medication use or in pain levels over time, suggesting that men and women have similar patterns of medication use and pain levels. In sum, these results suggest that over time, both opioids and non-opioids do not provide a significant improvement in reducing pain levels for men and women with chronic low back pain. However, this was a clinical study with a heterogeneous sample and many external variables that could offer additional or alternative results and deserve consideration in future studies.

40|$|Foetal origins {{theory has}} {{suggested}} that early environment can affect vulnerability to major diseases in later life. Recent research also suggests that foetal hormonal programming may influence neurotransmitter and hormone levels affecting adult psychological states (i. e. depression and general self-efficacy). However, investigations into early environment and depression have focused on hospitalised or elderly participants, using non-standard measures. This study investigates links between birthweight and depression in a non clinical adult population, as well as links with general self-efficacy and depression. METHODS: This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>design.</b> 100 participants mean age 25. 9 self reported birthweight, current height and weight to allow computation of BMI. A General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were also completed. The official classification of low birthweight (2. 5 kg) and the median weight for the group (3. 26 kg) were used to identify three groups. FINDINGS: One way ANOVA showed that variance in depression [F = 5. 31, (2, 97) p =. 006] and lower general self-efficacy [F = 4. 04, (2, 96) p =. 021] is explained by membership of birthweight group.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} of the study are to (1) document the incidence of veterans who prematurely terminate physical therapy before medically indicated, and (2) identify reliable predictors of treatment retention and attrition. The potential benefit {{of this study is}} the identification of reliable variables that predict who is at risk for terminating physical therapy prematurely, which may lead to targeted interventions designed to increase treatment retention. RESEARCH DESIGN: This study will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>design</b> involving <b>a</b> review of medical records of veterans receiving referral to physical therapy. METHODOLOGY: Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) will be used {{to examine the effects of}} patient variables (e. g,. demographics), illness variables (e. g., symptom severity, functional impairment), and treatment variables (e. g., length and frequency of sessions) on treatment retention status (i. e., successful completion, premature termination with good reason, or premature termination without good reason). Because this study involves a review of records, there is no clinic setting in which participants are recruited. However, patient cases to be reviewed involve those referred for physical therapy, regardless of on which inpatient unit they reside. Approximately 300 - 800 patient cases will be reviewed, to remain consistent with the literature on studies using MLR. Patient cases will be selected if they meet the following inclusion criteria (1) referred for physical therapy; (2) cognitively intact at time of referral (i. e., no indication of delirium or dementia); (3) able to make medical decisions (i. e., no activated DPOA); and not actively dying (i. e., no Karnofski Performance Scale score below 30).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{patterns}} of referral between primary and specialty care providers among Medicare beneficiaries {{and to identify}} correlates of the probability of referral. DATA SOURCES: The 1992 and 1993 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), including associated claims data. MCBS data {{are linked to the}} Area Resource File (ARF) and the Physician Identification Master Record (PIMR). STUDY DESIGN: This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>design</b> using cross-sectional descriptive and multivariate correlational analysis. Estimates are made for two years. Key variables include two alternative definitions of referrals, patient socio-demographic and health status, physician characteristics, and county-level descriptors. DATA COLLECTION: The MCBS <b>is</b> <b>a</b> panel survey of a stratified random sample of Medicare beneficiaries begun in 1991. The data are linked to Medicare claims records for survey respondents. The ARF <b>is</b> <b>a</b> health resources data set that contains more than 7, 000 variables at the county level, including information on health facilities, health professions, services resources and utilization, and socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. The PIMR <b>is</b> <b>a</b> record of all physicians in the United States and describes their professional characteristics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The overall rate of physician referrals in the MCBS, approximately 10 percent, is higher than that found in prior research, as is the level of self-referral to specialists at about 70 percent. Depending on the dependent variable definition, between 60 and 85 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries had at least one referral, and the average number of referrals per person per year was greater than two. Referrals show a multi-directional pattern rather than a simple pattern of primary to specialty care, with referrals between primary care physicians, referrals between specialists, and referrals from specialty to primary care being not uncommon. Strong predictors of referral include patient health and patient insurance coverage and income. Physician factors do not contribute much to explaining referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare referral patterns are similar to those found in other studies. Patient factors appear to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more important factor in explaining referrals than was estimated from prior research. Additional research is needed to explain the more complex dynamics of referral patterns...|$|R

Work on Xunet 2 began in 1989 and the network, consisting of experimental ATM switches, IP routers, and 45 Mbps transmission lines, has been operational since October 1991. The network serves as a "laboratory without walls" for eight research groups across the United States. While Xunet 2 has {{only a small number of}} nodes, it <b>was</b> designed as <b>a</b> prototype of a nationwide ATM network. This paper reviews some of the design decisions and lessons learned in the project and points out the research directions motivated by this work, focusing on the areas of traffic management, ATM switch design, network control, and the implementation of an IP router. 1. Introduction The Experimental University Network (Xunet) program began in 1986 when AT&T Bell Laboratories formed a research collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{high levels of}} client {{drop-out}} in drug and alcohol treatment is frequently reported in the literature. In the course of conducting an evaluation of a specialist women 2 ̆ 7 s treatment service, the inadequacy of the data on women-specific predictors of treatment drop-out <b>was</b> highlighted. Using <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>design,</b> the characteristics of 160 women who left treatment less than 5 days after admission were compared to the 160 women who stayed longer than 5 days and {{were enrolled in the}} evaluation study. The findings of this study suggested that women who <b>were</b> employed, had <b>a</b> history of sexual assault (especially in adulthood), nominated alcohol as their drug of choice, were not married, older than 25 years of age and had demonstrated a sympathy with the agency 2 ̆ 7 s treatment philosophy were less likely to drop-out of treatment. In addition, for lesbian women, women with a history of sexual assault in childhood, and those with dependent children, attendance at a specialist women 2 ̆ 7 s service reduced the incidence of treatment drop-out...|$|R
40|$|This study <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective,</b> two group <b>design</b> that {{obtained}} 231 potential {{subjects from}} 16 physicians. Questionnaires {{were mailed to}} subjects 6 months post lumbar laminotomy, discectomy or microdiscectomy surgery. One-hundred and one subjects, 57 male, 40 female, and 4 unknown {{with a mean age}} of 42. 09 were divided into 2 groups. Group A (51 subjects) did not receive physical therapy following discharge from the hospital. Group B (50 subjects) obtained physical therapy or went to back school following discharge. The questionnaire investigated 4 main aspects of patient recovery: perceived pain, use of pain medications, return to work status and activities of daily living. No statistical significance was found between the two groups based on the 4 main aspects of patient recovery. Because the selection for physical therapy or no physical therapy was not based upon random selection, we cannot compare the two groups and cannot conclude that physical therapy is or is not beneficial...|$|R
40|$|The {{foundation}} {{for the present study}} was based on the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2001), Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) 2004, and Florida Response to Intervention (RTI) (Florida RTI, 2009). In line with the NCLB Act, Florida requires students to pass the reading portion of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) on grade level in order to graduate (FL-DOE, 2001). In alignment with the RTI framework, READ 180 is presently being implemented as a Tier 2 intervention with adolescent struggling readers across the nation. The methodology for this research <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> research <b>design,</b> with the use of multiple regression and logistic regression models which are consistent with the purpose. Neither of the analyses indicated a significant relationship between READ 180 and the attainment of the minimum yearly gain on the developmental scale score (DSS) of the reading portion of the FCAT. The data analyses supported previous research results indicating that students who are identified as White, from non-low SES families, and not identified with a disability, have more academic success. The results indicated that the regular classroom with reading strategies instruction was just as effective for promoting reading achievement as the separate classroom with specific reading instruction. Because students who participated in the intensive reading intervention forfeit the opportunity to participate in other courses, policy makers and educators need to weigh carefully {{the costs and benefits of}} such programs...|$|R
40|$|Case-control {{studies are}} used in {{epidemiology}} to try to uncover the causes of diseases, but <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>retrospective</b> study <b>design</b> known to suffer from non-participation and recall bias, which may explain their decreased popularity in recent years. Traditional analyses report usually only the odds ratio for given exposures and the binary disease status. Chain event graphs <b>are</b> <b>a</b> graphical representation of a statistical model derived from event trees which have been developed in artificial intelligence and statistics, and only recently introduced to the epidemiology literature. They <b>are</b> <b>a</b> modern Bayesian technique which enable prior knowledge to {{be incorporated into the}} data analysis using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, used to form a suitable chain event graph. Additionally, they can account for missing data and be used to explore missingness mechanisms. Here we adapt the chain event graph framework to suit scenarios often encountered in case-control studies, to strengthen this study design which is time and financially efficient. We demonstrate eight adaptations to the graphs, which consist of two suitable for full case-control study analysis, four which can be used in interim analyses to explore biases, and two which aim to improve the ease and accuracy of analyses. The adaptations are illustrated with complete, reproducible, fully-interpreted examples, including the event tree and chain event graph. Chain event graphs are used {{here for the first time}} to summarise non-participation, data collection techniques, data reliability, and disease severity in case-control studies. We demonstrate how these features of a case-control study can be incorporated into the analysis to provide further insight, which can help to identify potential biases and lead to more accurate study results...|$|R
