5|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for the Moon's formation 4.51 billion years ago, and some 60 million years after {{the origin of the}} Solar System. These mechanisms included the fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force (<b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> too great an initial spin of Earth), the gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon (<b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon), and the co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk (which does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon). These hypotheses also cannot account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2012, Puerto Rican Governor Luis Fortuño {{signed the}} project for a Legislative Reform that would {{reduce the number of}} legislators. According to Fortuño, this would result in a {{decrease}} in the expenses associated with the operation of the Legislative Assembly. To achieve this, the constitution has to be amended, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> a referendum to the people.|$|E
5|$|Purchase the Puma (IFV) – More lethal {{than the}} GCV, combat {{survival}} and protection at better rates, {{and just as}} mobile. Purchasing the Puma would save $14.8 billion and was considered the most capable of the vehicles. Puma IFVs only carry six infantrymen, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys. Development and production would require collaboration with foreign companies and governments.|$|E

5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon {{on the third}} day. Australia batted {{strongly}} and on the fourth day, Johnson came in at 6/445, with Australia already ahead by 580. He made nine before his partner Ray Lindwall was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460. This left England a victory target of 596, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> a world record run chase.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad. Following consultation with the British government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war effort would be {{in the form of an}} infantry division, the 2nd New Zealand Division, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> nine battalions of infantry. Consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

Shortly after, Nikki went on a hiatus from both television and in-ring competition due to a neck injury <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> surgery, but returned for one night on December 21, to accept the Slammy Award for Diva of the Year. During this time, Brie continued to compete in singles competition, and in tag team matches with Fox.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1843, the {{infantry}} led by Colonel Dimitris Kallergis and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of the Athens City Council General Yiannis Makriyiannis assembled in Palace Square {{in front of}} the Palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much {{of the population of the}} small capital, the rebellion refused to disperse until the King agreed to grant a Constitution, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Flammen's death was challenged by Danish National Archives's Peter Birkelund. In the film Flammen commits suicide {{in the basement}} of his house after the Gestapo find him, presumably because of Ketty's betrayal. Birkelund, however, says Flammen was killed on a coastal road while the Gestapo was looking for another resistance member. In contrast, the filming of Citron's death, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> 250 soldiers, was consciously altered by Madsen for budgetary reasons.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} design planned for most theater patrons {{to enter the}} theater from the underground parking garage, but the success of Millennium Park and neighboring businesses has caused most attendees to enter at street level. The design's limited elevator service has caused bottlenecks for street level patrons. Additional elevators and escalators, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> special dedicated funding, have been considered. The initial construction leaked and did not protect some non-public spaces from water exposure; this cost Chicago taxpayers $1million for repairs in 2008.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Medal of Honor, {{one for each of}} the military departments of the Department of Defense: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version. Each is constructed differently and the components are made from gilding metals and red brass alloys with some gold plating, enamel, and bronze pieces. The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> the Medal of Honor to be made with 90% gold, the same composition as the lesser-known Congressional Gold Medal, but the measure was dropped.|$|E
5|$|A Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, Mass Effect was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the Mass Effect Trilogy compilation. In 2015, Mass Effect was added to the list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 Heber {{accepted}} {{the post of}} canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties {{to be carried out}} without interfering with his parish work. His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor; the works, with Heber's critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber's life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness. Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood. In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> a regular term of residence in London. He saw this both as an extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centuries}} that {{followed}} the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched {{by the fact that}} several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> a highly specialized degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.|$|E
5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} granted a {{production}} budget of $60 million, with $30 million funded by New Regency. Brett Ratner's RatPac-Dune Entertainment, {{a joint venture between}} Ratner's RatPac Entertainment and 20th Century Fox's former financing partner, Dune Entertainment, also funded the film. Worldview Entertainment, who also co-financed Birdman, was originally set to fund the film but backed out in July 2014 due to the departure of its CEO, Christopher Woodrow. New Regency approached 20th Century Fox for additional funding, but the company declined, citing the pay-or-play contracts made for both DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>require</b> that the actors be paid regardless of whether the film is completed. Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison entered negotiations to finance the film shortly after. The Chinese company Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Company partially financed the film.|$|E
