5|$|Throughout the book, Chomsky {{discusses}} {{what the}} Occupy movement {{is and what}} it is demanding, as well as advocating ways in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> gain greater support and achieve governmental reforms, using historical examples as evidence. Press reviews were largely positive, with some noting that Chomsky had taken a more moderate, reformist position than they expected of him.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several ways in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not easily be recovered.|$|E

5|$|Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus {{speculated that}} the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He {{believed}} that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology {{to the concept of}} an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not cause resistance to the motions of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies moved.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{remained}} in the Admiralty Islands until October, when it boarded ships there for the invasion of Leyte, which it assaulted on 20 October 1944. Chase's 1st Brigade's initial mission was to reconnoiter the hills {{on the west side}} of the Tacloban Valley and establish observation posts from <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> command the entrances to the valley. In November, he was ordered to cover the flank of X Corps' advance up the Leyte Valley, and later into the Ormoc Valley. Chase had to move his brigade across mountainous, roadless, uncharted jungle in frequently appalling wet weather. The advance made slow progress against Japanese troops that fought tenaciously all the way.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations lacked {{an armed}} force {{of its own}} and {{depended}} on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do. Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action {{on behalf of the}} League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, {{while at the same time}} advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> uphold its authority.|$|E

5|$|The {{first season}} saw them finish runners-up, but the club's {{management}} declined {{to apply for}} promotion back into the Southern League and so they remained in the Wessex League. In the following three seasons they were placed seventh, ninth and sixth, but 1997–98 saw the club finish runners-up again, winning promotion back to the Southern League. Returning after a five-year absence, {{it was not long}} before the difference in quality between the two leagues became evident, and the club soon realised that it was unable to compete financially with the bigger clubs in the division. At {{the beginning of the year}} the club announced its intention to return to the Wessex League for 1999–2000, a decision taken because it was felt it would be better to play in a league in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> compete financially and successfully.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the speed with <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's rule radically {{changed the}} {{landscape}} of Galilee. With the restoration and re-fortification of Acre {{and the establishment of}} the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world. Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained the cotton monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on the cotton trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.|$|E

5|$|After Andrianampoinimerina reunited {{the divided}} and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he {{successfully}} pursued an expansionist policy that saw his authority extended {{over a large}} portion of Madagascar by {{the time of his death}} in 1810. Having captured Antananarivo by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which he alone was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E

5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the satiric edge off.|$|E
5|$|The mutiny refocused {{attention}} on the long term tension {{over the use of}} Indochinese soldiers, and on the ways in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be resolved. The tension could {{be traced back to the}} creation of French Indochina. Cochinchina, the European term for southern Vietnam, had been colonised in 1867 and the remaining parts of Vietnam, Tonkin and Annam, the northern and central regions were conquered in 1883. Nominally, only Cochinchina was a colony, while Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia and Laos were protectorates which together comprised French Indochina. The problem centred around the French reliance on native soldiers to maintain colonial control. This need was problematic because Indo-Chinese soldiers were both enforcers of colonial order and colonial subjects. This created constant French concerns about their loyalty. Despite several attempts to deal with the issue, the basic tension between the need for and suspicion of native troops could never be entirely resolved. The need for forces to pacify the countryside was too pressing to do without them. As a result, the tension resurfaced at regular intervals, either due to proposals to improve the position of Indochinese soldiers in the army, or after a mutiny had raised question marks about the loyalty of the soldiers.|$|E
