In {{the second half of the}} 1800s, railroads began to be built in the watershed. Heavy industries and fisheries also began to appear in the area around this time.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, the United States Federal Government {{granted the}} Portland <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mills</b> {{contracts}} for wool blankets. In 1943, the factory won a Army-Navy [...] "E" [...] Award for their production. By 1950, the Portland <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mills</b> {{had become the}} largest wool manufacturer in the United States west of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1951, the Portland <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mills</b> won a US$200,000 contract for the United States Armed Forces. From its 1935 to 1952, the Portland <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mills</b> were led by executive director Charles H. Carter, who died two years after his retirement. His son Charles H. Carter, Jr. succeed him in that position. In 1960, the Portland <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mills</b> announced it would cease operations. At {{the time of the}} closure, the factory employed 100 people.

50|$|Founded in 1865, the Faribault <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mills</b> {{stayed in}} {{continuous}} operation until 2009. Reopened in 2011, {{it is one}} of few remaining vertical <b>woolen</b> <b>mills</b> in the United States, taking raw wool and producing finished goods.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} company that built the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge, T. B. White and Sons, {{was established in}} 1868. Its founder Timothy B. White had been a carpenter and contractor in New Brighton, Pennsylvania since the 1840s. White also operated factories for iron cars and <b>woolen</b> <b>mill</b> machinery until 1859, {{when he began to}} concentrate solely on bridge construction. White's bridge company operated from a factory on the Beaver River in New Brighton until the factory was destroyed by fire in 1878. After the fire, the company relocated across the river to Beaver Falls and restructured as the Penn Bridge and Machine Works. In addition to iron truss bridges, the company produced a range of structural and architectural components and continued to expand; it employed over 500 workers by 1908. Penn Bridge and Machine Works fended off purchase by the American Bridge Company and continued to operate independently, unlike similar small bridge companies founded in the 19th century. The most prolific {{of its kind in the}} Pittsburgh region, the company was responsible for the construction of bridges throughout the United States.|$|E
5|$|The next {{transport}} of sheep to North America {{was not until}} 1607, with the voyage of the Susan Constant to Virginia. However, the sheep that arrived in that year were all slaughtered because of a famine, and a permanent flock was not to reach the colony until two years later in 1609. In two decades' time, the colonists had expanded their flock {{to a total of}} 400 head. By the 1640s there were about 100,000 head of sheep in the 13 colonies, and in 1662, a <b>woolen</b> <b>mill</b> was built in Watertown, Massachusetts. Especially during the periods of political unrest and civil war in Britain spanning the 1640s and 1650s which disrupted maritime trade, the colonists found it pressing to produce wool for clothing. Many islands off the coast were cleared of predators and set aside for sheep: Nantucket, Long Island, Martha's Vineyard and small islands in Boston Harbor were notable examples. There remain some rare breeds of American sheep—such as the Hog Island sheep—that were the result of island flocks. Placing semi-feral sheep and goats on islands was common practice in colonization during this period. Early on, the British government banned further export of sheep to the Americas, or wool from it, in an attempt to stifle any threat to the wool trade in the British Isles. One of many restrictive trade measures that precipitated the American Revolution, the sheep industry in the Northeast grew despite the bans.|$|E
25|$|Thar {{region of}} Rajasthan {{is the biggest}} wool-producing area in India. Chokla, Marwari, Jaisalmeri, Magra, Malpuri, Sonadi, Nali and Pungal breeds of sheep {{are found in the}} region.

The wool of Chokla breed of sheep is considered of superior quality. The breeding centres have been developed for Karakul and Merino sheep at Suratgarh, Jaitsar and Bikaner. Some important mills for making Woolen thread established in desert area are: Jodhpur <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mill,</b> Jodhpur; Rajasthan <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mill,</b> Bikaner and India <b>Woolen</b> <b>Mill,</b> Bikaner.
