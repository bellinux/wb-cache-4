60|$|The French {{coffee is}} reputed {{the best in}} the world; and a {{thousand}} voices have asked, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> French coffee? In the first place, then, the French coffee is coffee, and not chicory, or rye, or beans, or peas. In the second place, it is freshly roasted, whenever made,--roasted with great care and evenness in a little revolving cylinder which makes part of the furniture of every kitchen, and which keeps in the aroma of the berry. It is never overdone, so as to destroy the coffee flavor, which is in nine cases out of ten the fault of the coffee we meet with. Then it is ground, and placed in a coffee-pot with a filter, through which it percolates in clear drops--the coffee-pot standing on a heated stove to maintain the temperature. The nose of the coffee-pot is stopped up to prevent the escape of the aroma during this process. The extract thus obtained is a perfectly clear, dark fluid, know as café noir, or black coffee. It is black only because of its strength, being in fact almost the very essential oil of coffee. A tablespoonful of this in boiled milk would make what is ordinarily called a strong cup of coffee. The boiled milk is prepared with no less care. It must be fresh and new, not merely warmed or even brought to the boiling point, but slowly simmered till it attains a thick, creamy richness. The coffee mixed with this, and sweetened with that sparkling beet-root sugar which ornaments a French table, is the celebrated café-au-lait, the name of which has gone round the world.|$|E

40|$|From the introduction] Since 1768, circuses {{have been}} {{dazzling}} audiences around the world. Bringing together acts {{from every corner}} of the globe, circuses have long been associated with astonishing feats and an alluring atmosphere. There is a quality about the circus that people can’t help being drawn to. Some circus lovers attempt to define this quality: “There is that immediacy, the electricity in the air, the idea that real people are doing real things in real time. The [circus] ring is primitive and embedded into our psyche” (“History of the Circus”). For other circus goers, the source of the pull is less concrete. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> circus that is so magnetic? Does it echo something already a part of us, or does it respond to some unspoken need inside us? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> circus that sparks recognition in the human psyche? Is it the costumes and performers, or the allure of the music and ambiance? The mysterious draw to the circus is similar to the draw that attracts us to certain people; this intangible quality was used to explore aspects of personality and human behaviors and motivations in The Spectacle. The allure of the circus and my curiosity about various personality theories inspired my concept for the work, The Spectacle...|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research has been undertaken to establish how end users interpret, understand and verify data models often with the motivation of improving understanding, accuracy and completeness. However, there is relatively little research examining how and why humans make categorisation decisions when developing information systems. The research question addressed in this paper is: <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> human mind that allows it to categorise concepts {{in a particular way}} for conceptual data modelling? From a cognitive psychology perspective Lakoff’s (1987) image schema structures provide answers to such questions.

In addition a case example is used to illustrate the problems with utilising the objectivist approach to categorisation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recent PDP {{models have}} been shown to have great promise in {{contributing}} {{to the understanding of the}} mechanisms which subserve language processing. In this paper we address the specific question of how multiply embedded sentences might be processed. It has been shown experimentally that comprehension of center-embedded structures is poor relative to right-branching structures. It also has been demonstrated that this effect can be attenuated, such that the presence of semantically constrained lexical items in center-embedded sentences improves processing performance. This raises two questions: (1) <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> processing mechanism that makes center-embedded sentences relatively difficult? (2) How are the effects of semantic bias accounted for? Following an approach outlined in Elman (1990, 1991), we train a simple recurrent network in a prediction task on various syntactic structures, including center-embedded and right-branching sentences. As the results show, the behavior of [...] ...|$|E

While Bell inequalities put into question the reality of states, modern device-independent approaches {{do away with the}} idea of entities: physical theory may contain no physical systems. Focusing on the correlations between operationally defined inputs and outputs, device-independent methods promote a view more distant from the conventional one than Einstein's 'principle theories' were from 'constructive theories'. On the examples of indefinite causal orders and almost quantum correlations, we ask a puzzling question: if physical theory is not about systems, then <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>about?</b> <b>The</b> answer given by the device-independent models is that physics is about languages.

40|$|Africa is {{beginning}} to capture the imagination of entrepreneurs, corporate executives, and scholars as an emerging market of new growth opportunities. Over 15 years, the continent has experienced an average growth rate of 5 % (World Economic Forum, 2015 : v).

Although there are regional differences, the primary drivers of growth have been rapidly emerging consumer markets, regional economic integration, investment in infrastructure, technological leap-frogging, and the opening up of new markets, especially in the service sector. African economies also face commensurate challenges. Across the continent, economies remain largely agrarian, underpinned by resource-driven growth and still dominated by the informal sector.
