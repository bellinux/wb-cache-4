40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with {{both men and women}} and women <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with a man in the 3 months before and <b>having</b> at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. RESULTS: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women <b>had</b> a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine skin temperature changes on the unaffected and affected sides as well as changes in perceived temperature and comfort during a footbath in patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a stroke with consequent sensory impairment. METHODS: The study used a quasi-experimental design in which the results of intervention for patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a stroke and healthy adults were compared. The subjects were 20 patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a stroke with consequent sensory impairment and 20 healthy adults. RESULTS: Before the footbath, the skin temperature of the dorsum of the foot on the affected side of the patient <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a stroke was lower than that of the foot on the unaffected side. Five minutes after the start of the footbath, however, the relationship reversed, with the skin temperature on the affected side increasing in parallel with the water temperature. After the footbath, the dorsum skin temperature on the affected side was again lower than that on the unaffected side. In healthy adults, a difference was found in dorsum skin temperature between the left and right feet. In contrast with patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a stroke, no reversal of the sides was found with the lower and higher temperature. CONCLUSION: Unlike in the healthy adults, the skin temperature of the patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a stroke with consequent sensory impairment was susceptible to changes in the external environment. However, no significant changes in the physiological indices were seen, while perceived temperature and comfort remained at high levels after the footbath...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{postoperative}} alignment and sensory functions {{in patients with}} primary exotropia <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been operated {{at an early age}} ( 7 years). METHODS: In a consecutive retrospective cohort study, 112 patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a surgical intervention for primary exotropia between 1997 and 2003 were evaluated for postoperative results. After applying criteria for eligibility, the group of patients was divided into two groups: those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> surgery before the age of seven years (n = 24) and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> surgery after the age of seven years (n = 36). Age at surgery, preoperative alignment and sensory functions were correlated with the postoperative status. The follow-up was at least one year (1. 0 year to 7 years; median: 2. 3 and 3. 5 years, respectively). RESULTS: Patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> surgery before the age of seven <b>had</b> significantly better alignment and sensory functions. The univariate logistic regression model confirmed a statistically significant association between motor outcome (exodeviation less than 10 diopters) and age at the time of surgery (before or after the age of seven; p = 0. 002). In the multivariate model, the association between age at time of surgery and motor outcome was even stronger. The number of re-operations in the group operated before the age of 7 years was significantly less than in the group operated after the age of seven (2 versus 12, p = 0. 023). CONCLUSION: The postoperative alignment and sensory functions for patients with primary exotropia <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a surgical intervention before the age of seven years were, in this study, better than those in patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> surgery after the age of seven years...|$|R
