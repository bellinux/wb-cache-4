A dialogue spoken by Vadivelu in the film, [...] "Ka Ka Ka Po", which expands into Karuththukkalai Katchithamaaga Kavvikkondir Pongal (English: You have understood <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying),</b> became a very popular meme used on social networking sites.

[...] "Ka Ka Ka Po" [...] also served as an acronym for director Nalan Kumarasamy's romantic comedy Kadhalum Kadandhu Pogum (2016).|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{has said}} he {{believes}} in the jazz improvisational technique of never performing a song the same way twice and except for the unique rendition of the Astral Weeks songs live, doesn't perform a concert from a preconceived set list. Morrison {{has said he}} prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics. His ban against alcoholic beverages, which made entertainment news during 2008, {{was an attempt to}} prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances. In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: [...] "I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere. If anything, I aim to take myself there in my music. If the listener catches the wavelength of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> or singing, or gets whatever point whatever line means to them, then I guess as a writer I may have done a day's work." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Criminal" [...] {{was written}} in 2008 by Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, and was {{produced}} by Martin and Shellback. Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears spoke about Martin's productions on Femme Fatale, saying, [...] "Max played a huge role on this album {{and he has been}} there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> when I tell him what I want and don’t want musically". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "In Love With a Criminal". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as [...] "one of [...] favorites".|$|E

2500|$|Dennett self-identifies {{with a few}} terms: [...] " [...] {{note that}} my 'avoidance of the {{standard}} philosophical terminology for discussing such matters' often creates problems for me; philosophers {{have a hard time}} figuring out <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors." ...|$|E

"A {{people that}} {{suffered}} for 2,000 years, {{that went through}} the Holocaust, arrives at its patrimony but is thrust into a renewed round of bloodshed, that is perhaps the road to annihilation. In terms of cosmic justice, that's terrible. It's far more shocking than what happened in 1948 to {{a small part of}} the Arab nation that was then in Palestine...We are the greater victims in the course of history and we are also the greater potential victim. Even though we are oppressing the Palestinians, we are the weaker side here. We are a small minority in a large sea of hostile Arabs who want to eliminate us. So it's possible than [...] when their desire is realized, everyone will understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> to you now. Everyone will understand we are the true victims. But by then it will be too late." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the 2005 SPM results in March 2006, the Education Ministry {{announced}} it was considering reforming the SPM system due to what was perceived as over-emphasis on As. Local educators appeared responsive to the suggestion, with one professor at the University of Malaya deploring university students who could not write letters, debate, or understand footnoting. He complained that [...] "They don't understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying.</b> ... I cannot communicate with them." [...] He claimed that [...] "Before 1957 (the year of independence), school heroes were not those with 8As or 9As, they were the great debaters, those good in drama, in sport, and those leading the Scouts and Girl Guides." [...] A former Education Director-General, Murad Mohd Noor, agreed, saying that [...] "The rat race now begins at Standard 6 with the UPSR, with the competition resulting in parents forcing their children to attend private tuition." [...] He also expressed dismay at the prevalence of students taking 15 or 16 subjects for the SPM, calling it [...] "unnecessary".|$|E

2500|$|... "Many of the {{immigrants}} focused on the conspiracy theory. Some said that Hasan did not commit the crime, {{but that it was}} committed by other US military personnel who then killed him and said that {{he was the one who}} did it. They are like those who said that the September 11 attacks were not committed by those who committed them, and that it too was a “conspiracy.” I am one of those whose ancestors came here hundreds of years ago. I am a black American, and I know that “denial” is the explanation of those who cannot explain what they see or hear, especially if they belong to a minority group and are not used to the US way of life. But we black Americans have passed these stages. We became involved in political action, and the President of the United States is now one of us. Perhaps I am saying <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying</b> because I was a Christian, and became Muslim. But I believe that this issue is a temporary one, and we ask God to raise us from one stage to another." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, by my word; not in {{the spirit}} of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>saying.</b> How shall I act upon my heart, if I do not do it through the blood and the flesh?" ...|$|E
