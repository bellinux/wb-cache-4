5|$|Maddux {{made the}} most putouts in a season (39) three times in his career (1990, 1991, and 1993). The American League leader is Frank Lary, who made 32 putouts for the Detroit Tigers in 1961. Kaat is the leader in assists; he made 72 with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. The National League leader, Maddux, trails him by one (71 assists in 1996). Many {{pitchers}} have posted errorless seasons and 1.000 fielding percentages in their winning seasons; Mussina is the leader with four perfect seasons in the field. Guidry (19821984) and Mussina (19961998) both accomplished the feat in three consecutive seasons. The most double plays turned by a winning pitcher is nine, accomplished by Maddux in 2006. Four pitchers have also thrown no wild pitches in a winning season: Maddux (1997, 2006), Kaat (1975), Shantz (1961, 1962), and Rogers (2005). In contrast, the most wild pitches in a <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> is 18, by the knuckleballing Niekro. The fewest balks in a <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> is zero, achieved many times, but Maddux accomplished the feat the most time in his wins (12 balk-free seasons in 18 years). The most balks in a <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> is five, by Mike Norris in 1981 and Orel Hershiser in 1988. Langston picked off the most runners from the pitcher's mound in a <b>winning</b> <b>season,</b> with 10 in 1993; four pitchers are tied for the National League lead with 5 pickoffs. Rogers posted both the highest (100% in 2002) and lowest (0% in 2005) caught stealing percentage in a <b>winning</b> <b>season.</b> Shantz' 1961 season tied Rogers' 0% mark for lowest percentage caught, and three pitchers are tied for the National League lead (67% caught).|$|E

50|$|Before 1982, the Vandals had posted {{only four}} <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> in over four decades, {{and had not}} had {{consecutive}} <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> since 1938. Idaho had three consecutive <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> only once (1903-05), and never had four. With Erickson's arrival as head coach, the program embarked on 15 consecutive <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> (1982-96), and 11 trips to the Division I-AA playoffs in 14 seasons.|$|R
50|$|In the 2010-11 season, Jacobson led the Panthers {{to their}} eighth {{consecutive}} 18-plus <b>win</b> <b>season,</b> third straight postseason bid and a Valley-leading third straight 20-plus <b>win</b> <b>season.</b>|$|R
5|$|Connecticut's win {{gave the}} team a final record of 8–5 and {{back-to-back}} winning seasons {{for the first}} time since 2003–04. Buffalo's final record fell to 8–6, which still marked the first <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> for the Bulls since transitioning to Division I-A football in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 the {{university}} hired Jean Balthaser, who had coached at the University of Pittsburgh. Ms. Balthaser continued {{to expand the}} program, leading UConn to its first <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> in her first year as coach, and finishing with a 52-88 record over five seasons.|$|E
5|$|Ron Vanderlinden {{was hired}} as head coach for the 1997 season under a five-year contract. Vanderlinden had helped {{engineer}} turnarounds at Northwestern as defensive coordinator and at Colorado as a defensive assistant. The 1995 Northwestern team in particular had shocked observers when it recorded a 10–2 season and the Big Ten championship. In 1999, Maryland showed signs of significant improvement, and a <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> appeared certain when Maryland possessed a 5–2 record. The Terrapins, however, then suffered a three-game losing streak. In their finale against Virginia, the Terrapins needed a win to garner a likely invitation to either the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl—a Maryland alumnus was {{the chief executive officer}} of both events. The Terrapins came from behind and held the lead, 30–27, with 5:18 left to play. They regained possession with 1:40 remaining, but an inexperienced quarterback unintentionally stopped the clock by going out of bounds. After the ensuing punt, Virginia mounted a touchdown drive to win the game and end Maryland's bowl hopes. Despite narrowly missing a <b>winning</b> <b>season,</b> Vanderlinden was granted a two-year contract extension. In 2000, Maryland again fell short of a <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> and bowl game. The Terrapins entered their season closer with a 5–5 record, and again fell, this time in a rout by 24th-ranked Georgia Tech. Vanderlinden was fired the following day.|$|E

50|$|The Citadel {{has posted}} four 40 <b>win</b> <b>seasons</b> and twenty-six 30 <b>win</b> <b>seasons.</b> The Bulldogs {{are one of}} the leading {{programs}} in the Southern Conference, trailing only Western Carolina in total championships by one, with all other programs several behind the two leaders.|$|R
50|$|The Atlanta Falcons {{accomplished}} {{their first}} {{back to back}} <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> in franchise history. They still hold the record among all major American sports leagues for the longest streak of <b>seasons</b> without consecutive <b>winning</b> <b>seasons.</b> The streak lasted for 43 years from 1966.|$|R
5|$|The 1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season was}} the team's {{fourth in the}} National Football League.

5|$|The tie gave Washington an 811 {{record for}} the 1923 season, the second best in school history up to that point. It {{remained}} behind the 1916 season, when the squad went 601. Navy's record went to 513, a slight improvement from the previous year, when the team went 52. It became Navy's eighth straight <b>winning</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

Two players who were not named to the All-Star team in their winning year—Jason Giambi and Ken Griffey, Jr.—were named to the All-Star team in their {{previous}} season. Several winners have won other awards in their <b>winning</b> <b>season.</b> Carlos Peña, Posey, Ellsbury, Griffey and Hill won the Silver Slugger Award along with the Comeback Award. Posey won the NL MVP in his comeback season. Lee won the Cy Young Award in his <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> and Lidge won both the Rolaids Relief Man and DHL Delivery Man Awards the same year. Rodney was also named Delivery Man in his comeback 2012 season. The most recent winners are Anthony Rendon from the NL and Rick Porcello from the AL.|$|E
5000|$|The 1937 and 1938 seasons were Idaho's only <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> in {{football}} between 1927 and 1963, when the Vandals went 5-4 {{as an independent}} under head coach Dee Andros (the tenth game on November 23 was canceled). The 1938 season was the highest winning percentage (.650) between 1927 and 1971. Consecutive <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> at Idaho were not achieved again until 1982-83 under Dennis Erickson in the Big Sky Conference in Division I-AA.

5|$|Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> {{would be}} {{followed}} by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith. After starting the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North, Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him {{for a majority of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|After his {{national}} championship-winning season in 1953, Jim Tatum received Coach of the Year honors from the AFCA and the FWAA. He was also named {{coach of the}} year by the Southern Conference in 1951 and the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953 and 1955. The Sporting News named Jerry Claiborne the nation's top coach in 1974, and in 1982, his successor, Bobby Ross, received that distinction from the Touchdown Club. For his first-year turnaround of a team that had one <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> in the previous decade, Ralph Friedgen received national Coach of the Year plaudits from at least eight organizations.|$|E
5|$|After {{just one}} <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> in 10 years under coaches Sandra Hamm (1974–75), Wanda Flora (1975–80) and Jean Balthaser (1980–85), UConn hired as their new head coach the Italian-born Geno Auriemma, {{who had served}} as {{assistant}} coach at Virginia, {{with the goal of}} revitalizing the program. Auriemma's training skills had an immediate impact and the team showed steady signs of progress: after going 12–15 in his first season in 1985–86, Auriemma led UConn to winning seasons in 1986–87 and 1987–88.|$|E
50|$|From 2003 until O'Shea's {{departure}} in 2008, Ohio {{would have}} five-straight <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> {{with at least}} 19 <b>wins</b> each <b>season.</b> O'Shea was 120-95 in eight seasons in charge.|$|R
50|$|Despite his 44-29 record, five {{straight}} <b>winning</b> <b>seasons,</b> and guiding {{the team to}} its first 10 <b>win</b> <b>season</b> in over 30 years, Cutcliffe was fired by Ole Miss's Athletic Director Pete Boone in December 2004 after the team posted a disappointing 4-7 record and three consecutive losses to LSU.|$|R
5000|$|The Spartan {{football}} program posted just six <b>winning</b> <b>seasons</b> in the 1950s and '60s, but would later enter a [...] "golden age" [...] beginning in 1973, when the Spartans posted 15 <b>winning</b> <b>seasons,</b> appeared in four bowl games and sent nearly 50 players to the NFL over a 20-year stretch.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} to deliver a <b>winning</b> <b>season,</b> Vanderlinden did oversee {{substantive}} improvement in the program. In 1998, the Terrapins {{were one of the}} most improved teams in defense, scoring defense, passing defense, and rushing. In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997. In that same period, Maryland also improved from last to first in the conference in rushing, {{due in large part to}} Heisman Trophy candidate and school career rushing leader LaMont Jordan. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team's later success.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Ralph Friedgen {{took over}} a Maryland team that had one <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> in the past decade, and led them to an ACC {{championship}} and a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game in his first season. In the following two years, Friedgen became the only ACC head coach to have led his team to win ten games {{in each of his}} first three seasons. In his ten-year tenure, Friedgen led the Terrapins to seven bowl appearances. Most recently, Maryland concluded the 2010 season with a 9-4 record, a win in the Military Bowl, and a top 25 national ranking.|$|E
5|$|The California Golden Bears {{earned a}} 7–5 record in 2002, {{a year that}} culminated with a 30–7 victory over {{traditional}} rival Stanford in the Big Game. It was California's first <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> since 1993, and came {{on the heels of}} a 1–10 season in 2001. New head coach Jeff Tedford was praised for turning the program around so quickly, and expectations were high heading into the 2003 season. Tedford was awarded a new five-year contract in the offseason, and in the annual preseason poll of media covering the Pac-10 conference, Cal was picked to finish eighth in the 10-team organization.|$|E

5|$|The Flames {{played their}} 25th season in Calgary in 2005–06, {{finishing}} with 103 points. It was their best total since the 1989 Cup <b>winning</b> <b>season,</b> and {{good enough to}} capture their first division title in 12 years. However, the Flames lost to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games during {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Miikka Kiprusoff captured both the William M. Jennings and Vezina Trophies as the NHL's top goaltender, while Dion Phaneuf's 20 goals was the third-highest total for a rookie defenceman in league history.|$|E
5|$|With {{their loss}} to Auburn, Alabama {{completed}} the first winless season in Alabama football history, {{and since then}} they have had only two other winless seasons in 1895 and 1955. The losses of 1893 were attributed to the small stature of the Crimson players {{and not to the}} coaching and training of the team. As such, Abbott returned as head coach for the 1894 season and led Alabama to a <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> that included their first all-time win over Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Delaney was {{selected}} {{in the second round}} of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. United Press International named him Rookie of the Year of the American Football Conference for the 1981 NFL season after he rushed for 1,121 yards, set four club records, and averaged 80.9 yards a game. Delaney's effort helped propel the Chiefs to a 9–7 record, the team's first <b>winning</b> <b>season</b> since 1973. In his rookie season, he {{was selected}} to the Pro Bowl after setting Chiefs records for most yards in a season (1,121), most yards in a game (193 vs. Houston), most consecutive 100-yard-plus games (three) and most 100-yard games in a season (five).|$|E
