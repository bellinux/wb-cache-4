5|$|Outside of {{the urban}} area, the City of Skopje {{encompasses}} many small settlements. Some of them are becoming outer suburbs, such as Singeliḱ, located {{on the road to}} Belgrade, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> than 23,000 inhabitants, and Dračevo, which has almost 20,000 inhabitants. Other large settlements are located north of the city, such as Radišani, with 9,000 inhabitants, whereas smaller villages can be found on Mount Vodno or in Saraj municipality, which is the most rural of the ten municipalities that form the City of Skopje.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe. There are more than 20 subspecies, but the precise number depends on how small differences between populations are evaluated. This article follows the 2013 Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive treatment, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> recognised forms than the 1996 Tits, Nuthatches and Treecreepers. Given the similarities between geographical forms of the Eurasian nuthatch, subspecies boundaries are somewhat fluid, although fewer than half as many are recognised now as in 1967.|$|E

5|$|With its theatres, symphony orchestra, opera company, {{performance}} venues, {{and museums}} such as Aalborg Historical Museum and the Aalborg Museum of Modern Art, Aalborg {{is an important}} cultural hub. The Aalborg Carnival, held {{at the end of}} May, {{is one of the largest}} festivals in Scandinavia, attracting some 100,000 people annually. The major university is the University of Aalborg, founded in 1974, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> than 20,000 students (as of 2016). The University College of Northern Denmark is one of seven new regional organisations while the Royal School of Library and Information Science (RSLIS) provides higher education in library and information science. Trænregimentet, the Danish regiment for army supply and emergency medical personnel, is also in Aalborg. Aalborg University Hospital, the largest in the north of Jutland, was founded in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

25|$|The Wellington/Wairarapa {{wine-growing}} region {{is one of}} New Zealand's smallest, with several sub-regions, which include Gladstone, Martinborough, Masterton, and Opaki.

As a consequence, many of the vineyards established there are older than their counterparts {{in the rest of the}} Wairarapa. Subtle differences are seen in the wines from the South Wairarapa (which includes Martinborough), <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> maritime influences, to those grown further north.|$|E
