The scientists prefer a landing site with both morphologic and mineralogical evidence for past water. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple hydrated minerals such as clay minerals is preferred, but it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to a balance between engineering constraints and scientific goals.|$|E
25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the bidding}} process and {{leading up to}} the vote at the 117th IOC Session, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, {{particularly}} as its bid was the city's third in recent history (previous bids being for 1992 and 2008). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of Sebastian Coe as the head of London 2012, on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris. In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest. On 1 July 2005, IOC president Jacques Rogge, when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press, [...] "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1947 Marx {{was asked}} to host a radio quiz program You Bet Your Life. It was {{broadcast}} by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950 and ran for eleven years. Filmed before a live audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases [...] "Say the secret word and the duck <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> and give you fifty dollars," [...] "Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?" [...] and [...] "What color is the White House?" [...] (asked to reward a losing contestant a consolation prize).|$|E

2500|$|On 6 June 2005, the IOC {{released}} its evaluation reports {{for the five}} candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations. On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, [...] "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me {{that it will be}} very close.

2500|$|In January 2009, on a {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson {{stated that he}} is [...] "adamantly opposed" [...] to the division of Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. He also stated that Armageddon is [...] "not going to be fought at Megiddo" [...] but will be the [...] "battle of Jerusalem," [...] when [...] "the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews. Jews {{are not going to}} give up Jerusalem—they shouldn't—and the rest of the world is going to insist they give it up." [...] Robertson added that Jerusalem is a [...] "spiritual symbol that must not be given away" [...] because [...] "Jesus Christ the Messiah <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to the part of Jerusalem that the Arabs want," [...] and that's [...] "not good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mellon became unpopular {{with the}} onset of the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover, in memoirs {{published}} decades later, wrote that Mellon advised him as President to [...] "liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate... it will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>down.</b> People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people." [...] Hoover claimed credit for disregarding this advice and intervening in the market, though with little success. There is no corroboration that Mellon ever said such a thing, however, and the claim that he did is inconsistent with his published speeches, which supported anti-recessionary measures by the Federal Reserve. As Treasury Secretary, Mellon was an ex-officio member of the Federal Reserve Board. There, he successfully urged the Fed to cut its discount rate after the stock market crash in October 1929, and supported subsequent rate cuts, although only a third of the commercial banks were a part of the Federal Reserve and could benefit from the rate cuts. In November 1929, he recommended a cut of 1 percentage point in personal and corporate income tax rates. He supported Hoover's proposal to increase federal construction spending as an antirecession measure.|$|E
