Referancing to the {{connection}} characteristic and mechanical behavior {{as well as}} the defects in application of joints on concrete-filled steel tube between columns and beams, a new connection type of steel beam throughout joints model is proposed. The inner force transfer mechanism and stress distribution situation of the joint under the monotonous load and hysteretic behavior, ductility, energy dissipation under cyclically lateral load are analyzed using the software ANSYS. The result indicated that the stress of steel pipe is reduced effectively when continious <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> <b>joint</b> is used. Meanwhile， the rigidity of the joint is enhancedand.

To examine the imperfection effect on the shear buckling resistance of a <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> with sectional damage, a series of nonlinear finite element (FE) analyses were carried out for a <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> with sectional damage, which was assumed as local corrosion damage.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{steel plate}} shear wall (SPSW) is a {{building}} lateral force resisting system that comprises a moment frame (the boundary frame) and slender steel diaphragms (<b>web</b> <b>plates)</b> welded or bolted inside the boundary frame. The system resists lateral load primarily through tension field {{action in the}} <b>web</b> <b>plates.</b> <b>Web</b> <b>plate</b> forces are anchored by the boundary frame members. The Seismic Provisions currently require the boundary members to be capacity designed assuming the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> has fully yielded in tension and forms a pure tension field at a prescribed angle computed from an elastic analysis. In design, <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> are frequently modeled {{as a series of}} parallel, inclined tension-only truss elements. This research focused on the development and magnitude of in-plane <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> stresses due to seismic demands and how these are transferred to and resisted by the boundary frame, specifically the vertical boundary members, or elements (VBEs). The evolution of <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> stress is controlled by the material properties, slenderness ratio, hardening behavior, <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> aspect ratio and cyclic drift history. Several small-scale cyclic tests of steel <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> were conducted to investigate the hardening, pinching and snap-though behavior, and to validate observations made in numerical studies that the tension field inclination angle migrates to a fixed value close to 45 degrees as the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> is loaded plastically. Using statistical methods, the magnitude of hardening expected for typical <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> materials was then estimated for the MCE level earthquake. The results of the experiments and ABAQUS analyses of single story SPSWs are used to develop and implement a new OpenSees uniaxial material model, SPSW-WP, to be applied to truss elements, specifically for SPSW applications. The material was designed to mimic the effects of in-plane web buckling and accurately capture the effects of material hardening, stiffness degradation, residual shear strength, <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> slenderness and correctly model the reloading drift under cyclic loading conditions. The model is calibrated using ABAQUS analyses of single story SPSWs with a range of material hardening characteristics and geometries. It is then validated using both ABAQUS models and with cyclic test data. Finally the new material model is incorporated into the analyses of two six-story SPSWs; one utilizing slender A 36 steel <b>web</b> <b>plates,</b> and one with stocky, low yield point LYP 100 steel <b>web</b> <b>plates.</b> The story drift demands and VBE demands are compared and contrasted with ABAQUS analyses of the equivalent structures for four DBE and four MCE level ground motions. <b>Web</b> <b>plate</b> hardening and changes in the tension field inclination angle were found to be significant but had only a moderate influence on VBE demands. The use of stocky <b>web</b> LYP <b>plates</b> enhances lateral stiffness, reduces story drifts and reduces VBE demands when compared with more commonly used slender A 36 <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> of lower net tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{self-centering}} {{steel plate}} shear wall (SC-SPSW) is a lateral force-resisting {{system that is}} capable of providing enhanced seismic performance, including recentering after an earthquake. The primary lateral strength of the SC-SPSW is provided by thin steel infill plates, referred to as <b>web</b> <b>plates,</b> that are connected to the beams and columns. During lateral sway, the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> resists lateral load through the development of tension field action, and energy is dissipated through ductile yielding of the plate. Unlike conventional steel plate shear walls, the boundary frame in the SC-SPSW employs post-tensioned (PT) beam-to-column connections that are allowed to rock open during lateral sway. If properly designed, the PT connections eliminate damage in the boundary frame and provide restoring forces necessary to recentering the building during an earthquake, thus reducing post-earthquake downtime and repair costs. This research builds upon previous analytical and numerical proof-of-concept studies on SC-SPSWs. Experimental testing was conducted to better understand SC-SPSW behavior and seismic performance. The experimental program consisted of (1) a series of large-scale subassembly cyclic tests to evaluate the impact of various design parameters on SC-SPSW behavior and component demands and (2) full-scale two-story pseudo-dynamic tests to evaluate system performance at three different seismic hazard levels. These tests also investigated possible performance-enhancing variations in SC-SPSW design that were not considered in the previous proof-of-concept study. Post-tensioned column base connections were proposed to eliminate damage in the columns and provide additional recentering. SC-SPSWs with <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> that are only connected to the beams were proposed as a means of mitigating <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> tearing and reducing column demands. Methods for designing PT column base connections and SC-SPSWs with <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> connected to the beams only are presented. Numerical investigations were conducted to evaluate different methods of modeling <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> behavior in SC-SPSWs, ranging from the relatively simple tension-only strip model to the more complex shell element model. When used in cyclic or dynamic analyses, the tension-only strip model was found to significantly underestimate the energy dissipation provided by the <b>web</b> <b>plate,</b> while the shell element model was too computationally demanding for wide-spread implementation. Based on numerical and experimental observations, a modified tension-compression strip model was proposed to conservatively approximate the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> unloading resistance and the additional energy dissipation it provides. Nonlinear response history analyses were conducted to asses seismic performance of several three- and nine-story SC-SPSW designs. These analyses compared SC-SPSWs with <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> connected to the beams and columns (fully-connected) and SC-SPSWs with <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> connected to the beams only (beam-connected). Results showed that SC-SPSWs using beam-connected <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> had smaller boundary frame members and larger drift demands than their fully-connected <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> counterparts; however, they were still able to meet proposed performance objectives. The numerical simulations also investigated the effects of considering the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> unloading resistance in the model (e. g. the traditional tension-only model vs. the modified tension-compression model). These analyses showed that considering even small amounts of compression in the strip model significantly reduced drift demands...|$|R

Although several methods have been {{proposed}} to predict the behavior of SPW, but lack of a comprehensive method containing a complete design procedure, have always confused the designers.

The parameters varied were the panel aspect ratios and the shapes and sizes of centrally placed holes in them.

The modelling used allowed the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> to assume its natural boundary conditions.

50|$|In {{the past}} two decades the steel plate shear wall (SPSW), also known as the steel plate wall (SPW), has been used in a number of {{buildings}} in Japan and North America as part of the lateral force resisting system. In earlier days, SPSWs were treated like vertically oriented plate girders and design procedures tended to be very conservative. Web buckling was prevented through extensive stiffening or by selecting an appropriately thick <b>web</b> <b>plate,</b> until more information became available on the post-buckling characteristics of <b>web</b> <b>plates.</b> Although the plate girder theory seems appropriate for the design of an SPW structure, a very important difference is the relatively high bending strength and stiffness of the beams and columns that form the boundary elements of the wall. These members are expected to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall behaviour of a building incorporating this type of system and several researchers have focused on this aspect of SPWs. The energy dissipating qualities of the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> under extreme cyclic loading has raised the prospect of using SPSWs as a promising alternative to conventional systems in high-risk seismic regions. A further benefit is that the diagonal tension field of the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> acts like a diagonal brace in a braced frame and thus completes the truss action, which is known to be an efficient means to control wind drift.|$|R
