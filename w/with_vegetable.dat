The nests are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E
5|$|In May 1910 Gaudí paid a {{short visit}} to Vic, {{where he was}} tasked to design the {{lampposts}} for the city's Plaça Major, in commemoration of the first centenary {{of the birth of}} Jaume Balmes. They were obelisk-shaped lamps, with basalt rock bases from Castellfollit de la Roca and wrought iron arms, topped with the four-armed cross; they were decorated <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> themes and included the birth and death dates of Balmes. They were demolished in 1924 due to poor maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform jacket was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed jacket, looking much like a pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with collar and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} embargoed until 1 st March 2018. Vegetables are {{commonly}} rejected by children, making {{it is important}} to consider factors which are associated with children’s fussiness <b>with</b> <b>vegetables.</b> The current study aimed to investigate whether fussiness <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> is associated <b>with</b> a number of factors including: caregiver and child vegetable consumption; caregivers’ general feeding practices; and caregivers’ vegetable-specific feeding practices. Caregivers (N= 297) of preschool children completed questionnaire measures of their child’s fussiness <b>with</b> <b>vegetables,</b> as well as several caregiver and child factors hypothesised to be associated with children’s fussiness <b>with</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Findings indicate that children who are fussier <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> consume a smaller quantity of vegetables and almost all have caregivers who eat a smaller quantity of <b>vegetables.</b> Children’s fussiness <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> was not significantly related to any general feeding practices used by caregivers. However, children’s fussiness <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> was significantly associated with the use of several vegetable specific feeding practices. Caregivers of fussier children used more encouragement/pressure to eat <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> (r= 0. 14, p= 0. 01), hid vegetables within other foods more often (r= 0. 30, p=< 0. 01), used more food rewards for vegetable consumption (r= 0. 19, p< 0. 01), more other rewards for vegetable consumption (r= 0. 21, p< 0. 01) and compromised more when feeding vegetables (r= 0. 14, p= 0. 01). These findings suggest that rather than caregivers’ general feeding practices being related to children’s fussiness <b>with</b> <b>vegetables,</b> the specific feeding practices used when vegetables are rejected are more significant. It may therefore be helpful to develop advice for caregivers about which feeding practices to avoid when faced with a child who is fussy about eating vegetables...|$|R

5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E
5|$|Kalighat {{painting}} {{originated in}} 19th century Kolkata {{as a local}} style that reflected a variety of themes including mythology and quotidian life. The Government College of Art and Craft, founded in 1864, has been the cradle as well as workplace of eminent artists including Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, and Nandalal Bose. The art college was {{the birthplace of the}} Bengal school of art that arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the prevalent academic art styles in the early 20th century. The Academy of Fine Arts and other art galleries hold regular art exhibitions. The city is recognised for its appreciation of Rabindra sangeet (songs written by Rabindranath Tagore) and Indian classical music, with important concerts and recitals, such as Dover Lane Music Conference, being held throughout the year; Bengali popular music, including baul folk ballads, kirtans, and Gajan festival music; and modern music, including Bengali-language adhunik songs. Since the early 1990s, new genres have emerged, including one comprising alternative folk–rock Bengali bands. Another new style, jibonmukhi gaan ("songs about life"), is based on realism. Key elements of Kolkata's cuisine include rice and a fish curry known as machher jhol, which can be accompanied by desserts such as roshogolla, sandesh, and a sweet yoghurt known as mishti dohi. Bengal's large repertoire of seafood dishes includes various preparations of ilish, a fish that is a favourite among Calcuttans. Street foods such as beguni (fried battered eggplant slices), kati roll (flatbread roll <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> or chicken, mutton, or egg stuffing), phuchka (a deep-fried crêpe with tamarind sauce) and Indian Chinese cuisine from Chinatown are popular.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the cathedral has a nave with two aisles, a small transept, and an eastern apse with three chapels. The nave is covered by barrel vaulting and the lateral aisles by groin vaults. The nave has an upper storey, a spacious triforium (arched gallery), that could accommodate more mass attendants in the tribunes if needed. All columns of the interior have decorated capitals, mainly <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> motifs, but also with animals and geometric patterns. The windows of the lantern-tower and the big window in the west facade are the main sources of natural light of the cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is the {{restoration}} of the book cover; This can be as complicated as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new full leather binding <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> tanned leather, dyed with natural dyes, and hand-marbled papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.|$|E

25|$|Timber is {{the prime}} {{structural}} material abundantly available in many varieties in Kerala. Perhaps the skilful choice of timber, accurate joinery, artful assembly and delicate carving of wood work for columns, walls and roofs frames are the unique characteristics of Malayali architecture. From {{the limitations of the}} materials, a mixed mode of construction was evolved in Malayali architecture. The stone work was restricted to the plinth even in important buildings such as temples. Laterite was used for walls. The roof structure in timber was covered with palm leaf thatching for most buildings and rarely with tiles for palaces or temples. The Kerala murals are paintings <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> dyes on wet walls in subdued shades of brown. The indigenous adoption of the available raw materials and their transformation as enduring media for architectural expression thus became the dominant feature of the Malayali style of architecture.|$|E
