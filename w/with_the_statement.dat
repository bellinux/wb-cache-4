According to a 2015 Gallup poll of U.S. adults, the perception of chiropractors is generally favourable; two-thirds of American adults agree that chiropractors have their patient's best interest in mind {{and more than half}} also agree that most chiropractors are trustworthy. Less than 10% of US adults disagreed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> that chiropractors were trustworthy.|$|E

25|$|The later geonim did not {{restrict}} {{themselves to}} the Mishnah and Talmud, but used the decisions and responsa of their predecessors, whose sayings and traditions were generally regarded as authoritative. These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size. The letters of the Geonim, which, for the most part, contained replies to many problems, assumed a definite and official form. They began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> that the questions had been correctly received, read, and considered, and that the corresponding answers had been given {{in the presence of}} the gaon and with his approval.|$|E

25|$|Support for reunification {{among the}} younger generations in South Korea {{has been seen}} by some as faltering, with the percent of people in {{government}} polls who regarded reunification as essential dropping from more than eighty percent in the 1990s to fifty-six percent. Among Koreans in their twenties, forty-one percent agreed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> (and only about twenty percent of teenagers). Many suspect that younger generations, not sharing previous generations' perception of Korea's unnatural division, {{are more concerned with}} South Korea's economic development and hesitant to singlehandedly take on North Korean integration and the associated costs (which some estimates put as high as $1 trillion).|$|E
25|$|The {{increasingly}} {{rapid rate}} of historical retelling that occurs {{near the end}} of the work raises the question of whether the work was completed. Some manuscripts include in their prologues an introduction of the text as running ‘from a to z’, and others end book fourteen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement,</b> “Here begins the fifteenth book, lacking P”. However, book thirteen includes a line about ending the series with a history of the Roman emperors. It is possible that the last books have been lost over time, though it is also likely that Fulgentius simply lost interest in the work and gave it a hurried anticlimactic finish, as he did with other works such as the Content of Virgil.|$|E
