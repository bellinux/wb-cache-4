5|$|After {{initializing}} {{the concept}} in January 2013, the two discussed {{the project for}} three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story. The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> rewrite it.|$|E

5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel to the Star Trek universe, and so the two <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> visualize the film from start to finish. After Shatner explained the entire story in a day-long session, Rodis went home and sketched out each scene from the script.

5|$|The devotion that Beatrice showed to {{her mother}} was {{acknowledged}} in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger. The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at Balmoral. Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company; indeed, they had <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> carry out the Queen's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E

The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> deal with problems that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government.

5|$|The Nokota {{horse is}} a feral and semi-feral horse breed {{located in the}} {{badlands}} of southwestern North Dakota in the United States. The breed developed in the 19th century from foundation bloodstock consisting of ranch-bred horses produced from the horses of local Native Americans mixed with Spanish horses, Thoroughbreds, harness horses and related breeds. The Nokota was almost wiped out during the early 20th century when ranchers, in cooperation with state and federal agencies, <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> reduce competition for livestock grazing. However, when Theodore Roosevelt National Park {{was created in the}} 1940s, a few bands were inadvertently trapped inside, and thus were preserved.|$|E
5|$|The Pokémon {{franchise}} {{revolves around}} 805fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs and skills. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World.

Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, {{only a handful of}} artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon, however, by 2013 a team of 20artists <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E
