25|$|A battery's {{characteristics}} {{may vary}} over load cycle, over charge cycle, and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry, current drain, and temperature. At low temperatures, a battery cannot deliver as much power.

50|$|The Volvo C30 Electric is {{equipped}} with three climate systems: one supplies the passengers with heating or cooling; one cools or <b>warms</b> the <b>battery</b> pack as necessary; and the electric motor and power electronics are water-cooled. The climate control in the passenger cabin features a bioethanol-powered heater, a solution chosen by Volvo to get heating without compromising the battery driving range, but the driver has the option to run the climate unit on electricity from the batteries. Ethanol is the default mode and the ethanol tank can carry 14.5 L of bio-ethanol. Volvo has Tested the C30 in winter conditions in temperatures as low as −20 °C (−4 °F).|$|R
5000|$|The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid car {{features}} an Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery (EGHR) system to accelerate coolant heat up time. This gives faster heat {{up of the}} engine coolant which in turn heats up the engine faster. Less choke is used giving reduced emissions and fuel consumption. This will also quicken cabin heating warm up for passenger comfort and window defrosting. For hybrid applications it also can <b>warm</b> the <b>battery</b> pack. The cooling system is connected to a heat exchanger placed in the exhaust gas transferring the thermal energy from the exhaust gas to the cooling system. When the engine is warmed up the exhaust gas is diverted to a by-pass pipe. http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/04/2016-chevrolet-malibu-hybrid-exhaust-gas-heat-recovery-feature-spotlight/ ...|$|R
50|$|The {{advanced}} {{battery system}} uses an active liquid cooling and heating thermal management system to precondition and regulate {{the temperature in}} the battery system. This feature helps to maximize battery life and driving range. The active liquid system heats or chills a coolant before pumping it through the battery cooling system. This loop regulates temperature throughout the system against external conditions. On a hot day the cooled liquid absorbs heat from the battery pack, dispersing it through a radiator before pumping it through the chiller again. On a cold day the heated liquid <b>warms</b> the <b>batteries,</b> gradually bringing the system’s temperature to a level that allows it to efficiently accept charge energy and provide enough discharge power for expected vehicle performance.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the process and}} the results of the thermal {{analysis}} applied to a nanosatellite developed at Politecnico di Torino. First, main mission parameters and the spacecraft design are presented, in order to fix the boundary conditions and the thermal environment used for the analysis. Then, the thermal model built to solve the thermal balance problem is described into details, and the numerical simulation code is presented. Finally, results are given and discussed in depth. The tool developed provides excellent modelling capabilities and temperature distributions have been validated through commercial software. The analysis has been used to refine the spacecraft configuration and to set the requirements applicable to the thermal control system of the satellite. The results showed that a basically passive control is sufficient to maintain most spacecraft's components within their temperature range when appropriate thermal coatings and/or tapes are provided.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) battery’s {{efficiency}} increasing {{is one of}} {{the central}} purposes of PV industry. It is possible to increase solar panel’s production of electricity by improving characteristics of solar panel glazing. Crystal anti-reflective thin film coating on glass was designed specifically for monocrystalline and multicrystalline silicon wafer modules. Developed glazing takes into consideration: silicon crystalline cell light wavelength sensitivity; temperature conditions and need to reject heat in the spectrum that cells do not use for energy production (near infrared radiation); the Sun's position over solar panel during the day and the year (angle of light beam incidence). Efficiency of regular and modified glazing of PV batteries was investigated in real weather conditions in solar energy testing polygon. It was determined that PV batteries glazing types have different impact on PV batteries production in similar environment conditions. Efficiency increasing was in high solar radiation intensity conditions for modified glazing of PV batteries, because this glazing reduced PV <b>batteries</b> <b>warming</b> from infrared radiation. But difference of energy production was lower in cloudy days, especially when PV module’s temperature was low. Annual energy production of modified glazed PV batteries in comparison with regular glazed PV batteries is about 2 % higher...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{energy storage}} {{is one of}} most {{important}} technologies for a sustainable future of our society in times of energy crisis and global <b>warming.</b> Lithium ion <b>batteries</b> and electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) with their high energy and power density, portability and promising cycling life are {{the core of this}} future technology. This review gives some aspects of materials science on nanostructured carbon materials for these applications. Nanostructuring (decreasing of dimension) and nanoarchitecturing (combining or assembling of several nanobuilding blocks) of carbon and carbon-containing composites are the landmark in the development of electrodes for higher performance with long cycle life and higher safety. Increasing ion transport without sacrificing the electron transport {{is believed to be the}} paradise solution. Numerous works reviewed in this paper show higher performance of such electrodes, but give mostly diverse values showing no convergence tendency for future development. The lack on knowledge of interface processes and defect dynamics of electrodes, as well as the missing cooperation between material scientists, electrochemists and battery engineers are the apparent reasons for the currently widespread trial and error strategy of experiments. A concerted action between all these disciplines is the prerequisite for the future development of electrochemical energy storage devices...|$|R

40|$|Diesel {{generators}} and lead-acid batteries are currently used as telecom site back-up power {{in areas where}} the local electricity grid is not always available. Fuel cell systems are an interesting alternative. In this study, environmental and economic aspects of the following five power back-up systems have been investigated: a diesel generator system, a lead-acid battery system, a fuel cell system with H 2 from steel bottles (produced from central electrolysis), a fuel cell system with on-site electrolysis, and a fuel cell system with on-site reforming of methanol. Calculations have been performed for different combinations of power demands (1. 5 kW, 3 kW, 5 kW, 8 kW) and electricity grid availabilities (99. 9 %, 99 %, 95 %, 90 %, 75 %). The fuel/electricity use {{is an important factor in}} the environmental investigation. Based on the four chosen impact categories (abiotic depletion potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and global <b>warming</b> potential), the <b>battery</b> system and the fuel cell system with a reformer have lower potential environmental impact than the diesel system. The two fuel cell systems with H 2 from electrolysis could have better environmental performance than the diesel system if the electricity is based on a significant share of renewable energy. However, it is important to remember that the choice of weighting factors has a significant impact on the ranking of the different power systems. The battery system is the cheapest for most of the combinations of power demand and grid availability, especially when there is no need for a change of batteries. Fuel cell systems with H 2 bottles or reformer can be a cost-competitive option for smaller power demands and grid availabilities down to 95 %, if the site conditions are inappropriate for battery systems and if the investment cost for the fuel cells is lowered. It is suggested that calculations should be performed for a variety of site locations, in order to eliminate some of the uncertainties in the estimates and to be able to identify sites were fuel cell systems can be used. A study capturing a bigger variety in battery configurations should also be executed...|$|R
