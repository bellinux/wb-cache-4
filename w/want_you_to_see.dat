25|$|The film's plot {{significantly}} parodies {{the films}} The Ring, Signs, The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, and 8 Mile. The film grossed $220.7 million worldwide. It {{is the last}} film in the series to be released by The Walt Disney Company's subsidiary Miramax Films, under the brand Dimension Films. After Dimension Films brand left Disney, Scary Movie 4 became the first film to be released by The Weinstein Company.

500|$|CMX {{came under}} {{a great deal}} of {{criticism}} for its edits from readers. These edits included the length and breadth of the book, censoring out anything they felt was questionable for a teen audience such as covering up or removing nudity, fanservice, and sexual innuendo as well as a removal of an omake chapter. This was done by a brand whose promotional material asserts that it offers [...] "pure manga [...] 100% the way the original Japanese creators <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it." [...] One of grievances made against CMX is that the edits are not only severe, but very noticeable. One review states it is [...] "possibly the most heavily censored title {{in the history of the}} North American manga industry." ...|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E

Catholic presses had been silenced and kindergartens closed and religious instruction in schools nearly stamped out: ...|$|E
2500|$|Moyers {{reported}} and Potter confirmed {{that there were}} attempts to radicalize Moore {{in an effort to}} discredit the film’s message. Moore would be referred to as a [...] "Hollywood entertainer" [...] or [...] "Hollywood moviemaker" [...] to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. [...] "They would <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That's part of the strategy." [...] Potter said that the strategy worked and the impact of the film was [...] "blunted" [...] by the public relations campaign. He agreed that Sicko contained [...] "a great truth" [...] which he said was [...] "that we shouldn't fear government involvement in our health care system. That there is an appropriate role for government, and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie. [...] You know, we have more people who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada. And that if you include the people who are underinsured, more people than in the United Kingdom. We have huge numbers of people who are also just a lay-off away from joining the ranks of the uninsured, or being purged by their insurance company, and winding up there." ...|$|E
