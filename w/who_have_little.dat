5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

25|$|As more {{transgender}} {{people are}} represented and included {{within the realm}} of mass culture, the stigma that is associated with being transgender can influence the decisions, ideas, and thoughts based upon it.

500|$|Although this hunter was sharing meat, he was {{not doing}} so in the {{framework}} of reciprocity. The general model of costly signalling is not reciprocal; rather, individuals who share acquire more mates and allies. Costly signalling applies to situations in Kalahari foraging groups where giving often goes to recipients <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> to offer in return. A young hunter is motivated to impress community members with daughters so that he can obtain his first wife. Older hunters may wish to attract women interested in an extramarital relationship, or to be a [...] In these northern Kalahari groups, the killing of a large animal indicates a man who has mastered the art of hunting and can support a family. Generally, many women seek a man who is a good hunter, has an agreeable character, is generous, and has advantageous social ties. Since hunting ability is a prerequisite for marriage, men who are good hunters enter the marriage market earliest. Costly signalling theory explains seemingly wasteful foraging displays.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have argued}} that Hume's {{position}} assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many {{have argued that}} miracles not only do not contradict {{the laws of nature}}, but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that [...] "there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted". They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.|$|E
2500|$|Liang {{argues that}} the concept of [...] "author" [...] is tied to the notion of {{copyright}} and emerged to define a new social relationship— the way society perceives the ownership of knowledge. The concept of [...] "author" [...] thus naturalised a particular process of knowledge production where the emphasis on individual contribution and individual ownership takes precedence over the concept of [...] "community knowledge". Relying on the concept of the author, copyright {{is based on the assumption}} that without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive. Liang challenges this logic, arguing that [...] "many authors <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> hope of ever finding a market for their publications, and whose copyright is, as a result, virtually worthless, have in the past, and even in the present, continued to write." [...] Liang points out that people produce works purely for personal satisfaction, or even for respect and recognition from peers. Liang {{argues that the}} 19th Century saw the prolific authorship of literary works in the absence of meaningful copyright that benefited the author. In fact, Liang argues, copyright protection usually benefited the publisher, and rarely the author.|$|E
