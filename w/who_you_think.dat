500|$|Lucas North is a main {{character}} in the seventh, eighth, and ninth series; the ninth series reveals that Lucas [...] "isn't <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he is." [...] Following {{the creation of the}} character by the show's writers, Armitage was chosen early in the casting process, since the producers believed he could carry the mystery of the character. A tentative viewer of Spooks, he was approached for the role following the completion of the second series of Robin Hood, in which he portrayed series regular Sir Guy of Gisbourne. After agreeing to appear in Spooks, Armitage learned how to speak fluent Russian and lost a stone in weight in order to fit the description of his character.|$|E
500|$|Following Ros's {{death in}} the series eight finale, Lucas [...] "sees the team's been {{slightly}} shattered by it" [...] and responds by [...] "trying to pull the team together and aiming {{to be a strong}} figure for Harry." [...] The ninth series reveals a dark secret in Lucas's past that will lead to the [...] "ultimate betrayal." [...] Armitage revealed that Lucas [...] "isn't quite <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he is." [...] It sees the introduction of a character named Maya, played by Laila Rouass, who is Lucas's old flame and possible first love; she is involved in Lucas's secret. Lucas states that Maya means more to him than his job and reputation. Vaughn would use Maya as a way of controlling him. Armitage also revealed Lucas goes off the radar [...] "quite a lot this series" [...] and behaves [...] "quite strangely." ...|$|E

6000|$|... ...Beautiful must be your Cornish {{land and}} your Cornish sea, idyllic your Cornish setting, like this flattering, this {{wonderful}} summer, and ours here doubtless may claim but a modest place beside it all. Yet {{as you have}} with you your Mother and Sister, which I am delighted to hear and whom I gratefully bless, so I can match them with my nephew and niece (the former with me alas indeed but for these 10 or 12 days,) who are an extreme benediction to me. My niece, a charming and interesting young person and most conversable, stays, I hope, through {{the greater part of}} September, and I even curse that necessary limit--when she returns to America.... I like exceedingly to hear that your work has got so bravely on, and envy you that sovereign consciousness. When it's finished--well, when it's finished let some of those sweet young people, the bons amis (yours), come to me for the small change of remark that I gathered from you the other day (you were adorable about it) they have more than once chinked in your ear as from my poor old pocket, and they will see, you will, in what coin I shall have paid them. I too am working with a certain shrunken regularity--when not made to lapse and stumble by circumstances (damnably physical) beyond my control. These circumstances tend to come, on the whole (thanks to a great power of patience in my ancient organism,) rather more within my management than for a good while back; but to live with a bad and chronic anginal demon preying on one's vitals takes a great deal of doing. However, I didn't mean to write you of that side of the picture (save that it's a large part of that same,) and only glance that way to make sure of your tenderness even when I may seem to you backward and blank. It isn't to exploit your compassion--it's only to be able to feel that I am not without your fond understanding: so far as your blooming youth (there's the crack in the fiddle-case!) can fondly understand my so otherwise-conditioned age.... My desire is to stay on here as late into the autumn as may consort with my condition--I dream of sticking on through November even if possible: Cheyne Walk and the black-barged yellow river will be the more agreeable to me when I get back to them. I make out that you will then be in London again--I mean by November, though such a black gulf of time intervenes; and then of course I may look to you to come down to me for a couple of days. It will be the lowest kind of [...] "jinks"--so halting is my pace; yet we shall somehow make it serve. Don't say to me, by the way, à propos of jinks--the [...] "high" [...] kind that you speak of having so wallowed in previous to leaving town--that I ever challenge you as to why you wallow, or splash or plunge, or dizzily and sublimely soar (into the jinks element,) or whatever you may call it: as if I ever remarked on anything but the absolute inevitability of it for you at your age and with your natural curiosities, as it were, and passions. It's good healthy exercise, when it comes but in bouts and brief convulsions, and it's always a kind of thing that it's good, and considerably final, to have done. We must know, as much as possible, in our beautiful art, yours and mine, what we are talking about--and the only way to know is to have lived and loved and cursed and floundered and enjoyed and suffered. I think I don't regret a single [...] "excess" [...] of my responsive youth--I only regret, in my chilled age, certain occasions and possibilities I didn't embrace. Bad doctrine to impart to a young idiot or duffer, but in place for a young friend (pressed to my heart) with a fund of nobler passion, the preserving, the defying, the dedicating, and which always has the last word; the young friend who can dip and shake off and go his straight way again when it's time. But we'll talk of all this--it's absolutely late. Who is D. H. Lawrence, <b>who,</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> would interest me? Send him and his book along--by which I simply mean Inoculate me, at your convenience (don't address me the volume), so far as I can be inoculated. I always try to let anything of the kind [...] "take." [...] Last year, you remember, a couple of improbabilities (as to [...] "taking") did worm a little into the fortress. (Gilbert Cannan was one.) I have been reading over Tolstoi's interminable Peace and War, and am struck with the fact that I now protest as much as I admire. He doesn't do to read over, and that exactly is the answer to those who idiotically proclaim the impunity of such formless shape, such flopping looseness and such a denial of composition, selection and style. He has a mighty fund of life, but the waste, and the ugliness and vice of waste, the vice of a not finer doing, are sickening. For me he makes [...] "composition" [...] throne, by contrast, in effulgent lustre! ...|$|E
