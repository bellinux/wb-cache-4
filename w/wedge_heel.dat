40|$|ABSTRACT WOMEN’S HIGH HEEL DISCOMFORT ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION Kevin Blakley and Annamarie Kepple Women love high heeled shoes, {{but this}} love {{comes at the}} cost of comfort. Wearing high heels causes a lot of pain and, in the long term, health complications. This project tries to {{overcome}} the problem by ultimately making high heels more comfortable. In order to do this, one must first understand the reasons that high heels are uncomfortable, such as arch angle, heel height, and the changes in walking motion. Once there is a true understanding of the factors that contribute to high heel discomfort, the design stage can begin. The design selected for this project was a <b>wedge</b> <b>heel</b> that contained compressive material. This design would improve user comfort in four different criteria. These criteria were arch angle, compression of the shoe, foot rotation, and ground contact surface area of the heel. After the working prototype was created, it was performance tested in these four criteria against a standard stiletto heel and a standard wedge. The results of the prototype showed a great improvement in all of these criteria, resulting in a more comfortable high heel. However, there were a few areas that this prototype and the production process could be improved upon in the future. First, the prototype weight was a critical design factor, which resulted in a heel that is noticeably heavier then a standard high heel. Next, the cost to produce the prototype is much higher than is economically preferable if the shoes were to be sold for profit. Finally, a more refined manufacturing process would be more beneficial in creating a more aesthetically pleasing product...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Lateral <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> {{orthotics}} {{are designed}} to reduce medial tibiofemoral joint loading and pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). To date, the efficacy of long-term lateral <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> orthotics use among OA patients has not been determined. This study evaluated {{the extent to which}} lateral <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> orthotics reduced medial knee joint loading during walking and stair descent in knee OA patients. A secondary purpose was to measure the effects of lateral <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> orthotics on selected health-related quality of life parameters. A cohort of 36 men and women with moderate to severe medial knee OA were assigned to either an Orthotics group (mean age, 60. 8 ± 9. 8 yrs; mean BMI, 28. 1 ± 3. 71) or Control group (mean age, 61. 0 ± 9. 2 yrs; mean BMI, 28. 0 ± 4. 3). The Orthotics group wore a pair of custom-made 7 ° lateral <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> daily for 12 weeks. The Control group wore a pair of neutral inserts for 12 weeks. Pain and functional levels were assessed using a 100 -mm visual analog pain scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC™). Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data during level walking and stair descent were collected using a nine-camera motion analysis system synchronized with two strain gauge force plates. Subjects performed 5 walking trials and 5 stair descent trials at 3 different speeds, e. g., self-selected pace, slower, and faster. Biomechanical and health-related quality of life data were collected from subjects at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Using inverse dynamics equations, lower extremity joint moments and angles were calculated. Eleven dependent variables were analyzed with univariate Group (2) x Time (3) between/within ANOVAs. A weighted Bonferroni adjustment was used to protect against Type I error. During level walking trials, the early stance peak external knee adduction moment decreased 14. 6 % in the Orthotics group from Week 1 to Week 12 (p 0. 05). However, at Week 12 subjects in the Orthotics group had an average 47 % reduction in self-reported pain levels during stair descent compared with their pain scores at entry into the study (p = 0. 038). These findings suggest that lateral <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> orthotics can effectively lower medial knee joint loading for OA patients during level walking, while also reducing pain during the difficult task of descending stairs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Advances in the {{management}} of Achilles tendon rupture have {{led to the development of}} immediate weightbearing protocols. These vary regarding which ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are used and the number of inserted <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> used within them. Purpose: This study was conducted to evaluate plantar pressure measurements and temporal gait parameters within different AFOs, using different numbers of <b>heel</b> <b>wedges.</b> Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fifteen healthy participants were evaluated using 3 different AFOs, with 4 different levels of inserted <b>heel</b> <b>wedges.</b> Therefore, a total of 12 conditions were evaluated, in a sequence that was randomly allocated to each participant. Pressure and temporal gait parameters were measured using an in-shoe F-Scan pressure system, and range of movement was measured using an electrogoniometer. Results: Ankle-foot orthoses that were restrictive in design, combined with a higher number of inserted <b>heel</b> <b>wedges,</b> reduced forefoot pressures, increased heel pressures, and decreased the amount of time spent in the terminal stance and preswing phase of the gait cycle (P =. 029,. 002, and. 001). Conclusion: The choice of AFO design and the number of inserted <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> have a significant effect on plantar pressure measurements and temporal gait parameters. The implications of these changes need to be applied to the clinical management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures. This clinical management requires a balance between protected weightbearing and functional loading, requiring further research within a clinical context. Clinical Relevance: The biomechanical data from this research imply that a carbon-fiber AFO, with 1 heel raise, protects against excessive dorsiflexion while facilitating the restoration of near-normal gait parameters. This could lead to an accelerated return to function, avoiding the effects of disuse atrophy. This is in contrast to the rigid rocker-bottom AFO design with a greater number of heel-wedge inserts. However, research within a clinical context would be required to ascertain if these biomechanical advantages translate into a functional benefit for patients. The results should also be considered in relation to the amount of force a healing Achilles tendon can withstand...|$|R

40|$|The {{sagittal}} {{alteration of}} hoof balance {{is a common}} intervention in horses, with corrective shoeing {{being one of the}} most frequently applied methods of managing tendonitis. However, the effect of toe or heel elevation on tendon strains is poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the effect of toe and <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> on the superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon, and the third interosseous muscle or suspensory ligament strains using in vivo data and an accurate subject-specific model. Kinematic data were recorded using invasive markers at the walk and trot. Computerized tomography was then used to create a subject-specific model of an equine distal forelimb and strains were calculated for the superficial digital flexor tendon, the deep digital flexor tendon accessory ligament and the suspensory ligament for seven trials each of normal shoes, and toe and heel elevation. As the proximal interphalangeal joint is often ignored in strain calculations, its influence on the strain calculations was also tested. The deep ligament showed the same results for walk and trot with the <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> decreasing peak strain and the toe wedge increasing it. The opposite results were seen in the suspensory ligament and the superficial digital flexor tendon with the <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> increasing peak strain and the toe wedge decreasing it. The proximal interphalangeal joint was shown to be influential on the strains calculated with normal shoes and the calculated effect of the wedges.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanics}} behind Achilles tendinopathies {{and their respective}} treatments using a musculoskeletal modelling approach. Specifically, the eccentric heel-drop exercise used to treat Achilles tendinosis and orthotic <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> used to treat Achilles tendonitis were investigated, as the mechanics which drive tendon healing are not currently understood, but are believed to work by directly altering the mechanical loading of the Achilles tendon. An inverse dynamics model of the lower limb including the hip, knee ankle and MTP joints was developed to include a musculoskeletal foot and ankle model. An existing muscle geometry dataset was used, but a new algorithm to account for soft tissue and bony constraints at the ankle to ensure physiological musculo-tendon paths around the foot and ankle was developed. Optical motion, forceplate and instrumented pressure insole data was used to derive independent 3 D ground reaction vectors necessary for the data inputs {{for each of the}} two foot segments modelled. In addition to the moments of the hip and knee, foot and ankle muscle forces and ankle joint reaction forces were also estimated. A cohort of 19 healthy individuals performed the eccentric heel-drop exercise used to treat Achilles tendinosis and walked on a level and up and down an inclined (10 °) surface barefoot and in running shoes with and without prefabricated orthotic <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> used to treat Achilles tendonitis. Clinical questions regarding changes in lower limb mechanics due to variants of the eccentric heel-drop exercise and orthotic <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> were considered as well as model sensitivity to foot models and sources of centre of pressure (CoP) data. CoP data source and number of foot segments modelled did not consistently change the model outputs, with greater or worse similarity between sources depending on the specific phase of stance considered. An example of this are the reduced knee and hip extension moments and increased ankle dorsiflexion moments at heel-strike, but consistent peak ankle joint reaction and Achilles tendon forces due to different CoP inputs. Across all walking conditions, <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> were found to have minimal impact on Achilles tendon force, but {{had a significant impact on}} knee moments and secondary plantarflexors such as Tibialis Posterior and the toe flexor muscles. The ability of <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> to reduce Achilles tendon load during walking was not supported by this thesis. Key observations regarding the eccentric heel-drop exercise were the reductions in peak Achilles tendon force achieved when performing the exercise in running shoes compared to barefoot and with a flexed compared to extended knee. Given the increased difficulty in performing the flexed knee exercise, this questioned the efficacy of the flexed knee version of the task and possible changes to the rehabilitation protocol, incorporating the effect of shoes on peak Achilles tendon force were suggested.

50|$|The Teeter-Totter: In this {{returning}} challenge (which Andrew notes {{is being}} run {{later in the}} season than previously due to the drivers' habit of destroying the clutches on the test cars), the drivers are put at the wheel of a manual transmission car, which they are asked to balance on a teeter-totter. Flora takes the challenge first and, in what is rapidly becoming a familiar pattern, fails after running out of time due to Frank's constant criticism and attempts to micro-manage her driving; she also caused one of her car's tires to burst during the challenge, though this was not counted toward the half-hour she was given.

40|$|A shoe wearer's comfort {{is related}} to the shape of the footbed of a shoe. Even though the footbed shape is {{important}} in footwear design, there exists no methodology to evaluate the existing guidelines used in last making. Thirty-two females participated in an experiment where heel seat length, heel seat inclination and heel height were investigated using the profile assessment device. The dependent variables were plantar pressure and perceived feeling of each participant. The results show that perceived feel is best for wedge angles of 4 degrees and 5 degrees at a heel height of 25 mm, 10 degrees and 11 degrees at a heel height of 50 mm and 16 degrees and 18 degrees at a heel height of 75 mm.

An ulcer under the foot can develop in a couple of hours. The primary goal of therapeutic footwear is to prevent complications, which can include strain, ulcers, calluses, or even amputations for patients with diabetes and poor circulation. Neuropathy can also change the shape of a person's feet, which limits the range of shoes that can be worn comfortably. In addition to meeting strict guidelines, diabetic shoes must be prescribed by a physician and fit by a certified individual, such as an orthotist, podiatrist, therapeutic shoe fitter, or pedorthist. The shoes must also be equipped with a removable orthosis. Foot orthoses are devices such as shoe inserts, arch supports, or shoe fillers such as lifts, <b>wedges</b> and <b>heels.</b> The diabetic shoes and custom-molded inserts work together as a preventive system to help diabetics avoid foot injuries and improve mobility.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the loaded foot and the footbed is critical for footwear fit and comfort. Previous {{studies have shown that}} altering plantar pressure distributions can affect comfort. Hence a good fitting footbed is important for improving footwear comfort. The focus of this thesis was to investigate the necessary shape for the footbed in order to improve comfort for any foot shape. The perceived footwear fit in midfoot and forefoot in medio-lateral sides was highly correlated with the dimensional differences between foot and shoe-last in the corresponding regions. A fit that is neither tight nor loose can be achieved when the dimensional difference is around 8 mm on the width at toe region and around 15 mm on the midfoot width. In order to study various footbed shapes, a novel mechanical device was invented. The device was able to vary <b>heel</b> height, <b>heel</b> <b>wedge</b> angle, <b>heel</b> seat, shank shape, arch length and toe spring. The footbed shape deformations were estimated using structural bending theories where the largest estimation error found was 3. 70 mm at the midfoot region. Thereafter, the effects of footbed shapes on the plantar foot shape were studied in detail since the changes in foot shape have to be accounted for when designing shoes. It was found that the structure of the midfoot can change independently thereby creating changes in its plantar shape. The participants taking part in the experiment were able to judge these shape changes in the midfoot region and showed different preferences for different midfoot shapes. Knowing the characteristics of midfoot deformation, various footbed shapes were studied at different heel heights to understand their relation to perceived footwear comfort. It was found that there exists a unique footbed surface shape for the foot to feel comfortable at each tested heel height. In order to obtain such a footbed shape there are three conditions that have to be satisfied simultaneously: the contact area has to be higher than that of when standing on a flat surface, the peak pressure has to be lower than approximately 100 kPa and the percentage of force acting on the forefoot has to be approximately within 15 % to 22. 5 % of the total force. Prediction models (i. e. for each heel height) were proposed and validated based on the comfortable footbed shapes to predict the required footbed shape for given basic foot dimensions. An algorithm was proposed to transform an unconstrained 3 D foot shape (when standing on floor) in to a shape where the foot is supported on a comfortable footbed shape. The accuracy of the above mentioned 3 D foot modeling algorithm was within ± 1. 02 cm. The findings from this thesis, including the footbed prediction models and the invented device, have the potential to be integrated into footwear design, thus improving footwear comfort...|$|R

These differences will have a direct impact on the choice of the wedge system to be used for a particular treatment. Complete knowledge of the dosimetric characterisitics, including the surface and peripheral doses, is crucial in proper choice of particular wedge systems in clinical use...|$|R
40|$|Research on wire bonding, {{the most}} common chip {{interconnection}} technology, has been done for over 40 years by now. The most common description {{is a model of}} three phases: friction, approach and interdiffusion (Lang 1988; Osterwald 1999). To quantify this model, with the main aspect at the duration of the friction phase, ultrasonic oscillation was filmed with a high speed camera. A pulsed LED light-source allowed very short exposure times of 2 mu s. For the first time it was possible to make the movement of the wire visible in a reflected light exposure. After the friction phase, the end of friction (EOF) occurs. Laser vibration measurements of the tool and the pad amplitude turned out that the EOF correlates with a second, characteristic plateau of the pad amplitude. At this time, the tool amplitude has already shown its characteristic maximum and was attenuated to approximately 80 % of the maximum value. After the EOF, when the wedge is bonded to the pad, a bending of the wire towards the <b>wedge</b> in the <b>heel</b> region was observed. This is a possible reason for a weakening of the heel by the US-power. While a change of the wire texture could be proved in recent investigations (GeiAler et al. 2006), the exposure of the heel to reverse bending cycle was never verified before...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that high-heeled shoes {{may contribute to the}} development and progression of knee pain. However, surprisingly little research has been carried out on how shoe heel height affects muscle activity around the knee joint. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of differing heel height on the electromyographic (EMG) activity in vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) during a sit to stand activity. This was an exploratory study to inform future research. Methods A repeated measures design was used. Twenty five healthy females carried out a standardised sit to stand activity under 4 conditions; barefoot, and with <b>heel</b> <b>wedges</b> of 1, 3, and 5 cm in height. EMG activity was recorded from VM and VL during the activity. Data were analysed using 1 × 4 repeated measures ANOVA. Results Average rectified EMG activity differed with heel height in both VM (F 2. 2, 51. 7 = 5. 24, p 3, 72 = 5. 32, p 3, 72 = 0. 61, p = 0. 609). Conclusion We found that as heel height increased, there was an increase in EMG activity in both VM and VL, but no change in the relative EMG intensity of VM and VL as measured by the VM: VL ratio. This showed that no VM: VL imbalance was elicited. This study provides information that will inform future research on how heel height affects muscle activity around the knee joint. </p...|$|R
