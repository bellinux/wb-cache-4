25|$|Hangul is a {{featural}} alphabet {{written in}} morpho-syllabic blocks, and {{was designed for}} both the Korean and Chinese languages, though the letters specific to Chinese are now obsolete. Each block consists {{of at least one}} consonant letter and one vowel letter. When promulgated, the blocks reflected the morphology of Korean, but for most of the fifteenth century they were organized into syllables. In the twentieth century the morpho-syllabic tradition was revived. The blocks were traditionally written in vertical columns from top to bottom, although they are now commonly written in horizontal rows from left to right as <b>well.</b> <b>Spacing</b> has been introduced to separate words in the Western fashion, and punctuation to indicate clauses and sentences, so that Hangul now transcribes Korean at the levels of feature, segment, syllable, morpheme, word, clause, and sentence. However, the suprasegmental features of tone and vowel length, seen as single and double tick marks {{to the left of the}} syllabic blocks in the image in the next section, have been dropped. Six new letters, including two of Sejong's which had become obsolete, were introduced in North Korea in 1948 in order to make Hangul a perfect morphophonological fit to the Korean language, but they were soon discarded.|$|E

50|$|Verticordia carinata is a slender, spindly shrub which {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 0.4-1.0 m and has a single, {{branching}} stem at its base.

5000|$|<b>Well</b> <b>spacing</b> - All wells are spaced at {{a minimum}} 1,000 feet offset from another well. This {{minimizes}} surface impact by disturbing {{only a small amount}} of the available land.

5000|$|Directional {{drilling}} {{allows a}} large hydrocarbon reservoir to be accessed using a single well pad, {{such as in}} Europe's biggest onshore oilfield, Wytch Farm. Likely <b>well</b> <b>spacing</b> visualised by the December 2013 DECC Strategic Environmental Assessment report indicated that well pad spacings of 5 km were likely in crowded areas, with up to 3 hectares per well pad. Each pad could have 24 separate wells. This amounts to 0.16% of land area.|$|E
5000|$|The Mesa {{field was}} entirely {{developed}} by small operators. As {{the land was}} subdivided into parcels before oil was discovered, it was a [...] "town-lot" [...] field, and parcel owners were able to drill on their own land without regard for the optimum spacing of wells on a field-wide basis (<b>well</b> <b>spacing</b> is now more tightly regulated in California). In 1934 there were 34 separate operators on 35 leases; the largest operator had only six wells.|$|E
50|$|When {{the battery}} {{multiple}} unit was introduced, services were doubled to six trains {{a day from}} 21 April 1958, and Sunday service reinstated. The line was chosen for testing the unit because the stations were <b>well</b> <b>spaced</b> and the 1 in 70 ruling gradients would require substantial discharge rates.|$|R

The outer, mature whorl separates from the coil but hooks back quickly, {{referred to as a}} heteromorph.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel design method for {{ground source heat pump}}. The ground source heat pump {{operation}} is controllable by using several parameters, {{such as the}} total meters of buried pipe, the <b>space</b> between <b>wells,</b> the thermal properties of soil, thermal resistance of the well, the initial temperature of soil, and annual dynamic load. By studying the effect of well number and <b>well</b> <b>space,</b> we conclude that with the increase of the well number, the inlet and outlet water temperatures decrease in summer and increase in winter, which enhance the efficiency of ground source heat pump. The <b>well</b> <b>space</b> slightly affects the water temperatures, but it affects the soil temperature to some extent. Also the ground source heat pump operations matching with cooling tower are investigated to achieve the thermal balance. This method greatly facilitates ground source heat pump design...|$|R

[...] A study published in 2015 on the Fayetteville Shale found that a mature gas field impacted about 2% of the land area and substantially increased edge habitat creation. Average land impact per well was 3 hectares (about 7 acres) ...|$|E

50|$|With this backing, in July 1938 the {{province}} {{set up the}} Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board (today known as the Energy Resources Conservation Board).

50|$|The {{icterine warbler}} is a bird of {{woodland}} rather than forest, preferring woodland edge or glades, favouring the crowns of <b>well</b> <b>spaced</b> trees with tall undergrowth.

5000|$|The primary {{delivery}} mechanism for ISCO is through perforated, hollow metal rods hammered {{into the ground}} by [...] "direct-push" [...] drilling methods or by injecting the oxidant into wells installed using hollow stem auger, rotary drilling methods. One advantage of injection wells {{is that they can}} be used for multiple applications of the oxidant material, while direct push injection techniques are generally quicker and less expensive. Injection wells for ozone are typically constructed of a 1-2" [...] stainless-steel screen set in sand pack, grouted to the surface using a combination of cement and bentonite clay. Often, a field pilot study must be performed to determine injection parameters and <b>well</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{assist with}} {{increasing}} the recovery factor, {{two types of}} Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) are being evaluated which could increase the recovery by up to 25%. The less riskier and costly {{of them would be}} to undertake a Polymer flood instead of a traditional water flood. This is strategy is not very dependent on the oil price, well location or extensive testing. The other option is to undertake Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer flooding (ASP). ASP flooding would be riskier in terms of costs, <b>well</b> <b>spacing,</b> development time (five years), and would be more sensitive to the oil price. However, the rewards for it are significantly higher, potentially increasing the incremental reserves by 25% when compared to polymer or water flooding.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{the normal}} 40 acre spacing {{employed}} elsewhere in West Texas proved impossible on the Spraberry; wells that close competed against each other, as yields per-acre from the difficult reservoir were dropping into the hundreds, {{rather than the}} expected thousands of barrels. Oil companies resorted to {{the unusual step of}} asking the Railroad Commission of Texas, the regulatory body which decided on <b>well</b> <b>spacing</b> and production quota, to require 80 acre, and then even 160 acre spacing to allow each drilling site to be profitable. [...] Many of the initial wells were abandoned {{in the next few years}} as they ran out of oil; modern enhanced recovery techniques, such as carbon dioxide injection, were not yet available.|$|E
50|$|Eremophila enata is a {{spreading}} shrub, usually {{growing to}} {{a height of}} less than 0.3 m and has stems that are rough and hairy. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are <b>well</b> <b>spaced,</b> elliptic to egg-shaped, mostly 9-20 mm long and 3-9 mm wide. Their edges are serrated and the surfaces covered with glandular hairs.|$|R
50|$|They forage {{for food}} on beaches and tidal flats, usually by sight. The food {{consists}} of small molluscs, polychaete worms, crustaceans, and insects. It is less gregarious {{than the other}} Pluvialis species, not forming dense feeding flocks, instead feeding widely dispersed over beaches, with birds <b>well</b> <b>spaced</b> apart. They will however form dense flocks on high tide roosts.|$|R

Moulds allowed more complexity, including scenes with children, landscapes and other animals.|$|R
