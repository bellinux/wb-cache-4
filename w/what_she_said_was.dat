5|$|The {{restrictions}} were also applied to television drama, documentary and discussion programmes. In December 1988 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, ordered Channel 4 to cancel {{an episode of}} the US drama series Lou Grant that featured {{the story of a}} fictional IRA gunrunner, even though it had aired previously. Mother Ireland, a 1988 documentary about women and Irish nationalism that included an interview with Mairéad Farrell, subsequently shot dead during an SAS operation in Gibraltar, was also initially banned. When screened by Channel 4 during a season about censorship in April 1991, Farrell's words on republicanism were muted, with on-screen subtitles. On a later occasion the appearance of the political activist Bernadette Devlin McAliskey on an edition of the BBC's Nation discussing reasons for political violence was also censored when much of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> subtitled.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1429 during the Hundred Years' War, in {{obedience}} to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> the command of God, Joan of Arc inspired the Dauphin's armies {{in a series of}} stunning military victories which lifted the siege of Orleans and destroyed {{a large percentage of the}} remaining English forces at the battle of Patay. A series of military setbacks eventually led to her capture in the Spring of 1430 by the Burgundians, who were allied with the English. They delivered her to them for 10,000 livres. In December of that same year she was transferred to Rouen, the military headquarters and administrative capital in France of King Henry VI of England, and placed on trial for heresy before a Church court headed by Bishop Pierre Cauchon, a supporter of the English.|$|E
500|$|Nimoy called Megan Parlen [...] "phenomenal" [...] in {{her role}} as the young Ro, and {{compared}} her to Christina Ricci. Taylor also praised Parlen, calling her fantastic in the role. Because of the expectation that Forbes would not return to the role of Ro after [...] "Rascals", Taylor suggested at one point keeping the character as a child since her return to adulthood was not seen on screen. She suggested it to Piller and Berman, but said that they looked as if <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> [...] "absolutely insane". Taylor said it remained a good idea, as she felt that only Star Trek could have a character changed into the body of the child and yet still fly the ship. [...] "Rascals" [...] marked the only appearance by Forbes during the sixth season, but she later returned for the penultimate episode of the series, [...] "".|$|E

2500|$|The report, {{released}} in December, found that 76percent of the 190transcripts reviewed contained grading inaccuracies {{and that a}} majority of these changes had a positive effect on the student's transcript.

6000|$|So Phyllis {{was called}} and told. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "I only hope {{he will make}} her {{understand}} {{that it could not}} be helped, and it was not Angela's fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|At noon on {{the next}} day Lily had still said nothing to her mother about the letter; and then <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> very little. [...] "When must you answer Mr. Crosbie, mamma?" ...|$|E
50|$|That's <b>What</b> <b>She</b> <b>Said</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} EP by The Friday Night Boys. It was {{released}} on October 14, 2008 with Fueled By Ramen and produced by Sean Small.|$|R
60|$|The crowd sighed audibly, {{broke up}} into couples, and {{followed}} them. Freda pouted {{and went in}} with Cal Galbraith; {{but she had a}} good heart and a sure tongue, and she spoiled his oysters for him. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> of no importance, but his face went red and white at intervals, and he swore repeatedly and savagely at himself.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court martial}} was adjourned later that day, and was {{scheduled}} to reconvene on 17 January. The session was postponed until the 18th, however, and began with Malimali calling for the court martial panel to be dismissed on account of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> [...] "anomalies in the swearing-in process." [...] Court Martial President Apakuki Kurusiga rejected the call for {{the dissolution of the}} panel.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was not as}} he {{had promised}} them--he had not promised them Mrs. Beale; but Maisie said nothing about that. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> simply: [...] "I knew you had come. Mrs. Wix told me." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "You see, if you plague Bessie too much, to {{make her}} like ourselves, when she is really so different, you are driving her to the shamming you despise so much." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> of no moment, but {{the fact}} that she had {{received}} him without sign of coldness was eloquent, and the man bent very respectfully over the little white hand. Then he stood straight and square for a moment and met her eyes.|$|E
50|$|Spiegel confronted Wilbur, {{who responded}} that the {{publisher}} would not publish the book unless it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it <b>was.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{thinness}} of {{the poor}} girl's cheek, and the sharpness of her features, bore witness {{to the truth of}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> Morton <b>was</b> greatly shocked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you sure, Mr. Magnet," [...] Mrs. Pope went on {{as their}} {{emotions}} subsided, [...] "that <b>she</b> really meant <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said?</b> Girls <b>are</b> very strange creatures----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh; {{just the}} old story, mother, I suppose. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> what I knew {{just as well}} before I went there. But yet it was {{necessary}} that I should hear {{what she had to}} say;--and as necessary I think that she should hear me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> true, {{and winter}} started in earnest {{the very next}} day, snowing for {{the best part of}} a week, and then turning off bitterly cold. Yet {{firewood}} was to be had in plenty and the cabin was kept warm and comfortable for all.|$|E
60|$|They {{were sitting}} {{opposite}} {{one another in}} the train, and Philip, listening sympathetically to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> quite happy. He was amused at her naivete and slightly touched. There was a very faint colour in her cheeks. He was thinking that it would be delightful to kiss the tip of her chin.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2015 it {{was heard}} at Southwark Crown Court that Smith {{was one of}} two bishops {{responsible}} for allowing Father Antony McSweeney to be appointed as a priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia following an incident in 1998 in which [...] "a housekeeper found <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> pornographic images at his Mscweeney's home." [...] The matter was regarded by Smith as an incident for clergy discipline and not investigated by the police. McSweeney has since been jailed for abusing boys at the Grafton House children's home between 1978 and 1981.|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't think," [...] he {{said after}} a pause, [...] "that my sister meant <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> indignant and excited, and I don't think that her words could be taken as evidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't exactly {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very {{grave and}} <b>said</b> it <b>was</b> no laughing matter, {{or something of}} that kind, and she {{walked up and down}} and begged me to be quiet and let her think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame la Duchesse, I humbly pray your Grace [...] . . ." [...] entreated Hector whose wrinkled, parchment-like {{face had}} become the colour of a peony, and who, torn between the respect which he had for the great lady and his horror at <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> ready to sink through the floor in his confusion.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a curious}} little {{vibration}} {{he could not}} quite repress in his voice, and both he and his companion were, under the circumstances, silent a trifle too long, for {{there are times when}} silence is very expressive. Then it was Barbara who spoke, though she felt that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> not especially appropriate.|$|E
60|$|But some civil answer {{convinced}} Ethel that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> interesting, and {{she would}} not be stopped in her account of their anxieties {{on the day of the}} examination. Flora was pleased that Meta, catching some words, begged to hear more, and Flora gave an account of the matter, soberer in terms, but quietly setting Norman at a much greater distance from all his competitors.|$|E
60|$|Lady Frances {{of course}} {{answered}} her lover's letter; but of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it <b>is</b> only necessary {{that the reader}} should know that she promised that in all things she would be entirely guided by his wishes.|$|R
60|$|But <b>what</b> more <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> drowned by {{the voice}} of Mrs. Aleshine, who screamed for Elizabeth Grootenheimer, and who was now so much excited that she was {{actually}} trying to break open her own gate.|$|R
5000|$|As {{quickly as}} the {{societies}} formed, differences arose leading to new societies. In 1891 Flora Adams Darling (Vice Regent of the DAR) resigned from the DAR to form the Daughters of the Revolution (DR); it became a more [...] "exclusive" [...] society, as it would not accept [...] "collateral descendants" [...] as members and was limited to direct descendants. Her actions were also prompted by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> McDowell's ambition to exploit the SAR and DAR as organizations {{on which to build}} a presidential campaign. The DR is now defunct and its remaining members may have joined the DAR.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{looked at}} herself in this character--looked intently, {{thinking}} she filled it with a certain grace. But <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> not an expression of any such complacency. [...] "You don't offend me; but you ought to remember that, without being offended, one may be incommoded, troubled." [...] "Incommoded," [...] she heard herself saying that, and it struck her as a ridiculous word. But it was what stupidly came to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "She’s a’ right," [...] said Mr. Boom; [...] "me an’ her ’ve {{just had}} a few words. She picked up {{something}} off the floor <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> a cake o’ mud off my heel. Said she wouldn’t have it," [...] continued Mr. Boom, his voice rising. [...] "My own floor too. Swep’ it {{up off the floor}} with a dustpan and brush, and held it in front of me to look at." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> {{undoubtedly}} {{noble and}} selfless. Lady Blakeney felt {{in her heart}} that her keenest sympathy should have gone out to this young woman--pretty, dainty, hardly more than a girl--who seemed to be devoting her young life in a purely philanthropic and unselfish cause. And yet in spite of herself, Marguerite seemed unable to shake off that curious sense of mistrust which had assailed her from the first, nor that feeling of unreality and staginess with which the Frenchwoman's attitude had originally struck her.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts {{wrote in}} a variety of genres: poetry, short stories, children’s literature, nonfiction, science fiction and fantasy, and novels. She was the only woman invited to the first science-fiction writer's conference in 1956 in Milford, PA. The couple moved to Elmira, NY, in 1960, to find steady {{part-time}} work - Rob in the local greeting card company, Jane in an art gallery. Their lives seemed set, their art defined. Now in her 30s, she and her husband began to record <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> messages from a personality named [...] "Seth," [...] and she wrote several books about the experience.|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} <b>she</b> {{believed}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> for there <b>were</b> moments {{when she was}} very mad indeed.|$|R
60|$|Irene {{liked being}} talked to better than talking, {{and when her}} sister was by she was always, tacitly or explicitly, {{referring}} to her for confirmation of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> content to sit and look pretty {{as she looked at}} the young man and listened to her sister's drolling. She laughed and kept glancing at Corey {{to make sure that he}} was understanding her. When they went out on the veranda to see the moon on the water, Penelope led the way and Irene followed.|$|R
