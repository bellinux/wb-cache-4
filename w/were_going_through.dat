5|$|In December 1988, the Ramones {{recorded}} {{material for}} their eleventh studio album, Brain Drain; co-produced by Beauvoir, Rey, and Bill Laswell. However, the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators' Andy Shernoff. Dee Dee Ramone would only record the additional vocals {{on the album}} citing that {{the other members of}} the band (including himself) <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> personal troubles and changes to the point where he didn't want to be in the band anymore. After the band finished their Halfway to Sanity tour in February 1989, Dee Dee became sober and left the band.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through.</b> I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from {{the political and social}} issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{took over}} as manager of Derby County in November 1982, to the great {{surprise}} of {{most people in the}} game. He brought in Roy McFarland as his assistant, and signed Archie Gemmill and Bobby Davison. At the time Derby <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> serious financial problems and were bottom of the table, but he steered them to a mid-table position {{by the end of the}} season with a 15-match unbeaten run. In the Third Round of the FA Cup on 8 January 1983 they knocked out Clough's Forest team with a 2–0 win at the Baseball Ground. They reached the Fifth Round, where they were knocked out by Manchester United.|$|E

In 1933, the regiment took part in a recruiting drive by conducting a march through Scotland, including a three-day traverse of the Cairngorm Mountains to get better publicity. Although budgets were lean, the Scots Greys, like other British cavalry regiments, were finally re-equipped. Each troop would now contain an automatic weapons section.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{there are}} 41 medical schools in South Korea. Medical {{programs}} in South Korea {{used to be}} direct-entry programs {{such as in the}} UK, taking six years to complete.

25|$|Count 1: Conversion of telecom {{concession}} fees into excise charges. Previously, telecom operators {{had to pay}} the TOT/CAT {{a percentage}} of their revenue as a concession fee (TOT/CAT are state-owned enterprises, although they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> the process of privatisation). The Thaksin government modified this into a system wherein all operators would instead directly pay the government an equivalent excise tax. The imposition of excise tax here would eventually {{be passed on to}} consumers. Thaksin claimed that all operators continued to pay the same total costs. The judges ruled that this benefited AIS while harming the TOT, and thus was an abuse of power.|$|E

After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, {{he was the one who}} sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows.

Although things {{seemed to be going}} smoothly from outside, they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> problems. Misunderstanding arose between the members and singer Greenway was expelled from the band in late/mid 1996. Greenway went to record with Extreme Noise Terror (the ENT release Damage 381 features Barney on lead vocals) and ENT's main singer Phil Vane went to fill vocals slot in Napalm Death. Things did not go as well as they were supposed to, and Vane was kicked out of the band just before they got into the studio to record the new album. And so Greenway returned to Napalm Death.|$|E
25|$|Nkrumah never {{returned}} to Ghana, but he continued to push for his vision of African unity. He lived in exile in Conakry, Guinea, as the guest of President Ahmed Sékou Touré, who made him honorary co-president of the country. Nkrumah read, wrote, corresponded, gardened, and entertained guests. Despite retirement from public office, {{he felt that he}} was still threatened by Western intelligence agencies. When his cook died mysteriously, he feared that someone would poison him, and began hoarding food in his room. He suspected that foreign agents <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> his mail, and lived in constant fear of abduction and assassination. In failing health, he flew to Bucharest, Romania, for medical treatment in August 1971. He died of prostate cancer in April 1972 at the age of 62.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that other orchid genera bearing {{cylindrical}} leaves devolved this sort of leaves as a defense to climate changes their habitats <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> along the eras. Terete leaves are capable of much more water and nutrients and to face longer drought periods than species bearing thin leaves, on the other hand, almost all epiphytic species presenting the former type of leaves show more or less atrophied pseudobulbs since the leaves carry on its accumulating role. It is a supposition that Scuticaria species should have once inhabited much drier through their evolution. Because most of the species are found in shadier and more humid species now, this may {{one of the reasons}} why their culture uses to be complicated, possibly because the delicate balance they reached in nature is broken. For the same reason it is supposed their frequency in nature is only occasion or rare.|$|E
