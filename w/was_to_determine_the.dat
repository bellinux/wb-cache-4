5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> rates of {{hybridization}} between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than {{are found in}} the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E

25|$|A {{large part}} of Albert A. Bühlmann's {{research}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> longest half time compartments for Nitrogen and Helium, and he {{increased the number of}} compartments to 16. He investigated the implications of decompression after diving at altitude and published decompression tables that could be used at a range of altitudes. Bühlmann used a method for decompression calculation similar to that proposed by Workman, which included M-values expressing a linear relationship between maximum inert gas pressure in the tissue compartments and ambient pressure, but based on absolute pressure, which made them more easily adapted for altitude diving. Bühlmann's algorithm was used to generate the standard decompression tables for a number of sports diving associations, and is used in several personal decompression computers, sometimes in a modified form.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Terry-McElarth {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study in}} the American Journal of Preventative Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school beverage availability and student consumption.

The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.|$|E
