The works are the Swedish dictionary Ordbok öfver svenska språket (1850 – 55) by A. F. Dalin and the Danish dictionary Dansk Ordbog (…) (1833) by C. Molbech. The focus is, among other things, on the frequencies and types of <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> that are represented in the data. Furthermore, I consider in which entries the <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> are found, and {{the position of the}} expressions in the microstrucure of the articles.

Based upon the criteria of the establishing of the idiomatic status of <b>word</b> <b>combinations,</b> traditionally used in contemporary lexicology, the author marks out four stages of the entry of units containing proper names and their derivatives into a regional idiomatic inventory: 1) <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> with figurative meanings and transparent motivation easily decoded by {{every member of the}} local community (e. g., naryaditsa kak Anisya Klimovskaya ‘to be slovenly dressed’); 2) <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> with a proper name localizing a nationally known idiom (e. g., zhelninsky telyonok ‘screaming person’); 3) <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> including a name with a general meaning (e. g., Masha s Yashey ‘two inseparable persons’); 4) idioms with non-transparent motivation (e. g., tutursky pop ‘cuckoo male’).

40|$|Abstract Although {{a number}} of {{dictionaries}} of collocations have appeared in recent years —mostly in languages other than French —the notion of ‘collocation’ remains somewhat fuzzy around the edges. A collocation is generally under-stood to {{be a combination of}} two lexemes that are semantically independent but which are linked together by a strong, restrictive association. Neverthe-less it is not always easy to determine the boundaries of this type of affinity. Between the extremes of completely free <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> and completely frozen idioms, collocations (as defined above) clearly occupy an intermediate portion of the spectrum. At each edge of this middle ground, however, there are grey areas where one finds <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> which might or might not be classed as collocations. After first demonstrating that associative <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> do indeed form a continuum of this kind, we propose some parameters to help delimit the scope of collocations in everyday contemporary French...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{a class of}} word groups that lies between idioms and free <b>word</b> <b>combinations.</b> Idiomatic expressions are those in which the semantics of the whole cannot be deduced from the meanings of the individual constituents. Free <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> have the properties {{that each of the}} words can be replaced by another without seriously modifying the overall meaning of the composite unit and if one of the words is omitted, a reader cannot easily infer it from the remaining ones. Unlike free <b>word</b> <b>combinations,</b> a collocation is a group of words that occur together more often than by chance. On the other hand, unlike idioms, individual words in a collocation can contribute to the overall semantics of the compound. We present some definitions and examples of collocations, as well as methods for their extraction and classification. The use of collocations for word sense disambiguation, text generation, and machine translation is also part of this chapter. While most computational lexicons represent properties of individual words, i...|$|R

Japanese learners {{may be able}} to construct grammatically correct sentences, however, these may sound “unnatural”. In this work, we analyze correct <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> using different collocation measures and word similarity methods. While other methods use well-formed text, our approach makes use of a large Japanese language learner corpus for generating collocation candidates, in order to build a system that is more sensitive to con-structions that are difficult for learners. Our results show that we get better results com-pared to other methods that use only well-formed text. ...|$|R

The ellipsis can correspond to a non-constituent catena, which means a movement analysis in terms of QR is not needed. The catena is a concrete unit of syntactic analysis associated with dependency grammar (DG); it is defined as any word or any <b>word</b> <b>combination</b> that is continuous with respect to dominance.

Such a <b>word</b> <b>combination</b> could not be predicted on its own, as {{it does not mean}} [...] "a stranger who is perfect" [...] as we should expect.

The first experiment showed that perceived frequency of <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> roughly followed the objective count. Anot­her recurrent quality of words, constructional tendency, was supplemented as independent variable in the two following experiments. This variable reflects a words tendency to appear in <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> and it was found to interact with frequency when subjects rated frequency and comprehensibility. The experiments showed that word collocations, defined at the levels of combinations and constructional tendency of individual words, can be supposed to have psychological counterparts; that linguis­tic recurrence seems to have cognitive representations. digitalisering@umu. s...|$|R
