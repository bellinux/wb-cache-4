However, only a few clinical cases {{have been reported in}} the literature that describes Trachinus species envenomation. Here, we presented a case poisoned by a <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> and tried to describe the signs/symptoms and treatment modalities of the <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> envenomation and also tried to emphasize poisonings that could be far from the sea with dead sea creatures...|$|R
40|$|Marine animals use toxins {{which they}} produce for hunting and self-defense. These toxins can cause {{morbidity}} and rarely, mortality in humans. In our manuscript, we aimed to review envenomation and injury caused by <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> (Trachinidae) in Turkey and to delineate principles of approaching these patients. We present {{the case of}} one patient who was evaluated in the emergency department {{as a result of}} a probable <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> envenomation...|$|R

2500|$|Sea {{life can}} {{sometimes}} cause injuries and even fatalities. Animals such as sharks, stingrays, <b>Weever</b> <b>fish,</b> seals and jellyfish can sometimes present a danger. Warmer-water surfers often do the [...] "stingray shuffle" [...] {{as they walk}} out through the shallows, shuffling their feet in the sand to scare away stingrays that may be resting on the bottom.|$|R
40|$|Background: Injury by {{the sting}} of Lesser <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> (Trachinus vipera) may lead to severe pain, edema or tissue necrosis. Cellular effects of the venom are still incompletely understood. Previous {{observations}} revealed that purified Lesser <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> venom (LWFV) induces suicidal death of erythrocytes and HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells. The present study addressed {{the effect of the}} venom on colon carcinoma cell toxicity, shape and migration both in p 53 +/+ and/or p 53 -/- conditions. Methods: Cells were exposed to medium without or with 500 µg/ ml LWFV. Cell shape, cell area and circularity were visualized and quantified by fluorescence microscopy. Cell volume, granularity and cells toxicity were assessed via the apoptotic parameters dissipation of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, phosphatidylserine surface exposure and cell membrane permeabilization were measured utilizing flow cytometry. Cell migration was evaluated using wound healing assay and two-dimensional migration assay. Results: LWFV treatment was followed by a marked change of cell shape and size, significant decrease of cell area and circularity, significant impairment of cell migration, as well as induction of apoptosis after long exposition. Conclusions: LWFV exposure leads to cell shrinkage, increased granularity, apoptosis and impairment of cell migration, effects presumably contributing to LWFV-induced tissue injury...|$|R
50|$|He {{married in}} 1844 {{and began to}} study {{medicine}} {{in order to become}} a surgeon. In 1850, Winkler moved to Haarlem with his wife and four children, to begin his education at the local surgeons' college. He graduated two years later, and set up practice in Nieuwediep. His first patient, a fisherman, complained of being stung by a <b>weever</b> <b>fish.</b> His studies took him to the library of Teylers Museum in Haarlem, and his subsequent article on the weever in the popular journal Album der Natuur established him as an expert on fishes.|$|R
50|$|Tourists are {{attracted}} by, among others, the marina (311 berths inside, 60 visitor berths, and 95 anchorages). Fishing activity {{is important and}} diversified in the fishing port: fish (flounder, pouting, dogfish), but mostly crustaceans (spider crabs, crabs, and lobsters). There are numerous activities: swimming and water sports, angling (on the beach Barneville at low tide in the rocks or sand there are limpets, cockles, whelks, periwinkles, crabs, velvet crabs, and shrimp. At Carteret point {{it is possible to}} find <b>Weever</b> <b>fish.</b> There is also hiking in the dunes, golf, and horseback riding.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} meant to follow that on <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> stings which {{appeared}} in this periodical in Dec. 1973. In that paper the immediate and complete relief obtained in ten patients by means of local Lignocaine infiltration in {{the proximity of the}} puncture site of weever stings was described. Since that paper was written three other cases have been similarly treated and these are described in this article. The relative treatments are also indicated, namely by Lignocaine infiltration. In essence, these studies indicated that weever toxin affects the human heart as well, and the precordial pain experienced by victims during the acute episode is in fact cardiac pain. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|There {{are various}} species of <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> (Maltese traċna). A list of fish {{belonging}} to the family Trachnideae in the Mediterranean is provided. They can inflict painful stings on the feet of victims walking or paddling in very shallow sandy waters. When the fish attacks its victim it injects a neurotoxin which causes considerable pain. The paucity of medical literature about this subject, and the vagueness of the different methods of treatment and management described have prompted the author to write this paper. All the cases listed Seen by the author {{in the last five}} years have recovered completely. None of the patients needed transfer to hospital and no one developed any residual weakness or paralysis. An injection of a local anesthetic has so far always produced good results and is by far a more sterile procedure. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A habitat {{specific}} {{survey of}} the epifauna and fish fauna of sandbanks off the Welsh coastline was undertaken in 2001. Of these, three sandbanks were considered to represent extensions of shallow nearshore soft-sediment communities, while a further six sandbanks {{were considered to be}} distinct sandbanks; seabed features clearly defined in comparison with surrounding sediments. Multivariate community analyses revealed that the distinct sandbanks had both fish and epifaunal assemblages that were distinct from those sandbanks considered to be extensions of nearshore sediments. The distinct sandbanks were typified by low species diversity and shared indicator species such as the <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> Echiichthys vipera, the shrimp Philocheras trispinosus and the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Differences occurred in species composition among the distinct sandbanks, in particular, southern sandbanks were typified by sand sole Solea lascaris and small-eyed ray Raja microocellata. The sandbanks considered as extensions of nearshore sediments shared many similarities with the Pleuronectes platessa–Limanda limanda assemblage, identified by Ellis et al. (Estuar. Coastal Shelf Sci. 51 (2000) 299), which is widespread in the Irish Sea. Sandbanks, as a habitat definition under the EU habitats directive, are likely to incorporate a number of physically and biologically distinct habitats of which two have been described in the present study...|$|R
40|$|The {{species and}} size {{selectivity}} of long-lines using small hooks were studied off the south coast of Portugal using ''Mustad'' brand round bent, flatted sea hooks (Quality 2316 DT) numbers 15, 13, and 11 baited with razor shell clam (Ei-isis siliqua). Hook numbers 13 and 11 are 49 and 109 % larger respectively than number 15 hooks {{in terms of}} overall size (maximum width x maximum length). A total of 39 900 hooks were fished in 45 sets and 35 species of fish and cephalopods were caught. As a group, 13 species of sea breams (Sparidae) dominated the catch by numbers (58 %) and weight (73 %). Six species of sea breams, along with the greater <b>weever</b> <b>fish</b> (Trachinus draco) accounted for 81 % of the total catch by weight, with the common or white sea bream (Diplodus sargus) bring the most important (29 %). Catch size distributions by hook size were, in general, highly overlapped for all species and hook size had little apparent effect on minimum size at capture. All hooks caught {{a wide range of}} sizes per species, but the catch rate (number of fish per 100 hooks) was significantly lower for the largest hook. Except for the black sea bream (Spondyliosoma cantharus), capture of illegally sized or immature fish was minimal. Small increases in average size with hook size were evident for four species: Diplodus sargus, D. vulgaris, Lithognathus mormyrus and Serranus cabrilla. No differences in size selectivity were detected for Boops boops, D. annularis, Spondyliosoma cantharus and Trachinus draco. A skew-normal model adequately described differences in size selectivity in five of six species. (C) 1996 International Council for the Exploration of the Se...|$|R
50|$|The beach of Praia do monte Clérigo {{is inside}} the Vicentine Coast Natural Park, an area of {{outstanding}} natural beauty. The beach is {{near the village of}} Aljezur and is totally unspoilt by the ravages of tourism. The beach has good access points from the road and car park {{to the rear of the}} main beach area. There is a timber ramp and stairways down to the sand. The beach is of fine gold sand and is very clean. The southern end of the beach has unusual and extensive rock formations, amongst which visitors can observe a diverse marine life in the pools and gullies between the rocks. There is an abundance of starfish, crabs, Shrimps and Barnacles. Within the rock crevices at the tide line Octopus can be seen and in the deeper rock pools there are shoals of juvenile fish such as Sea Bream. When the tide is out a shallow lagoon is left on the beach. The lagoon is a safe popular stretch of water both for children and their parents, although in the lagoon visitors should take care as <b>Weever</b> <b>fish</b> can sometimes be found in these waters. These fish sting unaware swimmers if trod on, but the risk is minimal. The sea, when conditions are right, is a popular spot for surfing and bodyboarding, and in the season there is a surf school. Please be aware that there is a strong undertow and current just of the beach. Along the south east fringe of the beach there is an area of sand dunes. Beyond the dunes in the south there is a small settlement of mainly holiday homes. At the northern end of the beach there are panoramic views across this small cove.|$|R
50|$|Weevers (or weeverfish) are 9 extant {{species of}} fishes of family Trachinidae, order Perciformes. They are long (up to 37 cm), mainly brown in color, and have venomous spines {{on their first}} dorsal fins and gills. During the day, weevers bury {{themselves}} in sand, just showing their eyes, and snatch prey as it comes past, which consists of shrimp and small <b>fish.</b> <b>Weevers</b> are unusual in not having swim bladders, as do most bony fish, and as a result, sink {{as soon as they}} stop actively swimming. With the exception of T. cornutus from the southeast Pacific, all species in this family are restricted to the eastern Atlantic (including the Mediterranean). A tenth, extinct species, Callipterus speciosus, is known from the Monte Bolca lagerstätte of the Lutetian epoch.|$|R
