5|$|The {{alternating}} {{succession of}} {{the northern and southern}} Uí Néill to the kingship of Tara <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> break down in time of Brian Boru. It was already under strain before Flann Sinna's lifetime. Two branches of the Uí Néill—the northern Cenél Conaill and the southern Síl nÁedo Sláine— had already been excluded from the succession by the Cenél nEógain and Clann Cholmáin. Many other branches of the Uí Néill had never shared in the kingship.|$|E

5|$|When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a {{week after}} she'd sent it to Perkins, he was furious. The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage. In letters, Scott berated her and fumed that the novel had drawn upon the autobiographical {{material}} {{that he planned to}} use in Tender Is the Night, which he'd been working on for years, and which <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> see publication in 1934.|$|E
5|$|For {{his first}} foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story {{based on a}} Life {{magazine}} article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> make Runaway Train, though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, 2013, it was {{confirmed}} that a Veronica Mars film <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> {{be coming to}} fruition. Bell and series creator Rob Thomas, launched a fundraising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $2 million goal in less than ten hours. The main cast members of the series all reprised their roles in the feature film. Production of the film took place during summer 2013, and it was released theatrically and on video-on-demand on March 14, 2014.|$|E

5|$|She {{then had}} the idea to weave some of it, so she kept some for herself. Having {{observed}} {{the life of the}} silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, sericulture. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan. This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was forced}} to regroup at Cheonan and oppose the North Korean forces again, and it suffered heavy casualties before being forced to withdraw after the Battle of Cheonan. The 24th Infantry Division would continue to fight in delaying actions {{such as this one}} for two more weeks until it was overwhelmed at the Battle of Taejon, however by that time the Pusan Perimeter would be in place, and other US divisions would be able to hold the line for several more months during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter until the Inchon Landings, when American forces <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> defeat the North Korean Army, ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death. Philip held {{a peace conference}} in November 1188, making a public offer of a generous long-term peace settlement with Henry, conceding to his various territorial demands, if Henry <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> marry Richard and Alice and announce Richard as his recognised heir. Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor. Henry remained silent and Richard then publicly changed sides at the conference and gave formal homage to Philip {{in front of the}} assembled nobles.|$|E

5|$|With the NIE reports {{suggesting}} {{the existence of}} the gap Gaither predicted, near panic broke out in military circles. In response, the US began to rush its own ICBM efforts, centered on the SM-65 Atlas. These missiles would be less susceptible to attack by Soviet ICBMs than their existing bomber fleet, especially in future versions which would be launched from underground silos. But even as Atlas was rushed, it appeared there would be a missile gap; NIE estimates made during the late 1950s suggested the Soviets would have significantly more ICBMs than the US between 1959 and 1963, at which point US production <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> catch up.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue Subway, {{and as part}} of the line's construction, the BMT side of {{the station}} <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> be used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white wall tiles were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's false ceiling was removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side of the station. On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half of the station. Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service. Many passengers now take advantage of the cross-platform transfer available between the F and the Q.|$|E
5|$|In November, Fowler {{travelled}} to Frankfurt, Germany to see Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, {{a specialist}} sports injuries doctor, {{to try and}} resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds. The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on 15 December as a late substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Bristol City. However {{he went on to}} suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain Darren Purse left him with damaged ankle ligaments. Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans for him to go to Colorado, United States to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> resolve the problem.|$|E

5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense {{for the use of}} the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the fault of the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.|$|E
5|$|Sienkiewicz {{was born}} on 5 May 1846 in Wola Okrzejska, now a village in {{the central part of}} eastern Polish region of Lubelskie, then part of the Russian Empire. His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side {{deriving}} from Tatars who had settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His parents were Józef Sienkiewicz (1813–96) and Stefania, née Cieciszowska (1820–73). He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (died during January Uprising), and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria. His family were entitled to use the Polish Oszyk coat of arms. Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska. His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in Grabowce Górne, Wężyczyn and Burzec. In September 1858 he began his education in Warsaw, where the family <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house (kamienica) in eastern Warsaw's Praga district. He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.|$|E
50|$|Turkey's power <b>would</b> be <b>finally</b> broken, and the Balkans {{would become}} the sphere of {{influence}} of the double headed eagle empires of Austria and Russia (both states had adopted the double headed emblem of the Byzantine Empire {{the symbol of the}} last Byzantine dynasty, the Palaiologos).|$|R
50|$|Georgetowns December 3, 1994, {{victory over}} DePaul began a 14-game Hoya winning streak against the Blue Demons {{over the next}} 20 years.

50|$|After {{defeating}} King Booker at Survivor Series, Batista {{would go}} on to hold the World title for four months, defending it against Mr. Kennedy at the 2007 Royal Rumble.

5|$|The North Circular Road {{ceased to}} be a trunk road in 2000, when control of all roads inside Greater London passed to Transport for London (TfL). In 2004, Mayor of London Ken Livingstone promised limited {{improvements}} to the road, but received criticism for not approving earlier plans for widening the often heavily congested road at critical sections. In 2009, it was announced that major works between the Bounds Green Road and Green Lanes junctions <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> go ahead, having been proposed for over 90 years, and was completed the following year. The work improved the carriageway between these junctions, widening Telford Road to two lanes and improving all of the junctions along the route. Improvements were also made to walkways and cycle paths along this route. However, unlike elsewhere on the North Circular, the new junctions are not grade-separated and have been designed with environmental concerns in mind. The opened scheme is a reduced specification from 1960s plans, which projected this section of the North Circular to be dual carriageway.|$|E
5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E
5|$|Nasri {{began the}} 2006–07 season playing under Albert Emon, his fourth {{different}} manager in three years. Despite this, Marseille's now heightened popularity saw increased speculation from writers and supporters that the club <b>would</b> <b>finally</b> win its first league title since the 1991–92 season. Nasri began the season on a quick note scoring the second {{goal in the}} team's 3–1 win over Paris Saint-Germain in September 2006. On 29 April 2007, Nasri scored a goal in Marseille's 4–2 hammering of Sochaux. Marseille were due to face the same club in the 2007 Coupe de France Final just days later and were, subsequently, heavy favorites {{as a result of}} the team's two-goal victory in the previous match. However, Sochaux recorded an upset victory defeating Marseille 5–4 on penalties after the match ended 2–2 following extra time. On the final match day of the season, Nasri converted the only goal in a 1–0 win over Sedan. The victory secured 2nd place for Marseille and was the club's best finish since finishing runner-up to Bordeaux in the 1998–99 season. Nasri finished the season with a career-high 50 appearances, 37 of them in the league. For his efforts, he was awarded the UNFP Young Player of the Year award and named to the Team of the Year. Nasri was also voted the Club Player of the Year by supporters, receiving 62% of the votes ahead of the likes of Ribéry and Niang.|$|E
