5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
