There exists a shadow of doubt, at least of that hesitation which shows that in spite of vows the woman knows that a change may come, and that provision for such possible steps backward should always be within her reach. But Lily had cast all such caution to the winds. She had given herself to the man entirely, and had determined that she would sink or swim, stand or fall, live or die, by him and by his truth. He had been as false as hell. She had been in his arms, clinging to him, kissing him, swearing that her only pleasure in the world was to be with him,--with him her treasure, her promised husband; and within a month, a week, he had been false to her. There had come upon her crushing tidings, and she had for days wondered at herself that they had not killed her. But she had lived, and had forgiven him.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} scale process developed by Navarro [Navarro, 2001] {{for the production}} of pyroelectric ceramics was used as a case study for the design of a high-level methodology for the scale-up of ceramic processes. A twofold approach was adopted as the basis of the methodology to perform the process scale-up. A "process focussed" approach was used that considered the sequence of processing operations, their feasibility on a larger scale and the potential problems foreseeable for a scaled-up process. Secondly, a "product focussed" approach analysed the quality of the product in respect to the customer requirements (the specifications). This approach also concerned the analysis of the process potential to perform within an essential tolerance interval. This aim was pursued {{through the use of a}} statistical technique, the Statistical Process Control. With the product focussed approach, the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the wafers obtained with the {{laboratory scale}} process were compared with the industrial requirements. The ceramic wafers possessed satisfactory characteristics except for their strength. The processing parameters were investigated in order to optimise the sintered ceramic microstructure and to understand their relative influence on the achievement of adequate characteristics for allowing handling and machining. Sintered density and grain size were studied as functions of green density and firing temperature. Increasing the green density from the original 37 % to approximately 65 % of the theoretical density by means of <b>warm</b> <b>pressing</b> allowed the wafers to achieve a more homogeneous microstructure and a higher sintered density up to approximately 97 % of the theoretical. Thanks to the increase in green density, the sintering temperature could be reduced by 100 °C and the total sintering time was shortened by 190 minutes. The samples produced with <b>warm</b> <b>pressing</b> were more resistant as 75 % of them survived during the poling and machining test, in contrast with the 5 % of the original samples. The suitability of the <b>warm</b> <b>pressing</b> technique to increase the green density up to 5 g. cm 3 (61 % of the theoretical density) was investigated by means of the statistical process control tool. A correct design of the press equipment was judged the most relevant factor for determining the control and the capability of the process. A rheological study was directed to understand how the slurry ingredients influenced the ceramic suspension, the green tape density and morphology. Two preparation routes were compared in order to discriminate among the effects induced by the electrosteric dispersant and the polyvinyl alcohol binder on the PZT particles suspension. It was shown how the dispersant influenced both the suspension characteristics and the comminution efficiency of the milling. The binder was shown to adsorb onto the ceramic particles. A model was proposed describing the interaction among ingredients which suggested that the adsorbing polymer induced particles flocculation by bridging mechanism, especially when added to stabilised slurries. As a result, PVA was judged inappropriate for tape casting of this PZT powder as it yielded low green density tapes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Homogeneous spherical alumina-polypropylene (PP) composite powder agglomerates with an average size of ~ 70 µm are synthesized by the non-solvent immersion phase separation technique. Polypropylene and submicrometer alumina are added to p-xylene and heated to 135 °C to form a homogeneous alumina particle suspension in a solution of polypropylene in p-xylene. Upon adding ethanol as a non-solvent, spherical PP-Al 2 O 3 agglomerates are precipitated which are suitable for conventional roller deposition. Green component parts with a density of 40 - 50 % can be produced by selective laser melting (SLM) of the polymer under optimized laser power, scan speed, scan spacing and powder preheating temperature. Various post-processing techniques like squeeze suspension infiltration (SI), <b>warm</b> isostatic <b>pressing</b> (WIPing) {{or a combination of}} both can be applied to increase the green density of the SLM parts.

WIPing of the green SLM parts at 100 °C and 64 MPa allows raising the sintered density up to 65 % TD, but results in internal cracks upon polymer debinding and sintering.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM; aka 3 D printing) has {{the potential}} to rapidly shape parts with an almost unlimited shape freedom. Variants of the following powder metallurgy (PM) process route, which includes additive manufacturing as a shaping step, were explored to produce ceramic parts: (i) powder synthesis, (ii) additive manufacturing, (iii) binder removal, (iv) furnace sintering and alternative post-SLS densification steps. In this study, alumina (Al 2 O 3) parts were produced, since Al 2 O 3 is currently the most commonly used ceramic material for technical applications. For the production of the alumina parts, indirect Selective Laser Sintering (indirect SLS) was used as the AM method during the shaping step. To explore indirect SLS, different powders, with a particle/agglomerate size of about 10 - 100 µm and consisting of a 0. 3 µm alumina powder and a polymer binder phase (i. e. composite alumina-binder agglomerates), were irradiated by a laser beam. Five different alumina-binder agglomerates were investigated: alumina-polyamide agglomerates produced through ball milling, alumina-polystyrene powder produced through dispersion polymerization and alumina-polyamide, alumina-polypropylene and alumina-carnauba_wax-low_density_polyethylene powders produced through temperature induced phase separation. During subsequent SLS, the laser irradiation, which melted only the binder phase, selectively consolidated the powder agglomerates layer by layer. After subsequent binder removal and furnace sintering, alumina parts, containing inter-agglomerate pores, were obtained. In order to reduce the inter-agglomerate voids, the possibility to include the following steps into the PM process chain was explored: (i) irradiating the powder layers multiple times instead of only once (i. e. laser re-melting), (ii) cold, quasi and <b>warm</b> isostatic <b>pressing</b> the SLSed parts and (iii) infiltrating the parts obtained at different stages of the PM process.

It was demonstrated that the right combination of temperature, high hydrostatic pressure and plastic shear deformation permits consolidation of the powder mixture to maximum green densities of 99. 26 %. Moreover, after direct compaction of blended elemental powders by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) with back pressure, the sintering temperature required for chemical and microstructural homogenisation of the compacts could be reduced by 150 - 250 °C. This was possible due to high green density, increased contact area between powder particles and the formation of fast diffusion paths associated with grain refinement by severe plastic deformation. The sintered Ti- 6 Al- 4 V billets exhibited a maximum density of 99. 88 %, Vickers hardness of 409 - 445 HV 1 and ultimate tensile strength in the range of 1000 - 1080 MPa. In contrast to findings of other authors, the use of TiH 2 powders in conjunction with ECAP processing did not bring any benefits with regard to the production of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy...|$|R

This time we were going to progress by means of the humble but useful donkey, of which we had collected no less than a dozen, to carry our goods and chattels, and, if necessary, ourselves. We had now but two Wakwafis left for servants, and found it quite impossible to get other natives to venture with us into the unknown parts we proposed to explore -- and small blame to them. After all, as Mr Mackenzie said, it was odd that three men, each of whom possessed many of those things that are supposed to make life worth living -- health, sufficient means, and position, etc. -- should from their own pleasure start out upon a wild-goose chase, from which the chances were they never would return. But then that is what Englishmen are, adventurers to the backbone; and all our magnificent muster-roll of colonies, each of which will in time become a great nation, testify to the extraordinary value of the spirit of adventure which at first sight looks like a mild form of lunacy. 'Adventurer' -- he that goes out to meet whatever may come. Well, that is what we all do in the world one way or another, and, speaking for myself, I am proud of the title, because it implies a brave heart and a trust in Providence. Besides, when many and many a noted Croesus, at whose feet the people worship, and many and many a time-serving and word-coining politician are forgotten, the names of those grand-hearted old adventurers who have made England what she is, will be remembered and taught with love and pride to little children whose unshaped spirits yet slumber in the womb of centuries to be. Not that we three can expect to be numbered with such as these, yet have we done something -- enough, perhaps, to throw a garment over the nakedness of our folly.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Socially {{responsible}} investment (SRI) engagement currently {{performs a}} variety of supportive regulatory functions such as reframing norms, establishing dialogue and providing resources to improve performance, however corporate responses are voluntary. This chapter will examine the potential gains in effectiveness for SRI engagement in a responsive regulatory regime. Approach: Global <b>warming</b> is a <b>pressing</b> environmental, social and governance (ESG) issue. By using the example of climate change the effectiveness of SRI engagement actors and the regulatory context can be considered. This chapter builds the conceptual framework for responsive regulation of climate change. Findings: SRI engagement may face resistance from corporations due to its voluntary nature and conflict with other goals. Legitimacy and accountability limit the effectiveness of SRI engagement functioning as a voluntary regulatory mechanism. This chapter argues that the effectiveness of SRI engagement on climate change could be enhanced if it served {{as part of a}} responsive regulation regime. Practical implications: Engagement is used by SRIs for ESG issues. A comprehensive regulatory regime could enhance corporate adaptation to climate change through increasing compliance with SRI engagement. The implication for SRI practitioners is that lobbying for a supportive regulatory regime has a large potential benefit. Social implications: Responsive regulatory policy involves both support and sanctions to improve compliance, enhancing policy efficiency and effectiveness. There are potentially large net social benefits from utilising SRI engagement in a regulatory regime. Originality of chapter: In seeking to re-articulate voluntary and legal approaches this research addresses a gap in the literature on climate change regulation...|$|R
