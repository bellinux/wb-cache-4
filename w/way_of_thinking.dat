5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical anarchist interpretation, others have {{analysed}} the character as a Marxist (opposite to Batman's capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom. The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> while eliminating any that oppose him. In The Killing Joke, the Joker is an abused member of the underclass who is driven insane by failings of the social system. The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in Batman #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham's wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison. Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able to triumph through his own innovations.|$|E
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviving}} the Sacred Beasts, the hatred is purged, but the racial tensions remain. Veigue begins to have difficulty {{in dealing with}} Claire's condition, and his cold attitude causes her to leave with Milhaust. Eventually, Veigue opens up {{to the rest of}} the group and overcomes his difficulties. As the continuing negative feelings of Karegia's population are starting to damage the world, the group decide to revive Georgyas again and bring him round to their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> At Geyorkias' resting place, Zilva appears and reveals herself as the mastermind behind the incidents, declaring that she will use Geyorkias to destroy the Humas and create a Gajuma-ruled kingdom. After her defeat, the party revive Geyorkias: he in turn reveals that the force influencing Zilva and spreading hatred was in fact Yuris, and that Yuris has become a threat to the world. The group travel to confront Yuris, but are initially sapped of strength by its negative emotions. The growing positive emotions of the people of Karegia as the racial disputes fade give them the strength to destroy Yuris' core. Agarte then recovers her Force, returns herself and Claire to their original bodies, and summons the Sacred Beasts to destroy Yuris. The effort costs Agarte her life, and she leaves Karegia in Milhaust's charge and reveals her love for him before dying. The group then go their separate ways to resolve the remaining conflicts in the land.|$|E

5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{specialized}} literature {{the issue}} of students’ mentality is analysed {{in relation to their}} attitudes. Some authors believe that the students’ attitude towards learning is influenced by the characteristics of the classroom environment (Fabunmi, 2007), or by students’ commitment and acceptance of tasks (Riaz, 2011). The paper aims at discussing Romanian students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about learning and the factors that influence them. It is based on experimental research conducted on a group of 200 subjects, all students from various faculties of “Dunărea de Jos” University of Galaţi, Romania. A questionnaire was prepared with the aim of determining the students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about learning. Among the methods of statistical assessment used, the following could be mentioned: frequency analysis, to illustrate the composition of the group of subjects; the calculation of the median for students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about learning as variables; Pearson's correlation coefficient, to verify the correlation among such variables as students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about learning, personal involvement factors, purpose, etc. Partial results seem to indicate the fact that students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about learning are influenced by such factors as: involvement, purpose, achievement, etc. Students react differently to school tasks: some lay stress on involvement for successful educational outcomes, while others believe that success can be achieved in other ways as well...|$|R
25|$|Madilog {{introduced}} a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of evidence and}} fact {{in a way that}} fit into Indonesian demographics and culture, in line with Indonesian thinking on fundamentals. Evidence is fact and fact is founded on scientific evidence. There are two main ways of thinking in Western philosophy. The first is idea (mind), unity of thinking, and sense. The second is matter as tangible reality, objective in nature as existence. Those two concepts were combined in the same <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> for human beings, who are the subject living things. In Madilog, the main field is evidence. Although evidence can't be described rationally, scientifically—as to what, why, and how—evidence should be considered as a true <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> the consequence of not thinking evidentially being logical fallacies and myth-making. This is the focus of the epistemology of Madilog, concerning truth, the validity of science, and the correlation of human knowledge to life. The epistemology is divided into three parts: definition, testing, and mathematical thinking.|$|E

40|$|Anticipating is {{the mental}} act of conceiving a certain {{expectation}} without performing {{a sequence of}} detailed operations {{to arrive at the}} expectation. This dissertation seeks to characterize students' problem-solving in terms of two types of anticipating acts: (a) foreseeing an action, which refers to the act of conceiving an expectation that leads to an action, prior to performing the operations associated with the action, and (b) predicting a result, which refers to the act of conceiving an expectation for the result of an event without actually performing the operations associated with the event. Harel's (in press) triad of determinants [...] mental act, <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding, and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> [...] is used to analyze students' acts of foreseeing and predicting. This research has three objectives: (a) to categorize students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> associated with foreseeing and predicting, (b) to identify the relationships between these <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding inequalities/equations, and (c) to explore the potential for advancing students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> associated with foreseeing/predicting. To accomplish these goals, fourteen 11 th enrolled in various mathematics courses were interviewed. Four of them participated in one-on-one teaching interventions. Non- directive tasks were used to elicit students' anticipatory behaviors. In this study, five <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> associated with foreseeing were identified: impulsive anticipation, tenacious anticipation, explorative anticipation, analytic anticipation, and interiorized anticipation. Three <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> associated with predicting were identified: association-based prediction, comparison-based prediction, and coordination-based prediction. In addition, five <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding inequalities/equations (I/E) were identified: I/E-as-a-signal-for-procedure, I/E-as-a-static -comparison, I/E-as-a-proposition, I/E-as-a-constraint, and I/E-as-a-comparison-of-functions. Students' <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> associated with foreseeing/predicting were found {{to be related to the}} quality of their solutions as well as the sophistication <b>of</b> their <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> understanding inequalities/equations. One learner's improvement was summarized in terms of the change in the sub-context (Cobb, 1985) in which she operated, from manipulating symbols in the pre interview to reasoning with symbols in the post- interview. Her operating in the sub-context of working with numbers helped her to achieve this transition. This finding underscores the importance of using numbers as a platform for algebra students to explore algebraic expressions and symbolic structure...|$|R
