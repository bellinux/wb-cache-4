5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E

25|$|The Congress of Samasamaja Youth Leagues and {{the other}} bodies {{affiliated}} to the party (membership of the party proper was still restricted to a small cadre, on a Leninist model) saw unprecedented growth at this time. The leadership looked to Salvador Allende's Chile {{as a model of}} revolution through parliamentary means. Leslie Goonewardene, easily the most cosmopolitan of the party's leaders, established contact with the 'Captains' of the Movement of the Armed Forces ('Movimento das Forças Armadas' - MFA) of Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of April 1974; he also became a theoretician of Eurocommunism and its application to Sri Lanka, writing a pamphlet 'Can <b>we</b> <b>Get</b> <b>To</b> Socialism This Way'.|$|E
25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll socialize with you and your significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. <b>We</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> do that with humans and Inhumans. <b>We</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> tackle those issues head-on without ever really talking about them." ...|$|E

When John Astin was cast he was best known for his {{portrayal of}} Gomez Addams in The Addams Family.

Harrison concluded his review while commenting on [...] "Callie and Her Sister": [...] "This sort of episode {{is still in its}} early stages, but I don't begrudge Ugly Americans the training wheels if it means <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> better know the people and creatures of the fascinating animated world.

However, Parkin criticised the other two campaigns, stating that Jake's campaign [...] "rarely delights" [...] while citing that Chris' was a [...] "second-rate third-person sprint" [...] with [...] "idiotic" [...] cutscene dialogue. A reviewer from Edge also felt that the campaigns noticeably contrasted in quality more than others. Similarly, Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot concluded that the game's campaigns were the ultimate test of patience for [...] "even the most dedicated", while Destructoid cited Resident Evil 6 as not only a [...] "step back" [...] for the series due to the game's new and unconventional features, but a [...] "step back for commonplace, unassuming action-shooters".|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching, was mixed towards [...] "Of Vice and Men", writing that the episode's {{focus on the}} mystery of the week did not work thematically, as Veronica did not have a stake in its solving.

[...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was very critical of the episode, naming five ways in which he thought Veronica was unlikable in the episode. [...] "Simply put, Veronica spends most of [...] "Of Vice and Men" [...] acting like she's better and smarter than everyone else. Of course, she is smarter than everyone, so that's okay. But better? Sometimes that's justified, sometimes it's not," [...] elaborating that Veronica became increasingly unlikeable in the episode. He was also negative towards the final sequence, writing [...] "it feels slightly manipulative," [...] commenting that the show was not ready to tackle scenes of attempted rape.|$|E
500|$|The menacing chords {{which played}} as Todd stalked and terrorized Nora in 1993 for {{mishandling}} his trial and sending him to prison were Todd's theme. There have been additional musical themes for Todd; for example, during his romance with Rebecca in 1994, an all-encompassing romantic theme with tragic nuances, {{which was at}} times intermixed with his ominous music, were heard. His rescue of Marty and two children from a car crash, and the Todd and Téa romance, also have their own musical themes. For the mid-1994 plot point where Todd rescues Marty and the children, the music was changed to reflect his decision {{to be a better}} person. It becomes his dominant theme, and is assisted by a tuneful, forward-moving melody. This music is primarily a part of Todd's 1994 redemption storyline and the storyline when he is the Lord heir in 1995. According to Nichtern, the music for Todd and Teá, which he composed with his friend keyboardist Kevin Bents, was [...] "as close as <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Todd 'romantic' music", with [...] "the possibility of a little sensuality and romance".|$|E

He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything.
