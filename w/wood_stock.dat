2500|$|According to the Chinese Wujing Zongyao {{military}} {{manuscript of}} 1044, the crossbow used en masse {{was the most}} effective weapon against northern nomadic cavalry charges. [...] Elite crossbowmen were also valued as long-range snipers {{as was the case}} when the Liao Dynasty general Xiao Talin was picked off by a Song crossbowman at the Battle of Shanzhou in 1004. [...] Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, {{such as the use of}} a mulberry <b>wood</b> <b>stock</b> and brass; a crossbow in 1068 could pierce a tree at 140 paces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideal working}} stock has {{the grain of}} the wood running {{parallel}} to the shaving horse, and perpendicular to the blade of the drawknife, so that the drawknife shaves away the entire wood fibre and does not cut against it. [...] It is best not pulled with blade perfectly perpendicular to the <b>wood</b> <b>stock,</b> but pulled slightly upward toward them in a skewed (blade at a slight diagonal) or slithering fashion, aiming not to take off as much wood as possible, but gradually [...] "shave" [...] the work. The operator gently levers the blade to [...] "bite" [...] into the wood and then controls the depth of the cut by raising or lowering the handles as they pull the drawknife towards them.|$|E

2500|$|The rifle served {{adequately}} {{during its}} brief {{tour of duty}} in Vietnam. Though it was unwieldy in the thick brush due to its length and weight, the power of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge allowed it to penetrate cover quite well and reach out to extended range, developing 2,560 ft·lbf (3,463 J) of muzzle energy. [...] However, there were several drawbacks to the M14. [...] The traditional <b>wood</b> <b>stock</b> of the rifle had a tendency to swell and expand in the heavy moisture of the jungle, adversely affecting accuracy. Fiberglass stocks were produced to resolve this problem, but the rifle was discontinued before very many could be distributed for field use. Also, because of the M14's powerful 7.62×51mm cartridge, the weapon was deemed virtually uncontrollable in fully automatic mode, so most M14s were permanently set to semi-automatic fire only to avoid wasting ammunition in combat.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to develop {{a deeper understanding of the}} interdependences between smallholder farming and the state of environmental management in rural Malawi. We examined the agricultural local governance framework in Malingunde Extension Planning Area (EPA), its contribution to food security and how it conflicts with overall land and forest resources management. The charcoal production process was discussed in line with its implications for agricultural production and environmental sustainability. The smallholder households employ inappropriate land management practices, engage in agricultural production on unsuitable land and use fertile soils, timber and firewood for brick production and construction and secondly engage in charcoal production (deforestation) as a coping mechanism against food deficiency. However, while detrimental in its own right, this environmental degradation in the area cannot be explicitly pinned to, for instance, the total charcoal supply being out of balance with <b>wood</b> <b>stocks</b> or insufficient land. It is, rather, usually due to failures to provide incentives to manage land and forest resources in a manner that allows regeneration of both the soils and <b>wood</b> <b>stocks</b> in the area. An improvement in the quality and quantity of the smallholder agriculture sector production would promote significantly the environmental management efforts...|$|R
