5000|$|I met {{somebody}} {{who had just been}} hired as a writer’s assistant on Colbert. She invited me to a taping and asked what was up. I told her this whole sob story ending with, “I was at the lowest point in my life,” and she said, “Oh well, you know that they’re hiring,” and then sort of didn’t say anything. And then a month later they hired me, although she did say after I got hired, “Yeah, give it a month and a half, you’ll be complaining just as much as you were before.” I think she really nailed the comedy writer mindset. On The Colbert Report Lesser has appeared as different characters, among them a drug lord, a conquistador, and Colbert's [...] "interview stunt beard." [...] During his send-off on the show, Colbert remarked that [...] "Around the office Frank was known for his intelligence, sensitivity, and his completely unproducible scripts. Seriously, Frank, <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get a hovercraft." [...] When asked about his experience writing for The Colbert Report, Lesser said: It’s wonderful when the person who’s in charge is a brilliantly talented, hilarious person.
