5|$|As {{plutonium}} was not available, it was substituted {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties. Depleted uranium was used {{but was not}} optimal because of its opacity for radiation; iron, copper, or cadmium were other choices. Cadmium was the choice {{for most of the}} tests. The first shot was performed <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> mockup of the plutonium pit.|$|E

5|$|In Albanian folklore, the dhampir is {{the hybrid}} {{child of the}} karkanxholl (a werewolf-like {{creature}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> mail shirt) or the lugat (a water-dwelling ghost or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression the dhampir knows the lugat. The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually {{the son of a}} lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.|$|E

5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E

5|$|He {{at first}} denied being {{anywhere}} near the Farm, then during interview four {{said he had been}} there and had thrown stones, and during interview five said he had been at the Tangmere block, but had played no role in the murder. During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Endara and {{his running}} mates, Ricardo Arias Calder√≥n and Guillermo Ford, led a {{contingent}} of a thousand supporters to protest the annulment of the elections and urge that the ADOC candidates be recognized as the winners. The protest was attacked by a detachment of Dignity Battalions, a paramilitary group supporting Noriega, and the three candidates were badly beaten. Endara was struck <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> club, leaving a gash on his head. He was briefly hospitalized and received eight stitches. Images of the attacks on Endara and Ford were carried by media around the world, and were credited with building public support in the US for the invasion that would soon follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} laid down on 5 May 1862 at the Royal Dockyard in Deptford, England, as the 17-gun sloop Circassian. She was renamed Enterprise in July 1862 and {{reclassified}} as an armoured corvette. Construction had barely begun {{before she was}} redesigned <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> upper hull as well as armoured sides and battery. The ship was launched on 9 February 1864, commissioned on 5 May 1864 and completed on 3 June 1864. She cost ¬£62,474 to build. Enterprise initially served with the Channel Fleet, but {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean Fleet where she remained until 1871 when she returned to England. She was refitted and rearmed at Malta in 1868. Upon her return the ship was paid off into 4th Class Reserve in August 1871 at Sheerness. Enterprise was sold for scrap in 1885 for ¬£2,072.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, apart from his devotion to the Sagrada Fam√≠lia, Gaud√≠ participated only in minor {{projects}} which were not completed: in 1916, on the death of his friend bishop Josep Torras i Bages, he designed a monument in his honour, which he wanted to place in front of the Passion facade of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia. He made a sketch of the project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaud√≠. It was put in the Sagrada Fam√≠lia, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936. Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellter√ßol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> structure flying the Catalan flag. The sketch of the project was done by Llu√≠s Bonet i Gar√≠, Gaud√≠'s assistant.|$|E

5|$|Gaud√≠ {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi G√ºell between 1884 and 1887, the G√ºell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now {{on the outskirts of}} Barcelona. G√ºell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarri√†, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuy√†s de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaud√≠ undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real C√°tedra Gaud√≠, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 895 the talented general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder was summoned to Constantinople and sent against the Bulgarians {{at the head of}} a large army. While Simeon concentrated his forces along the southern border to confront Phokas, the Byzantine navy under admiral Eustathios Argyros sailed to the Danube Delta to assist the Magyars. Believing that Simeon I would back off Leo VI sent an envoy, Constantinacios, to propose peace. Simeon I, who had studied in the University of Constantinople and was familiar with the Byzantine diplomacy, was suspicious of the Byzantine rapprochement, charged Constantinacios with espionage and put him into custody. The Danube was barred <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> chain to impede the movement of the Byzantine navy and the bulk of the army was dislocated northwards. The Byzantines, however, managed to break the chain and transported the Magyar hordes south of the river. The Magyars, led by √Årp√°d's son Li√ºntika, ravaged Dobrudzha and dealt a heavy defeat on the Bulgarian army, led personally by Simeon I. Simeon sought refuge in the strong fortress of Drastar while the Magyars pillaged and looted unopposed, reaching the outskirts of the capital Preslav. Before retreating north, the Magyars sold thousands of captives to the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, May 25, 1941, {{ground was}} broken for Mount St. Peter Church. The event was celebrated by the priests of St. Peter's {{congregation}} and about two thousand {{people showed up}} to watch. The cornerstone was blessed on Sunday, September 7, 1941, by Reverend Alfred Koch, who was the Arch Abbot of St. Vincent in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Many other priests from the area were also present. Father Paul Tomlinson of St. Peter's Church in Pittsburgh delivered the sermon in English and Archabbot Koch closed the ceremony with the Pontifical Benediction in Italian. The large red cornerstone was made of granite and was fitted <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> box.
