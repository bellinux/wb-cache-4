The entire city would become a test centre; this would require the installation of a major new digital infrastructure to enable communications between vehicles, with the roadway and with traffic signals.

25|$|The town has, {{in recent}} years, raised the {{possibility}} of paving it, saying it would be cheaper to maintain and silts up a paralleling brook through erosion. This has divided residents along Old Albany Post Road. Opponents point to its historic designation, character and rural charm, which would be lost if it were surfaced. Proponents, many near the road's southern end, cite public safety concerns such as inaccessibility for police and fire vehicles during washouts in heavy storms like the April 2007 Nor'easter, which left craters four feet (1.3 m) deep in front of some driveways. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has given the town a grant to repair it, although it has not been decided <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> used for pavement or not.|$|E
500|$|The {{formula for}} calitoxin is C203H305N55O72S7. It has a {{molecular}} mass of 4886 Daltons and an isoelectric point at pH 5.4. [...] The {{amino acid sequence}} is markedly dissimilar from other known sea anemones toxins. [...] There are two known genes coding for two highly homologous calitoxins—CLX-1 and CLX-2. [...] Both originate from a precursor peptide of 79 amino acids where the C-terminus determines <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the mature CLX-1 or CLX-2. [...] The activated toxins consist of 46 amino acids with three disulfide bonds. [...] Researchers suspect that the toxins are stored as precursors in cnidocytes. [...] Under the effects of some triggering stimulus, the precursor is modified and released in the active form. [...] The patterning of cleavage sites targeted during maturation of the peptide suggest that the active quaternary structure might be a tetrapeptide.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Lawrence John Wargrave, {{a retired}} judge, {{known as a}} [...] "hanging judge" [...] for liberally {{awarding}} {{the death penalty in}} murder cases. Wargrave is accused of influencing the jury to hand a guilty verdict to Edward Seton, a man many thought was innocent of his crime of killing an old woman, and sentencing him to death unfairly. However, as the two policemen discuss at Scotland Yard, new evidence after Seton's execution proved he was unmistakably guilty. He admits in his postscript that he has a lifelong hidden [...] urge to cause death, but felt bound only to indulge it with [...] persons, and a lifelong wish to create a masterpiece of a mystery. Finding himself terminally ill, he creates a game in which, as island owner [...] "U.N. Owen" [...] (i.e., [...] "Unknown"), he entices to an island various people who have been {{responsible for the deaths of}} other people, but escaped justice, through a third party agent, Isaac Morris, in order to be a murderer himself, and kill his [...] "guests" [...] in a way that would leave an almost-unsolvable mystery. After the deaths, he arranges the island so that each death appears to have a survivor. However out of what he admits is a [...] "pitiful human need" [...] for recognition, he also writes a confession, which he throws in the sea, and leaves to chance <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> found. His final act is to shoot himself in a way that matches the description of his death in some of the other guests' diaries, by using a rubber cord and handkerchief wrapped around the gun when he shoots himself in the head; the elastic will separate and attract no attention, and the gun and cloth will recoil a sufficient distance from him to avoid any suspicion of the true circumstances by the police.|$|E
2500|$|After her {{elimination}} from American Idol, Miller {{announced plans}} to launch a music career as soon as possible, {{as well as an}} eventual acting career. Of her intents for her debut studio album, Miller has revealed that she would like to write or co-write all material and intends to show all sides to her personality in an intricate and artistic manner which she feels current mainstream music largely lacks. She further explained, [...] "I want to have music that has meaning and is real. I don't want to have dance-party music, but at the same time, I don't want to put people to sleep. I want to incorporate the soulful piano sound with a lot of edge. I know the message that I want to send out, and I know the music I want to do. I can't wait to show it to people." [...] The top three finalists – Miller, Candice Glover and Harrison – recorded background vocals on a song for judge Mariah Carey's fourteenth studio album, though it is yet to be confirmed <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> on the final track listing. On May 17, 2013, subsequent to the series' finale, Miller released her debut single [...] "You Set Me Free" [...] to digital retailers via her American Idol contract with 19 Recordings. On May 22, 2013, reports surfaced that Miller had signed a publishing contract with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG), and is in midst of searching for a record deal. In June 2013, Miller confirmed she was co-writing with Toby Gad, Autumn Rowe, David Hodges, Adam Watts and his Red Decibel team and recording demos in Los Angeles, California through social media. Along with the remainder of the Top 11 from season twelve, Miller embarked on the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2013, where she showcased original music, from July to August 2013.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the connection between the performance gain that can be obtained by selftraining and the similarity between the corpora used in this approach. Self-training is a semi-supervised technique designed to increase the performance of machine learning algorithms by automatically classifying instances of a task and adding these as additional training material to the same classifier. In the context of language processing tasks, this training material is mostly an (annotated) corpus. Unfortunately self-training does not always lead to a performance increase and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>is</b> largely unpredictable.
