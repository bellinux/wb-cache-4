She enters in a room where there are pictures of her lover scattered across a table. These scenes are intercut with scenes of Lopez and her lover laying in a grass.

25|$|The {{conventional}} color descriptions {{are traditional}} in astronomy, and represent colors {{relative to the}} mean color of an A-class star, which {{is considered to be}} white. The apparent color descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or <b>with</b> <b>binoculars.</b> However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work.

A viewing point, the [...] "Window on Kella", was established on a nearby hilltop from which tourists could peer across the border <b>with</b> <b>binoculars</b> and telescopes.

500|$|The {{brightest}} {{member of}} this constellation is Aldebaran, an orange-hued, spectral class K5III giant star.

Forming the profile of a Bull's face is a V or K-shaped asterism of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the Hyades, the nearest distinct open star cluster after the Ursa Major Moving Group. In this profile, Aldebaran forms the bull's bloodshot eye, which has been described as [...] "glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion", a constellation that lies just to the southwest.

500|$|The {{band of the}} Milky Way {{goes through}} Canis Major, with only patchy obscurement by {{interstellar}} dust clouds. It is bright in the northeastern corner of the constellation, {{as well as in}} a triangular area between Adhara, Wezen and Aludra, with many stars visible in binoculars. Canis Major boasts several open clusters. The only Messier object is M41 (NGC 2287), an open cluster with a combined visual magnitude of 4.5, around 2300 light-years from Earth. Located 4 degrees south of Sirius, it contains contrasting blue, yellow and orange stars and covers an area the apparent size of the full moon—in reality around 25 light-years in diameter. Its most luminous stars have already evolved into giants. The brightest is a 6.3-magnitude star of spectral type K3. Located in the field is 12 Canis Majoris, though this star is only 670 light-years distant. NGC 2360, known as Caroline's Cluster after its discoverer Caroline Herschel, is an open cluster located 3.5 degrees west of Muliphein and has a combined apparent magnitude of 7.2. Around 15 light-years in diameter, it is located 3700 light-years away from Earth, and has been dated to around 2.2 billion years old. NGC 2362 is a small, compact open cluster, 5200 light-years from Earth. It contains about 60 stars, of which Tau Canis Majoris is the brightest member. Located around 3 degrees northeast of Wezen, it covers an area around 12 light-years in diameter, though the stars appear huddled around Tau when seen through binoculars. It is a very young open cluster as its member stars are only a few million years old.
