5|$|Beetle remains bearing <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{marks of}} bird attacks {{have been found}} by the River Ouse and {{hardened}} adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also {{been found in the}} webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|In late October 2010, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{began to}} monitor a weak area of disorganized weather along the {{southern}} periphery of a frontal system, associated with a broad surface trough east-northeast of Puerto Rico. Supported by an upper-level low retrograding to its southwest, the system generated clusters of scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms, otherwise known as convection. The activity gradually enhanced as environmental conditions within its encounter became more favorable over time. Around 1200UTC October28, satellite imagery showed <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> formation of a surface low within the trough. Shower and thunderstorm activity accordingly intensified, and the NHC assessed a high chance for tropical or subtropical development. At the time, the center of circulation remained poor; however, it became better defined later that day, with a stable amount of corresponding convection. Although the upper low had remained adjacent, it was located well to the southwest of the system's small wind radius, an atypical structure for a subtropical cyclone. The system was therefore operationally designated as Tropical Storm Shary at 0000UTC October 29, though post-season analysis revealed a tropical depression had formed by 1800 UTC October 28, about 520mi (830km) south-southeast of Bermuda. At the time of classification, the agency noted that Shary would be a relatively short-lived tropical cyclone due to a merge with a cold front forecast to occur within the following 48 hours.|$|E

5|$|Late in {{the morning}} of November 22, 1952, Loring led a flight of four F-80s on patrol over Kunwha. Upon radioing a forward air controller, he was told a T-6 Texan flying over Sniper Ridge had spotted a {{concentration}} of artillery near the ridge which was pinning down UN ground troops on the ridge. He was also told the artillery concentration was surrounded by a heavy presence of anti-aircraft guns. Loring ordered the flight to the location, spotting the artillery concentration. Immediately after Loring began his dive bombing run, he was spotted by the anti-aircraft batteries. The Chinese crews operating them were highly skilled, and even at a distance, the batteries fired an extremely accurate barrage which struck Loring's aircraft several times on the nose and fuselage. The fire disabled the aircraft. His wingmen, noting the damage, suggested he abort the bombing mission, as the flight was not far behind the lines and Loring's aircraft could have attempted the return trip. Instead, Loring ceased radio contact, and resumed <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> standard bombing mission. At , however, Loring accelerated his aircraft at a 40-degree angle {{in what appeared to be}} a controlled maneuver, lining up the Chinese batteries. The other pilots reported they watched, stunned, as Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the battery position. Loring was killed instantly in the impact, but his action resulted in the complete destruction of the battery position.|$|E

The fire alarm for the port engine sounded, and the crew performed fire drills on both engines. One female passenger injured her leg. The wrecked aircraft was initially stored but was later declared as damaged beyond economic repair and was subsequently scrapped.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 Smith et al. {{expanded}} {{on these}} results by barcoding 2,134 flies belonging to <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> 16 most generalist of the ACG tachinid morphospecies. They encountered 73 mitochondrial lineages separated {{by an average}} of 4% sequence divergence and, as these lineages are supported by collateral ecological information, and, where tested, by independent nuclear markers (28S and ITS1), the authors therefore viewed these lineages as provisional species. Each of the 16 initially apparent generalist species were categorized into one of four patterns: (i) a single generalist species, (ii) a pair of morphologically cryptic generalist species, (iii) a complex of specialist species plus a generalist, or (iv) a complex of specialists with no remaining generalist. In sum, there remained 9 generalist species classified among the 73 mitochondrial lineages analyzed.|$|E
25|$|In the Eastern Conference Finals, a {{match up}} with the 61-win, Carlisle-led Pacers, the Pistons faltered in the final 90 seconds of Game 1, falling 78-74. Prior to Game 2, Rasheed Wallace famously {{guaranteed}} a Detroit victory. With Detroit clinging to a 69-67 lead with under 30 seconds to play, after Billups recovered the basketball after a Jermaine O'Neal blocked shot of Rasheed Wallace, Jamaal Tinsley stripped Billups and found Reggie Miller open down the court for <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> tying lay-up. As Miller approached the basket, Tayshaun Prince ran in from the left wing and blocked Miller's lay-up as it left his fingertips. Richard Hamilton recovered the loose ball before it went out of bounds and was fouled by Tinsley. Hamilton would make three free throws in the game's final 15 seconds to seal the victory and tie the series. The Pistons rode the momentum of Game 2 (including dominant wins in Games 3 and 5) to a 4-2 series victory, advancing to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in 14 years.|$|E
25|$|Thompson was {{to provide}} Rolling Stone with {{coverage}} for the 1976 presidential campaign that would appear in a book published by the magazine. Reportedly, as Thompson was waiting for a $75,000 advance check to arrive, he learned that Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner had cancelled the assignment without informing him. Wenner then asked Thompson to travel to Vietnam to report on <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> closing of the Vietnam War. Thompson accepted, and left for Saigon immediately. He arrived with the country in chaos, just as South Vietnam was collapsing and other journalists were scrambling to find transportation out of the region. While there, Thompson learned that Wenner had {{pulled the plug on}} this excursion as well, and Thompson found himself in Vietnam without health insurance or additional financial support. Thompson's story about the fall of Saigon would not be published in Rolling Stone until ten years later. These two incidents severely strained the relationship between the author and the magazine, and Thompson contributed far less to the publication in later years.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they did}} not {{immediately}} announce that they suspected foul play, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began to investigate the unusual and high-profile case by the day after Jackson's death. By August 28, the LAPD had announced that the case would be referred to prosecutors who might file criminal charges. Because the LAPD did not secure Jackson's home and allowed the Jackson family access to it too before returning to remove certain items, the department raised concerns by some observers that the chain of custody had been broken. The police maintained that they had followed protocol. On July 1, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) joined the LAPD in the investigation. Having the authority to investigate issues otherwise protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, the DEA could legally follow the entirety of <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> complex trail of prescription drugs supplied to Jackson. California Attorney General Jerry Brown announced that his office was helping the LAPD and DEA to create a statewide database of all medical doctors and prescriptions filled.|$|E

An hour later, after a rain-lengthened lunch break, Malcolm uprooted Taylor's off stump for 113 and the intent to chase was quelled. Boon batted for an hour and three-quarters for 17, but after his dismissal Fraser (5–73) made the most of the damp conditions, delivering a series of seaming deliveries to the Australian middle order that saw Bevan, both Waugh brothers and Healy returned to the pavilion, Rhodes taking three catches. The fading light saw Hick, Tufnell and Gooch bowling at this critical time instead of Gough and Malcolm, with Warne and May batting out the last hour to save the draw, Malcolm spilled a catch from Warne off <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> final delivery of the match and the players walked off thinking the game was over, only to realise {{by the time they got}} to the pitch edge that there was still time for one more over.|$|E

500|$|Wadsworth {{made her}} fourth depth charge {{attack on a}} U-boat on 29July. At about 17:25, she dropped several charges in <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> wake of a {{submarine}} proceeding submerged. The conjecture that a U-boat was damaged {{was supported by the}} appearance of a large amount of heavy oil on the surface following the attack. Just before 23:00, the warship attacked another supposed submarine wake. It was too dark to evaluate the results; but, not long thereafter, [...] struck a submerged metallic object which caused her to list 10° temporarily. Later, Wadsworths wireless operator intercepted messages sent by a German submarine over a period of about half an hour which suggested that Wadsworth may have damaged a submarine, although as with the depth-charge attack of 21June, no definite proof was forthcoming. Early in August, the destroyer concluded her summer of peak activity by escorting the first United States merchant convoy on the last leg of its voyage to Europe. During the mission, on the 16th, the destroyer dropped a barrage on what was thought to be a submarine.|$|E

500|$|Number Ones was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics. William Ruhlmann, {{a writer for}} Allmusic, stated that watching the videos in order made him 'experience' Jackson's changing appearance over the year; noting things such as Jackson's skin becoming lighter (a result of his Vitiligo). Ruhlmann commented that seeing Jackson's changing appearance, {{as well as the}} videos itself helped him understand Jackson's career more, commenting, [...] "Number Ones was released at <b>what</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of Michael Jackson's long, troubled reign as a pop star, and it contained many clues to both his success and his downfall." [...] Ruhlmann further noted that [...] "a messianic theme ran through many of the videos" [...] like the relatively modest [...] "Beat It," [...] which is about stopping violence, to [...] "Earth Song," [...] in which Jackson restored ravaged rain forests and even brought the dead back to life. Dan LeLuca of the Philadelphia Inquirer described Number Ones as being a [...] "reminder" [...] of the [...] "MTV era".
