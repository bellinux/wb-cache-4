5|$|Thanks to {{its status}} as a {{first-class}} fortification, Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice.

Almost immediately, Corbally sought to raise capital to fund construction and programs at what was then the ninth-largest university system in the country, especially focusing on the Chicago campus and the school's veterinary medicine and agriculture programs. Corbally enlisted the help of alumni from these programs to raise money for two new buildings on the Urbana-Champaign campus.|$|E
5|$|Effusive eruptions on {{the main}} island {{returned}} on 19 August 1966, <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24cumi), and the island's highest point was 174metres (570ft) above sea level at that time.|$|E

5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just {{enough to keep the}} breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war, and along <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E
5|$|In Antananarivo and {{throughout}} the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs {{five to seven years}} after the death of a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's lamba-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends and neighbors are invited {{to take part in the}} music, dancing and feasting that accompanies the event. The famadihana is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Plum cakes made <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> plums {{came with}} other {{migrants}} from other traditions in which plum cake is prepared using plum {{as a primary}} ingredient.

Plum cake prepared with plums is {{also a part of}} Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, and is referred to as Pflaumenkuchen or Zwetschgenkuchen. Other plum-based cakes are found in French, Italian and Polish cooking.|$|E

5|$|Since 1970, I-205 {{has seen}} few changes.

As of Summer 2009, I-205 has been widened to six lanes (three in each direction) for its entire route.

5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{panic in}} Polish ranks convinced Muraviev to renew his assault <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> forces, despite the losses his columns had suffered. Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 {{from the north}} and captured a brickyard and yet another fortified inn, the Karczma Żelazna directly to its rear. Its garrison offered only light resistance before retreating in disarray. The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of {{a large part of the}} second line of Polish defences.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} {{volume is}} commonly quoted {{in most countries}} using the metric system. This information is required by ISO13769 to be stamped on the cylinder shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> water. This {{has resulted in the}} term 'water capacity', abbreviated as WC which is often stamp marked on the cylinder shoulder. It's almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief of}} the {{garrison}} and replacement <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> troops were finally agreed. The first stage saw the 1st Polish Carpathian Brigade replace the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade. Next came the 6th Infantry Division's 16th Infantry Brigade, during late September, with {{elements of the}} 32nd Army Tank Brigade, {{in lieu of the}} 24th Australian Infantry Brigade. On 10October, for security reasons and in an attempt to confuse Axis intelligence as to when the division was fully redeployed, the 6th Infantry Division was renamed the 70th Infantry Division. Major-General Ronald Scobie was given command.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{antelope}} prefers areas <b>with</b> <b>fresh</b> {{and dense}} growth of shrubs and other plants.

The animal's habitat also includes forest fringes and secondary forests. Its geographic range extends eastward from the Kounounkan Massif in southwestern Guinea through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire to the Volta River in Ghana. The royal antelope may {{also be found in}} the region north to the forested areas of western Africa, which is marked by the interface of forest and savannah habitats.|$|E
