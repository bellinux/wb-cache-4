5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{may also}} occur during a gradual dosage reduction, but are {{typically}} less severe and may persist {{as part of}} a protracted <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> for months after cessation of benzodiazepines. Approximately 10% of patients experience a notable protracted <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which can persist for many months or in some cases a year or longer. Protracted symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a sub-acute level of severity. Such symptoms do gradually lessen over time, eventually disappearing altogether.|$|E
40|$|Drug <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{reportedly}} {{have been}} caused by numerous pharmacological agents, but only a few drugs have been adequately studied in this regard. Criteria for evaluating drug <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> have been proposed. Sedative-hypnotic agents, opiates, corticosteroids, clonidine, tricyclic antidepressant medications and beta-adrenergic blocking agents meet the criteria for such syndromes. Gradual tapering of the dose of these drugs is recommended when therapy must be discontinued. Whether or not other drugs cause rebound reactions is questionable, but caution should be used when discontinuing drugs for which numerous reports of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> exist...|$|R
30|$|Although {{primarily}} a sedative agent, dexmedetomidine is a selective α 2 -adrenergic agent with rapid {{onset of action}} and easy titration, which could contribute to the control of hypertension in <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> [70].|$|R
50|$|Drug {{discontinuation}} {{may cause}} rebound effects (return {{of the symptoms}} the drug relieved, and that, to a degree stronger {{than they were before}} treatment first began) and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> (symptoms caused by the discontinuation by the drug itself).|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} {{choice in the}} management of alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe delirium. Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> can occur. Therefore, preventing a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam {{should not be used}} for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.|$|E
40|$|Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} compound of the lactones group, undergoing biotransformation into gamma-hydroxybutyrate after the intake (GHB). Because of the easy access, low price and fast psychotropic effect, GBL {{is becoming increasingly}} popular substance having intoxicating effect. Taking of GBL causes dose-dependent euphoric, sedative, hypnotic effects. Its use can quickly lead to physical dependence with severe course of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms resemble those occurring {{in the course of}} addiction to alcohol or benzodiazepines. In some patients, delirium develops during substance withdrawal. There are described severe, life-threatening complications in the course of delirium in GBL-dependent patients. The management of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> and delirium mainly involves administration of benzodiazepines. In this paper, we present a case of delirium in 24 -year-old man addicted to GBL hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. Delirium in this patient went without complications and was successfully managed with diazepam and lorazepam...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect is mild {{drowsiness}} at initial dosing. It is {{not associated with}} any <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> or dependence, and is not scheduled in France. In conclusion, etifoxine shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> than those of benzodiazepines Etifoxine for Pain Patients with Anxiety A recent (2012) review of etifoxine by the French National Pharmacovigilance Committee determined that etifoxine was safe and continued to provide a favorable alternative to benzodiazepine anxiolytics. Contrary to comments in non-refereed on line journals, the committee found that (for a ten year pharmacovigilance period) that safety concerns were rare or very rare and {{that the incidence of}} idiosyncratic hepatic problems were very rare (less than drugs like Lipitor).http://ansm.sante.fr/var/ansm_site/storage/original/application/56a2e1cb1dbc986720da09842df11c22.pdf ...|$|R
50|$|The use of opioid {{medication}} {{in management}} of CH {{is not recommended}} and may make headache syndromes worse. Long-term opioid use is associated with well known dependency, addiction and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Prescription of opioid medication may additionally lead to further delay in differential diagnosis, undertreatment, and mismanagement.|$|R
5|$|Side {{effects can}} include a {{decrease}} in efforts to breathe, low blood pressure, and sleepiness. Tolerance to its effects and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> may occur following long-term use. Paradoxical effects, such as increased activity, can occur especially in children and older people. There is evidence of risk when used during pregnancy but no evidence of harm with a single dose during breastfeeding. It is of the benzodiazepine class and works through the GABA neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
2500|$|Acute {{morphine}} withdrawal, {{along with}} {{that of any other}} opioid, proceeds through a number of stages. Other opioids differ in the intensity and length of each, and weak opioids and mixed agonist-antagonists may have acute <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> that do not reach the highest level. As commonly cited, they are: ...|$|R
50|$|Common {{causes of}} visual {{hallucination}} include Neurologic disorders, Migraine, Epilepsy, Hemispheric lesions, Optic nerve disorders, Brain stem lesions, Narcolepsy, Ophthalmologic diseases (such as Glaucoma, Retinal disease, Enucleation, Cataract formation, Choroidal disorder, Macular abnormalities), Toxic and metabolic conditions, Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, Drug and alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes,</b> Hallucinogens, Schizophrenia, Affective disorders, Conversion disorders, Sensory deprivation, Sleep deprivation, Hypnosis, Intense emotional experiences.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} {{occur in}} a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including toxic disturbances, drug <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes,</b> focal central nervous system lesions, migraine headaches, blindness, schizophrenia, and psychotic mood disorders. Visual hallucinations are generally assumed to characteristically reflect organic disorders and are very rare in affective disorders. Here, we present a case of visual hallucinations in a young female with bipolar illness during the manic phase...|$|R
5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
40|$|Delirium tremens {{represents}} {{the most severe}} {{end of the spectrum}} of alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> and has a substantial mortality if not adequately treated. Concomitant sepsis, fluid and electrolyte disturbances and recent trauma or surgery are significant risk factors for its development. Genetic factors predisposing to its development have been identified recently and include cholecystokinin gene and [mu] opioid receptor mutations. Effective treatment is based on early recognition and effective sedation with benzodiazepines, together with attention to concomitant illnesses...|$|R
5000|$|Pentobarbital {{is used as}} a {{hypnotic}} when analgesia is not required. It´s {{often used}} in CT imaging when sedation is needed. It is efficient, safe and the recovery time is short. [...] In 2013 the barbiturates phenobarbital and butabarbital are still used as sedatives in certain cases as well as to antagonize the effects of drugs as ephedrine and theophylline. Phenobarbital is used in cases of drug <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes.</b> It is used as normal and emergency treatment in some cases of epilepsy.|$|R
30|$|Systolic blood {{pressure}} {{of more than}} 180  mmHg or pressure change greater than 20 % during SBT is among the criteria of clinical intolerance and indicators of weaning failure [35]. The etiology of the increased {{blood pressure}} during a SBT is most likely multivariable in origin, mainly triggered by hypoxemia, hypercapnia and enhanced sympathetic activity [6, 27]. Additionally, pain, anxiety and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes,</b> usually from opioid use, are also responsible. Therefore, any antihypertensive therapy should be given only after exclusion of these reversible factors.|$|R
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|Suffering <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{from the}} lack of cable, Peter straps a television-sized {{cardboard}} cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

25|$|Animal {{studies have}} found that glutamergic changes as a result of {{benzodiazepine}} use are responsible for a delayed <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which in mice peaks 3 days after cessation of benzodiazepines. This was demonstrated by the ability to avoid the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> by the administration of AMPA antagonists. It is believed that different glutamate subreceptors, e.g., NMDA and AMPA, are responsible for different stages/time points of the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome.</b> NMDA receptors are upregulated in the brain as a result of benzodiazepine tolerance. AMPA receptors are also involved in benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal. A decrease in benzodiazepine binding sites in the brain may also occur as part of benzodiazepine tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} that may present similarly include benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndrome</b> (a condition also {{mainly caused by}} GABAA receptor adaptation).|$|E
40|$|Abstinence {{from chronic}} {{administration}} of various drugs of abuse such as ethanol, opiates, and psychostimulants results in <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> largely unique to each drug class. However, one symptom that appears common to these <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> in humans {{is a negative}} affective/motivational state. Prior work in rodents has shown that elevations in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) reward thresholds provide a quantitative index {{that serves as a}} model for the negative affective state during withdrawal from psychostimulants and opiates. The current study sought to determine whether ICSS threshold elevations also accompany abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure sufficient to induce physical dependence. Rats prepared with stimulating electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus were trained in a discrete-trial current-intensity ICSS threshold procedure; subsequently they were subjected to chronic ethanol administration in ethanol vapor chambers (average blood alcohol level of 197 mg/dl). A time-dependent elevation in ICSS thresholds was observed following removal from the ethanol, but not the control, chambers. Thresholds were significantly elevated for 48 hr after cessation of ethanol exposure, with peak elevations observed at 6 - 8 hr. Blood alcohol levels were directly correlated with the magnitude of peak threshold elevation. Ratings of traditional overt signs of withdrawal showed a similar time course of expression and resolution. The results suggest that decreased function of reward systems (elevations in reward thresholds) is a common element of withdrawal from chronic administration of several diverse classes of abused drugs...|$|R
30|$|In the {{presence}} of increased adrenergic tone, tachycardia is typically present. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> are {{an example of this}} category. β-blocking agents are good options for the control of hypertension associated with hyperadrenergic states. If acute reduction in cardiac output is of concern, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (e.g., nicardipine, clevidipine) may be preferred, because these agents have fewer negative effects on the heart rate and myocardial contractility. These agents provide an interesting option for the treatment of postoperative hypertension [28]. If a vasodilating effect is best avoided (e.g., in {{the presence}} of increased intracranial hypertension), clonidine may be a good alternative to β-blocking agents.|$|R
25|$|Previously, {{physical}} dependence on benzodiazepines was largely thought to occur only in people on high-therapeutic-dose ranges. Low- or normal-dose dependence was not suspected until the 1970s, {{and it was}} not until the early 1980s that it was confirmed. Low-dose dependence has now been clearly demonstrated in both animal studies and human studies, and is a recognized clinical disadvantage of benzodiazepines. Severe <b>withdrawal</b> <b>syndromes</b> can occur from these low doses of benzodiazepines even after gradual dose reduction. An estimated 30–45% of chronic low-dose benzodiazepine users are dependent and it has been recommended that benzodiazepines even at low dosage be prescribed for a maximum of 7–14 days to avoid dependence. As a result, the global trend is toward strict regulations for the prescription of benzodiazepines due to this risk of low-dose dependence.|$|R
