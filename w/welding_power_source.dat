500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|E
50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the features of VAR compensation of variable loads. One {{of the most common}} non-symmetric non-linear <b>power</b> consumers are <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> Time and duration of the work of these sources vary randomly. To compensate the consumption of reactive power on the basis of consumption data from the three-phase electricity meters is inefficient. Compensation devices power should be calculated taking into account the asymmetrical consumption/generation of reactive power per phase and changing consumption patterns. Thyristor-controlled reactor, thyristor-switched capacitors, hybrid VAR compensators, active compensators (STATCOMs), «dynamic capacitors» can be used as the VAR compensation devices. Thyristor-controlled reactors can provide smooth regulation of reactive power, but they have high weight and size parameters and are additional sources of higher harmonics. Thyristor-switched capacitors provide stepwise adjustment of reactive power and are subject to the current higher harmonics. Hybrid VAR compensators make it possible to isolate capacitors from the higher harmonics and ensure smooth regulation, which is achieved by active filter introduction to the reactive power compensation devices based on thyristor-switched capacitors. However, this increases the cost of a compensator and complicates its control system. STATCOMs provide smooth regulation of reactive power, but they are too expensive. Perspective direction in the development of effective VAR compensation devices is «dynamic capacitor».

Manufacturing industries have to address {{the requirements of the}} government in relation to energy saving and ecologically sustainable products. These industries are also concerned with energy and material usage due to their rising costs. Therefore industries have to find solutions that can support environmental preservation yet maintain competitiveness in the market. Welding, a major manufacturing process, consumes a great deal of material and energy. It is a crucial process in improving a product’s life-cycle cost, strength, quality and reliability. Factors which lead to weld related inefficiencies have to be effectively managed, if industries are to meet their quality requirements and fulfil a high-volume production demand. Therefore {{it is important to consider}} some practical strategies in welding process for optimization of energy and material consumption. The main objective of this thesis is to explore the methods of minimizing the ecological footprint of the welding process and methods to effectively manage its material and energy usage in the welding process.

40|$|A {{modified}} electric-arc {{welding process}} has been developed for manufacturing high-quality batches of carbon nanotubes at relatively low cost. Unlike in some other processes for making carbon nanotubes, metal catalysts are not used and, consequently, {{it is not necessary}} to perform extensive cleaning and purification. Also, unlike some other processes, this process is carried out at atmospheric pressure under a hood instead of in a closed, pressurized chamber; as a result, the present process can be implemented more easily. Although the present welding-based process includes an electric arc, it differs from a prior electric-arc nanotube-production process. The welding equipment used in this process includes an AC/DC <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> with an integral helium-gas delivery system and circulating water for cooling an assembly that holds one of the welding electrodes (in this case, the anode). The cathode is a hollow carbon (optionally, graphite) rod having an outside diameter of 2 in. (approximately equal to 5. 1 cm) and an inside diameter of 5 / 8 in. (approximately equal to 1. 6 cm). The cathode is partly immersed in a water bath, such that it protrudes about 2 in. (about 5. 1 cm) above the surface of the water. The bottom end of the cathode is held underwater by a clamp, to which is connected the grounding cable of the <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> The anode is a carbon rod 1 / 8 in. (approximately equal to 0. 3 cm) in diameter. The assembly that holds the anode includes a thumbknob- driven mechanism for controlling the height of the anode. A small hood is placed over the anode to direct a flow of helium downward from the anode to the cathode during the welding process. A bell-shaped exhaust hood collects the helium and other gases from the process. During the process, as the anode is consumed, the height of the anode is adjusted to maintain an anode-to-cathode gap of 1 mm. The arc-welding process is continued until the upper end of the anode has been lowered to a specified height above the surface of the water bath. The process causes carbon nanotubes to form in the lowest 2. 5 cm of the anode. It also causes a deposit reminiscent of a sandcastle to form on the cathode. The nanotube-containing material is harvested. The cathode and anode can then be cleaned (or the anode is replaced, if necessary) and the process repeated to produce more nanotubes. Tests have shown that the process results in approximately equal to 50 -percent yield of carbon nanotubes (mostly of the single-wall type) of various sizes. Whereas the unit cost of purified single-wall carbon nanotubes produced by other process is about $ 1, 000 /g in the year 2000, it has been estimated that for the present process, the corresponding cost would be about $ 10 /g...|$|E

The implementation of robotic technology into welding processes is made difficult by the inherent process variables of part location, fit up, orientation and repeatability.

The physical processes of the welding arc are reviewed and the characteristics of a number of power sources are considered prior to preparing the operational specification for the PCM power source. From a number of possibilities the high frequency switching regulator operating in the secondary side of the power transformer was selected for detailed study. The power source was based on the use of state-of-the-art power transistors operating in a switching mode to minimise losses and to give a fast response for good welding performance. The basic operating frequency was chosen to be at the very limit of the audio range. The dynamic behaviour of the transistors and associated protection networks is critical and failure to meet all the operating limits of the transistor can be costly. To assist with the thorough understanding of the circuit behaviour and to predict the transistor switching waveforms a digital computer model was developed.
