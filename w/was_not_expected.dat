5|$|RTÉ also {{announced}} that it was seeking a new television format for the turkey, targeting a more mature audience, but the show would not be in a chat-show format. Pilots were currently in production; however, RTÉ <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to air the show until 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although the European Space Agency's current Gaia mission <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> {{to produce}} good results for stars {{brighter}} than the approximately V=6 saturation limit of the mission's instruments, actual operation has shown good performance on objects to about magnitude +3. Forced observations of brighter stars mean that final results should be available for all bright stars and a parallax for Betelgeuse will be published {{an order of magnitude}} more accurate than currently available.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season before the Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech's offense was ranked among the worst in Division I, 107th among 119teams. The Hokies averaged just 296yards per game during the regular season, and during the ACC Championship Game—the last Tech game before the Orange Bowl—had created a season-low 234yards of offense. Starting left guard Nick Marshman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to play after becoming academically ineligible following the fall semester, and was replaced by redshirt freshman Jaymes Brooks.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1944, {{his health}} had {{deteriorated}} {{to the extent}} that he was evacuated to Australia, and for a time <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to live. By early 1945 he had recovered sufficiently to be appointed to command the 6th Division. While flying to assume this new command, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft he was travelling in crashed into the sea, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|His {{appearance}} in the final was remarkable {{for the fact that}} he was the top scorer of the day with five points, despite having suffered an ankle injury in the previous match, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> (or advised) to play. He started the final and was taken off before half time. During the break, and even some way into the second half, he was receiving treatment to his ankle, including pain-killing injections.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Katrina, 150,000people and 120,000head of cattle in central Cuba were evacuated, {{according to a}} broadcast by Havana radio. As a result, Cuban Civil Defense officers issued a storm alert for five provinces. A hurricane watch was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas. Along the southeast coast of Florida, small craft were advised to remain close to port. However, the storm <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to, and did not, {{pose a threat to}} the United States.|$|E

5|$|Three rescue parties {{went out}} on {{different}} routes to find the endangered party. The first, led by Lieutenant Colonel Carpenter in charge of Troop H & I of the 10th Cavalry Regiment, relieved Forsyth on September 25. Forsyth {{had been shot in}} the thigh, breaking his leg, and in the forehead. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to survive another day.|$|E
5|$|Training camp <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> {{to be long}} {{if there}} ended up being a season. Some players {{organized}} workouts for their teams to build team chemistry. The NBPA announced it was setting up workout centers in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Houston and possibly Miami for players to work out at the union's expense.|$|E
50|$|The {{service charge}} may be {{included}} in the bill or added separately. 12.5% is reported as a common amount. Tipping for other services such as taxis and hairdressers <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected,</b> but tips <b>are</b> often given to reward good service. In some large cities tips are given to both taxi drivers and hairdressers/barbers, but again this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tipping <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{customary}} in Korean culture, and tipping <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> {{in general}} service industry.

5|$|Affeldt <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to {{make the}} Kansas City Royals' roster in 2002, but he {{was added to the}} bullpen after he had an 0.64 ERA and {{fourteen}} strikeouts (to go with just two walks) in fourteen innings in Spring training. His major league debut came on April 6 against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched two innings, giving up three hits and a run in a 140 loss. On April 24, Affeldt picked up his first major league win by pitching 3.2 innings of relief in an 82 win over the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> {{that the}} inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and {{diagrams}} were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect, so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 {{for use by}} the Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers). All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E

5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the invasion, the Syrian force {{consisted}} of a reinforced infantry brigade, supplemented by at least one armored battalion (including Renault R35 tanks) and a field artillery battalion. The troops moved to Kafr Harib and were spotted by Haganah reconnaissance, but because the attack <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected,</b> the Israeli troops did not attack the invaders. At night between 15 and 16 May, the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al-Qasr in the southwestern Golan. One company with armored reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank.|$|E
5|$|Before {{training}} camp, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> {{he would}} start the season with the Avalanche, but rather for an affiliate team of the Avalanche. However, Steve Konowalchuk's career-ending heart problem opened a roster spot and Stastny's play impressed Avalanche coach Joel Quenneville. Stastny started the season with the jersey number 62 until his teammate John-Michael Liles (switching to #4) changed his to let Stastny use #26, the same his father wore when he played for the franchise while it was in Quebec. Stastny had his first NHL assist on a goal by Wojtek Wolski in his third NHL game, on October 8 against the Vancouver Canucks. On October 21, in his eighth NHL game and first wearing number 26, Stastny scored his first NHL goal in Montreal against David Aebischer of the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named for whatever reason, it would've received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} family, whose forebears had been {{involved}} in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to work outside the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5|$|Fairley tackled an {{outbreak}} of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E
