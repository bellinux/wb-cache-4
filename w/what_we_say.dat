It is a gift which qualifies him, along with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, Vachel Lindsay and Carl Sandburg, as a great American minstrel.

500|$|Lewis did {{not share}} the desire of some members to keep the CCF [...] "ideologically pure", and adhered to the Bundist belief that [...] "it was better {{to go along with}} the masses in a not totally correct {{direction}} than to separate oneself from them and remain 'purist'." [...] However, the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party, and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations. [...] Lewis criticized the British Columbia CCF for such comments, saying [...] "... <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action. [...] If <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> and do will blunt or harm our purpose... then we are saying and doing a false thing even if, in the abstract, it is true... When, in heaven's name are we going to learn that working-class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday-school class where purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the great}} Union {{victory at the}} Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and {{the defeat of the}} Copperheads in the Ohio {{election}} in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863. Defying Lincoln's prediction that [...] "the world will little note, nor long remember <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> here", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin {{sets the}} stage for {{discussing}} this commandment by noting that an oath is calling God to witness that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> is true, and that an appropriate oath is a kind of worship of God in that it implies a profession of faith. When human testimony fails, people appeal to God as witness, as the only one able to bring hidden things to light and know what is in the heart. [...] False swearing robs God of his truth (to the observer), and therefore it is a serious matter. [...] With regard to the casual use of God's name, Calvin summarized, [...] "remember that an oath is not appointed or allowed for passion or pleasure, but for necessity." [...] He wrote that the frequency of casual use of the name of God has dulled the public conscience but that the commandment, with its penalty, still stands.|$|E

2500|$|In late November, WikiLeaks {{released}} confidential State Department cables, {{selections of}} which were then published by several major newspapers around the world. The leak of the cables led to a crisis atmosphere in the State Department, as blunt statements and assessments by U.S. and foreign diplomats became public. Clinton led the damage control effort for the U.S. abroad, and also sought to bolster the morale of shocked Foreign Service officers. In {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the cables, Clinton called officials in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Afghanistan, Canada, and China to alert them to the pending disclosures. She did note that some foreign leaders were accepting of the frank language of the cables, with one telling her, [...] "Don't worry about it. You should see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> about you." [...] She harshly criticized WikiLeaks, saying: [...] "Let's be clear: This disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy interests. It is an attack on the international community – the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity." [...] The State Department went into immediate [...] "war room" [...] mode in order to deal with the effects of the disclosures, and began implementing measures to try to prevent another such leak from happening in the future.|$|E
