500|$|During most of Wade's time at Marquette, {{his mother}} was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine. On October 14, 2001, JoLinda {{declared}} that she would change her life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church. Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas to be <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mom,</b> who he believed was clean and sober {{for the first time}} in his life. However, [...] JoLinda admitted to him that she was actually going back to prison. Wade told ESPN, [...] "I was hurt because I felt like I was just getting my mom back, and now she had to leave again." [...] On January 2, 2002, his mother went back to prison to serve her 14-month sentence. She says she has been clean since 2003.|$|E
500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mom</b> by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E
