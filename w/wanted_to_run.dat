5|$|Seeing {{himself as}} the heir to Chibás, Castro <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for Congress in the June 1952 elections. Senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical {{reputation}} and refused to nominate him; instead he was nominated {{as a candidate for}} the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo gained a considerable level of support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E
5|$|When the {{convention}} concluded, Ross returned home {{and spent the}} next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.|$|E
5|$|Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi {{stated that}} he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first Mother video game, and that it was made for the players. He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> wild with the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E

50|$|For 2016, the MotoMono {{class was}} split into Moto1000 and Moto1400. Moto1400 was for any car <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a carbon tub, or any spaceframed car <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a bike engine {{in excess of}} 1000cc. The {{dominating}} Dallara F3 derived cars moved into this class. Moto1000 was for the traditional spaceframed Jedi/Speads type of car.|$|R

5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided {{whether or not he}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party at the start of October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E
5|$|It was {{suggested}} that she would run for senator for the Buenos Aires Province at the 2017 midterm elections, but her former minister Florencio Randazzo <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for those elections as well. Refusing to run in primary elections, Kirchner asked for a shared ticket as a condition to run for senator. Randazzo did not accept the proposal. The FPV was renamed as the Citizen's Unity Party at the province and registered as a coalition of minor parties only, leaving the PJ out of it. As a result, both parties would run to the elections as unrelated parties.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of Man had {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads. The Automobile Club <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> an event {{to help develop}} fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted {{to use the same}} route as had been used for the trials. In order to make the event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, though there were complaints that the rules were too restrictive and detracted from the spectacle.|$|E

5|$|After {{serving as}} a county judge, Truman <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast {{rejected}} these ideas. Truman then thought he might serve out his career in some well-paying county sinecure, but circumstances changed when Pendergast reluctantly backed him in the 1934 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate after four other potential candidates turned him down. In the primary, Truman defeated Congressmen John J. Cochran and Jacob L. Milligan with the solid support of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy, as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official, Mason, military reservist, {{and member of the}} American Legion. In the general election, Truman defeated incumbent Republican Roscoe C. Patterson by nearly 20 percentage points as part of a continuing wave of pro-New Deal Democrats elected in response to the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo had considerable support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for a new term as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent it. To this purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but none of those negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he was also very unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage, most of the population would rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} Zidane and the Tantalus Theater Troupe {{attempting}} to kidnap Princess Garnet during her sixteenth birthday celebration {{in the city}} of Alexandria. Upon reaching her, they discover that Garnet, who is concerned about Queen Brahne's increasingly erratic behavior, had planned on escaping the city and is willing to be kidnapped, especially as their employer, Regent Cid of Lindblum, is who she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> to. During the escape from the city, the troupe is joined by Vivi, who is looking to explore, and Steiner, who decides to travel with Garnet for her protection rather than take her back against her will. After the group flees the city and its guards, their damaged airship crashes, and Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Steiner travel on together. During their journey to Lindblum, Garnet takes the alias Dagger, and the group discovers a factory in the village of Dali that is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi.|$|E
