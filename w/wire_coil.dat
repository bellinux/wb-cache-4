50|$|An {{alternator}} rotor {{is made up}} of a <b>wire</b> <b>coil</b> enveloped {{around an}} iron core. The magnetic component of the rotor is made from steel laminations to aid stamping conductor slots to specific shapes and sizes. As currents travel through the <b>wire</b> <b>coil</b> a magnetic field is created around the core, which is referred to as field current. The field current strength controls the power level of the magnetic field. Direct current (DC) drives the field current in one direction, and is delivered to the <b>wire</b> <b>coil</b> by a set of brushes and slip rings. Like any magnet, the magnetic field produced has a north and a south pole. The normal clockwise direction of the motor that the rotor is powering can be manipulated by using the magnets and magnetic fields installed {{in the design of the}} rotor, allowing the motor to run in reverse or counterclockwise.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} bonding and without bonding of <b>wire</b> <b>coiled</b> coil matrix turbulator on the heat transfer for a fully developed turbulent flow. Experiments are conducted by maintaining constant wall temperature. Tests are performed on 3 different <b>wire</b> <b>coiled</b> coil matrix turbulators of different pitches of 5, 10 and 15 mm without bonding of the turbulator. Three similar types of heat exchangers are fabricated and the <b>wire</b> <b>coiled</b> coil matrix turbulators with different pitches of 5, 10 and 15 mm are inserted in the heat exchangers and bonding is done {{on the surface of}} the tube section. Results have indicated that the heat transfer rate enhances inversely with the pitch of the <b>wire</b> <b>coiled</b> coil matrix turbulator with bonding. With a pitch of 5 mm, the turbulators without bonding have resulted in almost 25. 4 % enhancement when compared with plain tube. On the other hand, for pitches of 10 mm and 15 mm the enhancement were 20. 7 % and 16. 8 %, respectively. The empirical correlations developed for turbulators with and without bonding results in ± 6 % deviation for Nusselt number and ± 3 % for friction factor. Similarly with a pitch of 5 mm, the turbulators with bonding have resulted in almost 42 % enhancement. For pitches of 10 mm and 15 mm the enhancements were 34. 7 % and 25 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement {{techniques}} {{based on}} artificial roughness {{are used in}} numerous applications of condenser such as: the flow regime (Reynolds number), the fluid properties (Prandtl number), with and without fouling, the allowable pressure drop and the existence or absence of natural convection. The use of an enhancement technique may be conditioned by the specific application: for example, <b>wire</b> <b>coils</b> are not applicable in the food industry due to hygiene problems but corrugated and dimpled tubes are being used. In the petrochemical industry, the use of mechanically deformed tubes is not allowed for safety reasons. However, the use of <b>wire</b> <b>coils</b> does not present any problem. In boilers and heat recovery systems, <b>wire</b> <b>coils</b> are frequently used because of their easy removal for cleaning operations...|$|R

50|$|Perepiteia's {{process begins}} by {{overloading}} the generator {{to get a}} current, which typically causes the <b>wire</b> <b>coil</b> {{to build up a}} large electromagnetic field. Usually, this kind of electromagnetic field creates an effect called the back electromotive force (back EMF) due to Lenz's law. The effect should repel the spinning magnets on the rotor, and slow them down until the motor stops completely, in accordance with the law of conservation. However, instead of stopping, the rotor accelerates - i.e. the magnetic friction did not repel the magnets and <b>wire</b> <b>coil.</b> Heins states that the steel rotor and driveshaft had conducted the magnetic resistance away from the coil and back into the electric motor. In effect, the back EMF was boosting the magnetic fields used by the motor to generate electrical energy and cause acceleration. The faster the motor accelerated, the stronger the electromagnetic field it would create on the <b>wire</b> <b>coil,</b> which in turn would make the motor go even faster. Heins seemed to have created a positive feedback loop. To confirm the theory, Heins replaced part of the driveshaft with plastic pipe that wouldn't conduct the magnetic field. There was no acceleration.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} an experimental study {{on two different}} <b>wire</b> <b>coils</b> inserted in a smooth tube using both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids to characterize their thermohydraulic behavior in laminar and transitional flow. Dimensionless pitches of the <b>wire</b> <b>coils</b> were chosen as p=D = 1 and 2, whereas dimensionless wire diameter was e=D = 0. 09 for both <b>wire</b> <b>coils.</b> Non-Newtonian tests considered different viscosity types with concentration of 1 % of CMC (carboxyl-methyl-cellulose) solution in water at several temperatures; {{a wide range of}} flow conditions has been covered: Reynolds number from 10 to 1300 and Prandtl number from 150 to 1900. Newtonian test were carried out with propylene glycol as working fluid, covering a similar range of Reynolds number as the previously indicated for non-Newtonian fluids. Isothermal pressure drop tests and heat transfer experiments under uniform heat flux conditions were performed, and results were contrasted with own experimental data for the smooth tube and with well-know analytical solutions. At low Reynolds numbers, both <b>wire</b> <b>coils</b> behave as a smooth tube but accelerate transition to critical Reynolds numbers down to 500. Maximum augmentations of Fanning friction factor of 3. 5 times and of 4. 5 times of Nusselt number have been found with respect to the smooth tube...|$|R
