5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work {{that had previously been}} done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E
25|$|According to his manifesto, Rodger {{had saved}} $5,000 of pocket money, which {{was given to}} him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to {{purchase}} the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks. Gun law experts have said that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.|$|E
25|$|After {{investigation}} by the Marine Board of {{the master of the}} Advance, J. E. Delany, it was found that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the evidence upon which the Marine Board could find a charge of default and they considered that the schooner was lost in consequence of her missing stays, and parting her anchor.|$|E

25|$|At {{the ensuing}} {{hearing on the}} {{subpoena}} and the motion to quash, News 12 argued that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the unedited hearing that the state either did not know or was relevant to its case against Bonie. The prosecutors responded that they sought {{to determine if there}} was additional evidence to support their theory of Bonie's alleged financial motive to murder Moore.|$|E
25|$|The next {{target was}} a {{battleship}} escorted by three destroyers, {{on which she}} made radar contact shortly after midnight on 18–19 August. At 01:35, after getting as close as she was able, , Sailfish fired all four bow tubes. One of the escorts ran {{into the path of}} two fish; the other two missed. While the destroyer must have been severely damaged or sunk, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> JANAC.|$|E
25|$|On an {{ordinary}} day the police {{might not have}} taken his report seriously, but this time a strong force was sent to investigate, accompanied by a plain-clothes officer. They conducted {{a search of the}} plant. However, one of the plant's owners, who did not know about Irgun's unauthorized use of his property, naively convinced them there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> there to concern them. Having found nothing, the policemen left the scene.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} one of 11 {{decisions}} of the High Court referred to by the Attorney-General, Billy Hughes, as cutting down the Commonwealth's powers until they were futile and justifying the changes proposed in the 1913 referendum. The case however was not decided {{on the basis of}} the constitution, thus despite the reference to this case by the Attorney-General, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the 1913 referendum that would have affected its outcome.|$|E
25|$|There is no rule stating a team {{must play}} a wicket-keeper. On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast {{game between the}} Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match. Their keeper, Ben Cox, became an extra fielder at fly slip while spinner Moeen Ali bowled. The umpires {{consulted}} {{with each other and}} agreed that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the rules to prevent it from happening.|$|E
25|$|In , four of {{the sixteen}} {{countries}} taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among {{most of the other}} participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.|$|E

25|$|Following the Bodyline series, Voce {{declined}} severely as a bowler, but advanced as a hard-hitting batsman, to such {{an extent}} that he scored 1,020 runs for an average of over 35 in 1933 – though from Nottinghamshire's perspective, this advance <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> comparison to the loss of 140 wickets from Larwood, and a cut of half in Voce's tally. Voce was to remain a dangerous hitter for the rest of his career, and still holds the record for having played in the greatest number – five – of tenth wicket century stands in first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{disagreed}} with the majority's view that Congress had consented to {{the transfer of the}} two counties when it debated the proposed West Virginia constitution. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the debates to ever suggest that, he wrote. What Congress agreed to was that the two counties should be offered the chance to join West Virginia {{by the time of the}} new state's admission to union with the United States. These conditions had not been met by the time of admission, and thus no transfer could be constitutionally made. Congress had not agreed to additional legislative acts of transfer, and thus they could not be made without Virginia's assent (which was now withdrawn).|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, Wintzingerode with 8,000 cavalry and 40 guns arrived near Vitry-le-François while Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov with Wintzingerode's {{infantry}} plus Langeron and Sacken {{were coming}} up behind. Yorck and Kleist reached Château-Thierry. After a captured French message indicated that Napoleon was at Saint-Dizier, the Allies decided to merge their two armies and go after Napoleon with 200,000 troops. With the French emperor already blocking their supply line to Germany, the Allies determined {{to establish a new}} line from the Netherlands to Laon. At Bar-sur-Aube, Emperor Francis I of Austria was warned to leave for Dijon. Francis fled to safety with the Austrian Army of the South a few hours ahead of the French cavalry. On the evening of 23 March, a message from Napoleon's Chief of Police Anne Jean Marie René Savary was intercepted by Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn's Cossacks. It stated that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the arsenals and treasury at Paris and that the city's increasingly restive population was demanding peace. More information arrived from Napoleon's enemies in Paris.|$|E

500|$|In 1886 the High Court of Justice in London {{ruled in}} the Parks case—Jenks v. Turpin—that baccarat {{was a game}} of chance rather than skill, and was {{therefore}} illegal when gambling was involved. In reporting the case, The Times described baccarat as [...] "a new game, partly of chance, at which £1,000 may be lost in 20 minutes". After a solicitor asked the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, to clarify the position regarding baccarat in social clubs and private houses, the Home Office civil servant Godfrey Lushington stated that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the court's judgment that made baccarat illegal if not played for money.|$|E
500|$|She {{attended}} Southport State Primary School {{and experienced}} the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as {{she wanted a}} life similar to her school friends. [...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I never had that. I'd get {{home from school and}} there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|On The Rush Limbaugh Show on September 27, 2010, Limbaugh {{explained}} that he agreed to do the episode based on his continuing friendly relationship with Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, commenting, [...] "Seth appreciates and has a great affection for professionals, and we're all professionals here." [...] Limbaugh went on to reveal {{that he was in}} the studio's sound booth for [...] "three or four days at four hours at a time," [...] while recording his lines for the episode, as well as for the accompanying musical number, which Limbaugh admitted to being something of a challenge. Later on his radio show, Limbaugh went on to criticize 20th Century Fox's public relations department, following a comment by author and commentator Andrew Breitbart, accusing the Fox Broadcasting Company of [...] "burying" [...] the episode. Limbaugh also admitted, however, that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the script that [...] would want them to edit out." ...|$|E

500|$|The Observer (The Guardians sister paper) {{published}} {{an image of}} Tomlinson on the ground on Sunday, 5 April. That morning Tomlinson's family attended the scene of his death, where they met Paul Lewis, a Guardian reporter who had worked on The Observer story. Tomlinson's wife said this meeting was the first the family had heard of police contact with Tomlinson before his death. The family's police liaison officer later approached the newspaper {{to say he was}} [...] "extremely unhappy" [...] that Lewis had spoken to the family, and that the newspaper had to stay away from them for 48 hours. The IPCC accused the newspaper of [...] "doorstepping the family at a time of grief." [...] On the same day, the IPCC briefed other journalists that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the story that Tomlinson might have been assaulted by police. During this period, according to Tomlinson's family, they were prevented from seeing his body; they were first allowed to see him six days after his death.|$|E
500|$|The SFPA {{deferred}} to the Magnuson–Stevens Act for its {{definition of a}} fishing vessel. According to that statute, a fishing vessel was one that either engaged in fishing, or [...] "aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea {{in the performance of}} any activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation, or processing." [...] Moskowitz rejected NOAA's argument that the KD II was engaged in fishing and therefore a fishing vessel because, under its previous ownership, it had been equipped with longline equipment and held a federal permit. That had lapsed shortly after Tran and Yu bought the ship and was no longer valid, so neither was the argument based on paper. [...] "Whether the KD II is in fact a fishing vessel under [...] depends on its configuration and how it was outfitted {{at the time of the}} seizure," [...] he wrote. Since there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the record about that, he declined to decide the question on that grounds.|$|E
500|$|Fleder {{also asked}} for stylistic {{touches on the}} episode which were {{inconsistent}} with the show's typical emphasis on documentary-style realism. For example, he arranged for red scrim lighting {{to reflect on the}} subway car to add an artistic visual touch, even though there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> particular in the subway station that reflected such a light. Upon hearing of the technique, Yoshimura was initially concerned, saying [...] "Oh, he's getting artsy fartsy with me." [...] Just before Lange's death, Fleder included a close-up with Braugher looking directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall in a way typically forbidden on the show. During an outdoor dialogue scene between Johnson and Seda while the characters were driving in a car, Fleder filmed it by placing the camera outside the car's front windshield and panning {{back and forth between the}} two actors. Unbeknownst to Fleder, all car shots on Homicide: Life on the Street are only allowed to be filmed from inside the car to keep the scene more realistic. As a result of Fleder's car scene, a memo was circulated to the cast and crew reminding them of this policy and threatening to fire anybody who allowed a scene to be shot through the windshield again.|$|E
