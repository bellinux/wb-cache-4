Several carriers who underwrite policies will not allow professionals to backdate your coverage to your expiration date without a valid explanation (such as, but not limited to: natural disaster or personal medical issue that prevented you from renewing on time) and a signed <b>warranty</b> <b>letter</b> informing the carrier the specific professional is {{not aware of any}} pending claims. For example, with an effective date of 06/01/2010 and coverage expiring on 06/01/2011 and the insured does not renew the coverage on or before 06/01/2011 then the insured may have to enroll with a gap in coverage, resulting in a loss of prior acts coverage such that there is no coverage for any business placed prior to their new effective date. Although some carriers may allow a 30- to 45-day grace period, it is common for them to disallow this.|$|E

[...] His reply went on to state that a daily limit is not a valid reason for denying a customer's right to exchange their Craftsman tools under the Lifetime <b>Warranty.</b> Despite that <b>letter</b> and his assurance, individual stores as of 2015 have varying policies. After Stanley Black & Decker purchased Craftsman in 2017 it became unclear whether the new owner would honor the historic warranty.|$|R
