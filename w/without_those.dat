5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength <b>without</b> <b>those</b> currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|Some {{residents}} of Hawaii speak Hawaii Creole English (HCE), endonymically called pidgin or pidgin English. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, {{the increase in}} immigration—mainly from China, Japan, Portugal—especially from the Azores and Madeira, and Spain—catalyzed {{the development of a}} hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as pidgin. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words <b>without</b> <b>those</b> words being considered archaic. Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ahi.|$|E
25|$|After the Pacification of Ghent {{the entire}} Habsburg Netherlands had risen against Philip II of Spain. When the new Governor-General, Philip's {{half-brother}} Don Juan, {{arrived in the}} country in November, 1576, he initially feigned readiness to cooperate with the States-General, but soon there was a rupture, and the war was resumed. From January, 1578 on, the reinforcements that were sent to Don Juan by way of the Spanish Road had made him strong enough to go on the offensive. Almost immediately, he gained a stunning victory in the Battle of Gembloux. This motivated foreign powers to intervene on behalf of the States-General. Queen Elizabeth of England sent money and troops, as did the Duke of Anjou. These reinforcements formed the backbone of a reconstituted States Army that took up formation in a reinforced encampment at Rijmenam during July, 1578. The nominal commander of this force was the Count of Boussu. It consisted mainly of English mercenaries under Sir John Norris and Sir Richard Bingham, Scottish mercenaries under Robert Stuart, and French Huguenots under François de la Noue. On the eve of the battle it was waiting for further reinforcements from the Count Palatine, who was waiting near Zutphen for the arrival of a subsidy that Queen Elizabeth had promised, but not yet paid. <b>Without</b> <b>those</b> considerable reinforcements it counted about 18,000-foot and 2,000 horse.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} pet rearing experience {{to the development of}} empathy, 221 (120 male and 101 female) elementary school students in the fifth and sixth grade submitted a questionnaire. The subjects were divided into those with experience and <b>those</b> <b>without</b> experience. <b>Those</b> with experience were subdivided according to types of pets. Using the ESC 20 scale or ESC 18 scale based on the Empathy Scale for Children constructed by Sakurai (1986) the scores of empathy were as follows. First the empathy scores of male elementary school students who experienced pet rearing were higher than <b>those</b> <b>without</b> experience. Second the empathy scores of male elementary school students who experienced rearing dogs or hamsters were higher than <b>those</b> <b>without</b> experience.

Prior to the album being picked up by the likes of Universal Motown and GOOD Music, he had previously worked with mentor and fellow rapper Kanye West on his 2008 record 808s & Heartbreak, co-writing four hits for it. He said that <b>without</b> <b>those</b> song successes Man on the Moon: The End of Day would not have been picked up by any major labels. Cudi, who became West's protege and collaborator, hoped Man on the Moon: The End of Day would show people that he had his own voice and set him apart. The record was originally titled Man on the Moon: The Guardians, but its subtitle was later changed to The End of Day. Performance artist Andy Kaufman partly inspired the new title. He planned for this record to be the first in a trilogy, with the next edition being entitled The Ghost and the Machine.|$|E
