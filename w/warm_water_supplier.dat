40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{phenomenon}} of bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{in the city of}} Harare, Zimbabwe’s largest urban metropolis and capital. Bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> began in 2005 to sell domestic water to middle- and high-income suburbs because of shortcomings in the city’s water delivery system without state regulation, and have since become a permanent feature of the Zimbabwean urban waterscape. The study was conducted between 2012 and 2013 in three up-market suburbs of Harare, which were known to depend on bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers.</b> State regulation of bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> was introduced in 2013, close to a decade after the start of operations, indicating a reactive and reluctant acknowledgement that bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> were now significant players in water service provision. The regulation was, however, poorly conceptualised, based on potable water standards, which proved to be cumbersome and placed onerous demands on the suppliers. The paper concludes that bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> are playing a critical role in water service provision in Zimbabwe’s largest metropolis and represent a spontaneous injection of local private capital in the urban domestic water supply sector. They can therefore be seen as a viable endogenous form of privatisation of urban domestic water service (as contrasted to multinational companies) but should be viewed as complementing rather than replacing functional urban water supply systems. The operations of bulk <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> can be enhanced if a regulatory regime, informed by realities on the ground is crafted...|$|R

40|$|Samples of {{drinking}} water are routinely analysed for four trihalomethanes (THMs), which are indicators of by-products of disinfection with chlorine, by UK <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> to demonstrate compliance with regulations. The THM data for 1992 – 1993 to 1997 – 1998 for three <b>water</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{in the north and}} midlands of England were made available for a UK epidemiological study of the association between disinfection by-products and adverse birth outcomes. This paper describes the THM levels in these three supply regions and discusses possible sources of variation. THM levels varied between different suppliers' water, and average THM levels were within the regulatory limits. Chloroform was the predominant THM in all water types apart from the ground <b>water</b> of one <b>supplier.</b> The supplier that distributed more ground and lowland surface water had higher dibromochloromethane (DBCM) and bromoform levels and lower chloroform levels than the other two <b>suppliers.</b> In the <b>water</b> of two <b>suppliers,</b> seasonal fluctuations in bromodichloromethane (BDCM) and DBCM levels were found with levels peaking in the summer and autumn. In the other <b>water</b> <b>supplier,</b> chloroform levels followed a similar seasonal trend whereas BDCM and DBCM levels did not. For all three <b>water</b> <b>suppliers,</b> chloroform levels declined throughout 1995 when there was a drought period.
