25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
500|$|Actor Billy Bob Thornton {{admitted}} to {{watching the show}} during a 2016 interview with GQ. He and his daughter Bella used to <b>watch</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony, which she eventually grew out of, and when searching for the series to watch again, came across Friendship Is Magic and started watching it with her. He also liked the show's positive messages about how the world works, pointing to [...] "The Cutie Map" [...] as an example. On an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, Thornton also claimed that while his daughter's favorite character is Twilight Sparkle, his favorites were Fluttershy (who he said was his favorite because [...] "she talks like Marilyn Monroe") and Rainbow Dash.|$|E
500|$|Ned and Maude Flanders sing Maggie to {{bed with}} {{their own version of}} Sonny & Cher's song [...] "I Got You Babe". The Itchy & Scratchy cartoon that Lisa and Bart watch is called [...] "Foster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!", a {{reference}} to the 1965 film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!. Flanders says that he used to let his sons <b>watch</b> <b>My</b> Three Sons, but it got them [...] "all worked up" [...] before bedtime. The headline of a newspaper that Marge gives to Lisa for her history project is [...] "40 Trampled at Poco Concert", a reference to American rock band Poco. While riding in Flanders's car, Maggie spins her head around with a scary smile on her face to look at Bart and Lisa, as in the 1973 film The Exorcist.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} song, Sophie Muller filmed a music video for [...] "Take Me Home" [...] which was {{released}} on the song's CD single. The video was also included in her video album <b>Watch</b> <b>My</b> Lips (2002).' It opens with Ellis-Bextor, {{dressed in a black}} one-strap dress, in front of a yellow-toned painting of a woman with red lips. Throughout the music video, Ellis-Bextor is seen in a variety of dresses and outfits—she appears {{standing in front of a}} green mural with a flowery large tablecloth, while dressing a see-through shirt, which reveals her black bra; other scene shows her with a dark green gown; other shows her with a flower and leaves pattern and holding a in front of a projected image which shows the Eiffel Tower from far. She also appears dressed in a green trench coat in another scene. Usually, costume and location scenes are accompanied by a change of gradient color, which are projected onto Ellis-Bextor. By the middle of the video, she walks across a street, surrounded by formally-dressed men, who dance around her and lift her. After the song's middle 8 plays, the lights of the street turn on and various French event posters are shown. The video concludes as they all enter a disco club. She also performed the track at the Read My Lips Tour (2002–03), serving as its encore. Ellis-Bextor would shortly introduce the song, with green eye makeup and red lipstick, dressed in a cream-colored dress and pink heels. As the backing track started playing, she would start singing and clapping her hands as the public imitated her, and the audience was showered with confetti.|$|E

Many times I held them, blood all over me. The worst feeling I had was that you can’t help them at all...I saw kids and adults got hit in the head, by the bullets, crawling. So I don't believe in crawling anymore. I just stood up and shoot like hell...I fought about two or three months. The thing that I couldn't take is to <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> friends dying every day.

2500|$|Stanley Donen, {{brought to}} Hollywood by Kelly {{to be his}} {{assistant}} choreographer, received co-director credit for On the Town. According to Kelly: [...] "...when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants. I needed one to <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> performance, and one {{to work with the}} cameraman on the timing..without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney and Jeanne Coyne I could never have done these things. When we came to do On the Town, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators." [...] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the [...] "Day in New York" [...] routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.|$|E

The fight took place on 16 January 2016 (marketed by Salter Brothers Entertainment as [...] "Haye Day") at the O2 Arena in London, and was Haye's first fight {{in more than three}} years since stopping Dereck Chisora in 2012.
