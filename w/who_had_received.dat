5|$|Geffen's press {{promotion}} for Nevermind {{was lower}} than that typical of a major record label.

5|$|In a {{press conference}} on January 16, 2013 shortly after being {{notified}} he would receive the medal, Romesha played down his actions in the conflict, noting many other veterans <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> more serious injuries in the battle.

5|$|Schnaufer, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> the German Cross in Gold on 16 August 1943, flew {{his first}} {{operational}} mission with 12./NJG1 {{on the night}} of 17/18 August 1943. Although uncertain, it is assumed that Handke was Schnaufer's radio and radar operator on this mission. Bomber Command had targeted Peenemünde and the V-weapons test centre that night. Schnaufer, who had been tasked with leading one of the first Zahme Sau missions under Y-Control, had to abort the mission early due to engine trouble.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since {{it could be}} read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed {{that there was no}} increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40. Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not. The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E

5|$|Members of the IOC did not {{disclose}} their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> assistance from China {{in the construction of}} stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision. Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.|$|E
5|$|Since 1853, the General Assembly has {{selected}} the first-place finisher in every gubernatorial election {{that has come}} before it, most recently in 2010, when Shumlin received 49.5% of the vote and was chosen over Republican Brian Dubie, and in 2002, when the Democratic-controlled legislature picked Republican Jim Douglas, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> 44.9%, over Democrat Doug Racine, who received 42.4%. The Assembly most recently reversed a plurality vote in the 1976 lieutenant gubernatorial election, when the Republican-controlled legislature picked Republican T. Garry Buckley rather than Democrat John Alden, who was suspected, and later convicted, of insurance fraud.|$|E
5|$|The film cast three Bajau teenagers, Gita Novalista, Eko and Zainal, {{in their}} feature film debuts; {{the three were}} the first Bajau {{to play in a}} feature film. More {{experienced}} actors, including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> two Citra Awards), were also cast. Hasiholan later stated that it had been her most challenging role yet, citing the cultural differences between the Bajau and what she was familiar with as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother. In preparing for their roles, Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E

5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the glass door of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|While at Hall-Place, Smart {{was sent}} to the local Maidstone Grammar School where he was taught by Charles Walwyn, a scholar from Eton College <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>{{received}}</b> an MA from King's College, Cambridge in 1696. It was here that Smart received an intensive education in Latin and Greek. He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings to live near relatives in Durham after selling off {{a large portion of the}} estate to pay off Peter Smart's debts.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in April, Atlanta was {{decommissioned}} in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 {{and placed}} in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled in a civil war. Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.|$|E
