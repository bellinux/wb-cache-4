5|$|Adams <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> accept {{challenge}} matches at his performances. For example, at {{an exhibition}} held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty {{of the best}} players in the city. Adams manipulated the balls with his fingers, while his opponents used cues and were given a handicap equivalent to a 1,000 point lead.|$|E
5|$|Along with promotions, Tierney would {{advocate}} {{on behalf}} of his clients when targeted by news reporters. Tierney <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> contact news editors to complain about coverage of his clients, accusing news reporters of being biased, incompetent and unprofessional. The most notable of Tierney's complaints to reporters was directed at The Philadelphia Inquirer and Inquirer reporter Ralph Cipriano.|$|E
5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E
25|$|It <b>would</b> also <b>sometimes</b> be {{referred}} to as I Am The Best Artist gallery once René's signature murals had gained notoriety.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that, George. Sometimes I thought she <b>would,</b> and <b>sometimes</b> that she wouldn't. You have never {{understood}} Lucinda." ...|$|R
60|$|Of late such {{had been}} John Perkins's habit. At ten or eleven he <b>would</b> return. <b>Sometimes</b> Katy <b>would</b> be asleep; <b>sometimes</b> waiting up, ready to melt in the {{crucible}} of her ire {{a little more}} gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony. For these things Cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the Frogmore flats.|$|R
5|$|Besieged forces <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> launch sorties in {{an attempt}} to fire the attackers' camps or equipment. When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986–987, his troops became drunk one night, and Duke Charles's men sallied forth and torched the camp, forcing Hugh to abandon the siege.|$|E
5|$|Nasser and Tahia <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> discuss {{politics}} at home, {{but for the}} most part, Nasser kept his career separate from his family life. He preferred to spend most of his free time with his children. Nasser and Tahia had two daughters and three sons: Hoda, Mona, Khaled, Abdel Hamid, and Abdel Hakim.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured {{the idea of}} a holiday camp. He had seen the way landladies in seaside resorts <b>would,</b> <b>sometimes</b> literally, push {{families}} out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather. Butlin {{toyed with the idea of}} providing holiday accommodation that encouraged holiday-makers to stay on the site and even provided entertainment for them between meals.|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't know {{anything}} at all about it," [...] said Mr Whittlestaff. [...] "It would be very much more becoming if you <b>would</b> learn <b>sometimes</b> to hold your tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a sight the lad looks!" [...] she <b>would</b> exclaim <b>sometimes,</b> {{taking back}} the baby, that was smutted {{on the face}} from his father's kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.|$|R
50|$|Gwynne {{became a}} firm {{friend of the}} clergyman Theophilus Evans and from 1727 Evans was {{employed}} as a private chaplain at the Gwynne residence in Garth where he <b>would</b> preach <b>sometimes</b> {{more than once a}} day.|$|R
5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{personal}} advertisements section in newspapers <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{be used to}} exchange messages encrypted using simple cipher schemes. Kahn (1967) describes instances of lovers engaging in secret communications enciphered using the Caesar cipher in The Times. Even as late as 1915, the Caesar cipher was in use: the Russian army employed it {{as a replacement for}} more complicated ciphers which had proved to be too difficult for their troops to master; German and Austrian cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their messages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} for the only time to western Canada, traveling {{from town to town}} by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, and to get a better view, the two <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> sit in front of the locomotive on the train's cowcatcher. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E
50|$|Italian theaters {{developed}} slowly {{throughout the}} renaissance helping with Commedia dell'Arte Troupes, although the developments were mostly {{thanks to the}} Opera. By 1637 theaters in Venice had evolved into having a pit, box, gallery, and proscenium arch. Traveling Commedia dell'Arte Troupes used theaters where they found them, <b>sometimes</b> <b>would</b> help create them, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>would</b> {{have to make do}} without them.|$|R
60|$|With {{his round}} unmoved face, {{a lot of}} fine white hair waving in the wind-eddies of the spanker, his glance {{levelled}} over the sea {{he seemed to be}} addressing the universe across her reclining form. She <b>would</b> protest <b>sometimes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I do believe, Lionel," [...] said Marian, [...] "that {{you could}} do more for her than any body else. If you <b>would</b> but <b>sometimes</b> let her do things for you, ask her to help you, as--as you ask me." ...|$|R
5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a high degree of protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E
5|$|Much of Halo 4s {{music was}} written on guitar or piano; at home, Davidge <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> sing melodies into a {{dictaphone}} for later transcription. While composing, he viewed slideshow images and visual material to influence his work. Davidge played through unfinished portions of the game for inspiration; he ended up using the game's development concept art as inspiration for his music.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2015, Lin {{signed a}} two-year, $4.3 million {{contract}} with the Charlotte Hornets, who used their bi-annual exception in the deal. He had been open to re-joining New York, {{but they were not}} interested, having drafted guard Jerian Grant to pair with veteran José Calderón at point guard. Lin was projected to back up Hornets point guard Kemba Walker, and coach Steve Clifford envisioned that the two pick-and-roll players <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> play together.|$|E
50|$|To {{sabotage}} movement plans, {{the fiscal}} conservatives <b>sometimes</b> <b>would</b> leak movement conservatives' plans to the press.|$|R
60|$|Gratian gasped. Noel <b>would</b> {{say things}} <b>sometimes</b> {{which made her}} feel the younger of the two.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "future-in-the-past" [...] tense (or form) is {{sometimes}} referred to. This takes {{essentially the same}} form as the conditional, that is, it is made using the auxiliary <b>would</b> (or <b>sometimes</b> should in the first person; see shall and will).|$|R
5|$|Percy Powell-Cotton {{was born}} in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers. His expeditions were {{conducted}} for scientific research, and <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> take 18 months. In 1896, Major Powell-Cotton founded the Powell-Cotton Museum at Quex Park to display his collection of mammals and artefacts acquired on his expeditions to Africa and Asia. The animals were mounted by the noted taxidermist Rowland Ward.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} decade, {{the casino}} began exhibiting burlesque and vaudeville acts to draw crowds, and a raised stage was installed for the live performances. The building eventually became village property, and housed the town's fire house. Known as Firemen's Hall, {{the building was}} also used by the town's fire department as a basketball court. Basketball was extremely popular in Rosendale in the 1940s. On Friday nights the Firemen's Hall became a dance hall, and people <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> square dance in formal attire.|$|E
5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, who <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> demand {{provisions for}} passage, but none were given {{and none of}} the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, and Buck and some {{of the rest of the}} party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.|$|E
50|$|Typically Roman men wore less jewelry {{than their}} female counterparts. Finger rings and fibulae {{were the most}} common forms of jewelry worn by men, but they <b>would</b> also <b>sometimes</b> wear pendants. Roman men, unlike Greek men, wore {{multiple}} rings at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Jefferson. [...] "Well, I allow we {{want you}} to stop. There's another thing. I {{understand}} my partner kind of promised a boat <b>would</b> go. <b>Sometimes</b> he's rash, but I feel I've got to see him out." ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2010 it was {{confirmed}} that Agnes's third French single <b>would</b> be <b>Sometimes</b> I Forget and {{would serve as}} the follow-up to the massive success of [...] "Release Me" [...] and [...] "On and On", which combined had sold over 160,000 copies in France.|$|R
5|$|Tuatara {{feature in}} a number of {{indigenous}} legends, and are held as ariki (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. Tuatara also indicate tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana, meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent tuatara, near their genitals. Today, tuatara are regarded as a taonga (special treasure).|$|E
5|$|As a showman, Butlin {{quickly became}} successful, one stall {{becoming}} several, and several becoming his own travelling fair. Butlin soon had fixed fairground sites {{as well as}} his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island, Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts <b>would</b> (<b>sometimes</b> literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to nurture the idea of a holiday camp similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{of demand}} for his act in Australia, Robey {{conducted}} a second tour of {{the country at the}} start of 1939. While he was appearing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, war broke out with Germany. Robey returned to England and concentrated his efforts on entertaining {{to raise money for the}} war effort. He signed up with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He <b>would</b> <b>sometimes</b> turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.|$|E
5000|$|It had no {{temperature}} thermostat or shut-off mechanism {{other than}} switching the blower off. (Cold air <b>would</b> still <b>sometimes</b> enter {{the car with}} any movement as the drive belt was continuously connected to the compressor—later systems would use electrically operated clutches to remedy this problem.) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1995 he was {{appointed}} by President Mubarak to serve temporarily in the General Congregation Council of the Coptic Church. He was a very close and trusted friend of Pope Shenouda III.
