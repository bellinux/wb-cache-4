5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins <b>whereby</b> <b>the</b> proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year of}} negotiation, Tiberius led {{a sizable}} force into Armenia, presumably {{with the goal of}} {{establishing}} it as a Roman client-state and ending the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border.

Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon juice that has been freshly squeezed may be used, which can produce a superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using the juice from Meyer lemons.|$|E

5|$|Apatodon mirus, {{based on}} a scrap of {{vertebra}} Marsh first {{thought to be a}} mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of Allosaurus fragilis. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure, and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of Apatodon with Allosaurus was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, <b>whereby</b> <b>the</b> latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the Apatodon holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, <b>whereby</b> <b>the</b> oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians {{wanted to use the}} rapid transit. Since the Ring Line would increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached <b>whereby</b> <b>the</b> light rail line would be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E

The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E
