40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to examine}} the effects of consumption of beverages (caffeinated and alcoholic) and physical activity on the frequency and severity of hot flashes in peri-menopausal, menopausal, and post-menopausal women by conducting an on-line survey of women over the age of 40 employed at a Midwestern University. One-hundred ninety-six women participated in this study. Majority of participants were age 50 - 59 (n= 104, 53. 1 %), and were in the naturally post-menopausal reproductive stage (n= 81, 41. 3 %). Overall, results revealed that the effects of self-reported physical activity, average daily caffeine and alcohol intake were not significant in predicting the frequency of hot flashes (R 2 =. 043, F(6, 184) = 1. 39, p=. 221). However, results revealed a small, but statistically significant effect of physical activity, caffeine, and alcohol intake on severity of hot flashes (R 2 =. 068, F(6, 180) = 2. 195, p =. 046). Additionally, relatively more participation in aerobic physical activity increased frequency of hot flashes (p=. 031); <b>while</b> <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> of aerobic physical activity had an inverse relationship on both frequency and severity of hot flashes (p=. 011, p=. 003, respectively).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of caffeine, alcohol, and physical activity (PA) on the perceived frequency and severity of hot flashes in menopausal women. Female employees at a Mid-Western university were invited to participate in an on-line survey. The 26 -itemized Wo- men’s Health Survey (WHS) included questions regarding demographics, menopausal stage, experience of hot flashes, consumption of caffeinated beverages and alcohol, and participation in PA. One-hundred and ninety-six women completed the study. Ordinary Least Squares regressions revealed PA, caffeine, and alcohol intake were significant in predicting the severity of hot flashes (R 2 = 0. 068, F(6, 180) = 2. 195, p = 0. 046), though they did not predict frequency of hot flashes (R 2 = 0. 043, F(6, 184) = 1. 39, p = 0. 221). Participation in aerobic PA increased frequency of hot flashes (p = 0. 031); <b>while</b> <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> of aerobic PA had an inverse relationship on both frequency and severity of hot flashes (p = 0. 011, p = 0. 003, respectively). Spearman correlations demonstrated a positive relationship between caffeinated soda intake and frequency (r = 0. 17, p = 0. 06) and severity (r = 0. 19, p = 0. 04) of hot flashes. Beverage consumption and PA may predict severity of hot flashes in women. Less frequent, higher intensity aerobic PA may lead to fewer, less severe hot flashes...|$|E

Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} is to review the current literature on physical conditioning for load carriage and present the findings in a manner that will allow physical conditioning practitioners a means of applying them in a conditioning program. Methods:	 Using	key	search	terms,	 a	literature	search	of	academic	databases	(both	civilian	and	military) 		 was conducted, with additional relevant literature sought from military and civilian colleagues. Gathered papers were assessed against	several	key	criteria	and	limited	to	those	relating	specifically	to	physical	conditioning	and	military load carriage. These	papers	were	reviewed	to	glean	key	findings	in	the	light	of	information	from	additional	sources that were employed to contextualise the findings. Results: The search results yielded seven original research papers, one conference paper and four secondary source papers (military reports, journal articles). Conclusions: Research suggests that, while other forms of conditioning may be of a supplemental benefit, an effective load carriage conditioning program will include specific load carriage training conducted between two and four times per month. Loads must be sufficient to elicit a physiological response proportionate to that recommended for cardiovascular and metabolic fitness development, with the duration and distance gradually progressed to levels that meet training and operational needs. <b>While</b> <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> training may be of particular value,	 excessive	training	volume	may	increase	the	risk	of	both	acute	and	overuse	injury	risks...|$|E

30|$|Fire {{managers}} are increasingly tasked with restoring natural fire regimes to grasslands and prairies around the world, {{as well as}} navigating multiple and competing management objectives for diverse taxa (Van Lear et al. 2005, Ryan et al. 2013). Thus, {{it is important to}} understand the relationship between fire intensity, severity, and vegetation effects and how fire ignition patterns influence those relationships. Across five different prescribed burns in PNW prairies, we found that maximum surface temperature was positively correlated with fire severity. This result aligns with findings from other systems (Hartford and Frandsen 1992, Chafer et al. 2004, Bradley et al. 2006) and supports the idea that the higher temperatures will consume more of the surface litter and moss, and expose more bare ground for seed germination. The TITAN analysis suggests that perennial life form groups decrease with increasing fire severity. However, the synchronous negative association of exotic perennials and exotic annual forbs with increasing fire severity could also be driven by associated herbicide management. The newly exposed soil found after severe late summer fires provides excellent germination conditions for disturbance-adapted annual species (such as Teesdalia nudicaulis [L.] W.T. Aiton) that are ubiquitous after hotter burns (Dunwiddie et al. 2014). This post-fire flush is composed primarily of exotic perennial and annual species, which are typically the first to germinate and are often more abundant compared to later germinating native species (Stanley et al. 2011). Fall herbicide management takes advantage of this phenological disparity between native and exotic species, and likely confounds direct patterns between exotic species and fire severity. We further suspect this to be true because exotic annual grasses showed the opposite trend (though weakly), and this life form group typically germinates much later after the initial fall herbicide management (A. Martin, Center for Natural Lands Management, Olympia, Washington, USA, personal observation). Thus, <b>while</b> <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> fire favors seed bank species and disturbs established shallow-rooted perennials (Pyke et al. 2010), the post-burn herbicide management confounds our ability to detect those expected patterns. Future work should assess plant communities in burned areas without herbicide treatments to better assess the direct relationship between fire severity and exotic species in this system.|$|E

30|$|Several {{studies in}} human {{subjects}} {{have demonstrated that}} acute aerobic exercise induced increased BDNF in peripheral blood (Nofuji et al. 2012; Schmolesky et al. 2013; Gustafsson et al. 2009; Rasmussen et al. 2009; Ferris et al. 2007; Gold et al. 2003; Rojas Vega et al. 2006; Tang et al. 2008). The acute effect of exercise on human serum BDNF levels is characterized as a transient, moderate (approximately 20 to 40 %) increase (Gold et al. 2003; Rojas Vega et al. 2006; Tang et al. 2008). Serum BDNF levels rise during aerobic exercise, and quickly return to baseline levels upon exercise cessation, approximately 10 – 15  minutes after exercise termination (Rojas Vega et al. 2006; Tang et al. 2008). Ferris et al. (2007) suggested that low intensity exercise was insufficient to elevate BDNF levels relative to baseline, <b>while</b> <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> exercise for a comparable duration significantly elevated serum BDNF levels.|$|R

The total ionization probability, the. instantaneous ionization probability; and the partial ionization probabilities {{in a pair}} of opposite directions are obtained. The partial ionization probabilities are not always equal to each other which is termed as inversion asymmetry. The variation of asymmetry degree with the CE phase, the pulse duration and the pulse intensity is studied. It is found that the pulse intensity affects the asymmetry degree in many aspects. Firstly, the asymmetry is more distinct at <b>higher</b> <b>intensities</b> than that at lower intensities when the pulse duration exceeds 4 cycles; secondly, the maximal asymmetry in lower intensities varies with the CE phase visibly <b>while</b> at <b>higher</b> <b>intensities</b> riot; thirdly, the partial ionization probabilities equal to each other for some special CE phases.

This research set out to investigate how the subsequent increase in the intensity of religious cues in an advertisement impact consumers’ attitudes towards the advertisement, the brand and purchase intention while taking into account Muslim consumers. Consumers’ level of religiosity and self-reference are also taken into account to test how they interact with consumer attitudes in this advertising phenomenon. This research is carried out in a context where not only the communication but also the product used in the advertisement is congruent to the religious beliefs of the audience. A structured questionnaire along with an experimental stimulus was designed to elicit consumer attitudes, level of religiosity and self-reference.

The DBA/ 2 -congenic Dmdmdx(“D 2 ”) mouse {{is a novel}} dystrophic model that is uncharacterized physiologically. PURPOSE: <b>While</b> <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> physical activity levels declines with MD disease progression, we examined whether 4 -month old D 2 mice (n= 10) engage in less moderate to <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> physical activity than age-matched controls (“D 2 J” mice, n= 8). METHODS: Physical activity quantification was performed by 0 - 1 sampling according to a species-specific activity ethnogram of walking, wall pacing, climbing, running and jumping. Activity counts were recorded by a blinded observer every 15 -seconds for a 10 -minute session (total of 40 observation periods). Individual activity counts were recorded and analyzed in a mouse strain-dependent fashion. An activity-scaled composite metric was also calculated whereby activity sums were scaled for walking and wall pacing (x 2), climbing and running (x 2. 5), and jumping (x 3). RESULTS: Scores for individual activities were similar between mouse strains for walking (7 % mean group difference, p= 0. 120), running (61 % mean group difference, p= 0. 145). Moreover, composite metric analyses revealed that scores were not different between mouse strains (D 2 J 82 ± 36, D 2 61 ± 23; p= 0. 477). In contrast, D 2 mice performed 70 % less climbing (p= 0. 049) and 44 % less jumping (p= 0. 046) than D 2 J mice. CONCLUSION: Findings from composite analysis and some activity counts reveal that D 2 J controls and D 2 congenital dystrophic mice perform statistically similar amounts of physical activity. However, individual activity analyses indicate that D 2 mice engage in less climbing and jumping than D 2 J healthy control mice.

30|$|<b>Higher</b> {{illumination}} <b>intensities</b> {{result in}} <b>higher</b> conductances, {{as shown in}} Figures 2 c and 2 f, resulting in cells being depolarised more quickly. For a given illumination intensity, pulsed light can reduce the frequency of seizure waves because the stimulatory input rapidly drops to zero when light is turned off, sending the cortex back to a normally functioning state. In other words, increasing the time of no illumination when using a pulsed light source decreases seizure frequency. This difference can be seen between Figure 2 d, where constant illumination is used, and Figure 2 g, where pulsed illumination is used. Counter-intuitively, though, <b>while</b> a <b>higher</b> <b>intensity</b> depolarises cells more quickly, it reduces the frequency of seizure waves as seen by comparing Figures 2 a and 2 d. One {{possible explanation is that}} the rate of change of mean soma potential given in equation 1 is lower for <b>higher</b> <b>intensities</b> because the stimulation term, u, is always positive on account of using ChR 2, a cation pump. A higher rate of change decreases the time required to change from a lower to a higher firing rate and back.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{established}} that low intensities of exercise produce beneficial effects for the brain, <b>while</b> <b>high</b> <b>intensities</b> can cause some neuronal damage (e. g. exacerbated inflammatory response and cell death). Although these effects are documented in the mature brain, the influence of exercise intensities in the developing brain has been poorly explored. To investigate the impact of exercise intensity in developing rats, we evaluated the hippocampal level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL 6 and IL 10) and the occurrence of hippocampal cell degeneration and proliferation {{at different stages of}} postnatal brain development of rats submitted to two physical exercise intensities. To this point, male rats were divided into different age groups: P 21, P 31, P 41 and P 51. Each age group was submitted to two exercise <b>intensities</b> (low and <b>high)</b> on a treadmill over 10 consecutive days, except the control rats. We verified that the density of proliferating cells was significantly higher in the dentate gyrus of rats submitted to low-intensity exercise from P 21 to P 30 compared with high-intensity exercise and control rats. A significant increase of proliferative cell density was found in rats submitted to high-intensity exercise from P 31 to P 40 when compared to low-intensity exercise and control rats. Elevated hippocampal levels of IL 6 were detected in rats submitted to high-intensity exercise from P 21 to P 30 compared to control rats. From P 41 to P 50 period, higher levels of BDNF, TNFα and IL 10 were found in the hippocampal formation of rats submitted to high-intensity exercise in relation to their control rats. Our data show that exercise-induced neuroplastic effects on BDNF levels and cellular proliferation in the hippocampal region are dependent on exercise intensity and developmental period. Thus, exercise intensity is an inflammation-inducing factor and exercise-induced inflammatory response during the postnatal brain development is also related to developmental stage. Our findings indicate that neuroplastic changes induced by exercise in developing rats depend on both age and training intensity...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In this naturalistic {{study the}} aim was to examine the impact on seizure {{duration}} of stimulus intensity, previous treatments (during the first course of ECT), age, gender, and electrode placement. Method: The database of the ECT Service of the Royal Hobart Hospital was examined for the 15 years ending in 2010. First courses of ECT were identified in which the stimulus intensity was not altered and at least 5 treatments were provided. Seizure duration was determined by cessation of clonic movements. Result: 383 patients (164 males) met selection criteria.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{and intensity of}} soil-transmitted helminth infections {{and their relationship to}} anthropometric indices of 1, 351 school children from Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria were evaluated. 739 (54. 70 %) of the subjects were infected by soil-transmitted helminths (STH). The overall prevalences by species were Ascaris lumbricoides (48. 41 %), hookworms (29. 76 %), and Trichuris trichiura (17. 39 %). 174 (12. 88 %) were infected with two or more STHs. Males (60. 81 %) were generally more infected than females (43. 30 %), but this was only statistically significant among children aged 5 – 7 years. The mean number of eggs per gram of faeces (epg) was generally low. Analysis of epg for each species indicated that 7. 8, 7. 60 and 1. 70 % of the subjects had <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> of infections for Ascaris, hookworms and Trichuris, respectively. There was no relationship between intensity of infections and wasting, <b>while</b> children with <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> of infections were more stunted than others.

40|$|Abstract—High-efficiency optical {{emission}} past 1. 3 m of GaInNAs on GaAs, with {{an ultimate}} goal of a high-power 1. 55 - m vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), {{has proven to be}} elusive. While GaInNAs could theoretically be grown lat-tice-matched to GaAs with a very small bandgap [1], wavelengths are actually limited by the N solubility limit and the high In strain limit. By adding Sb to the GaInNAs quaternary, we have observed a remarkable shift toward longer luminescent wavelengths <b>while</b> maintaining <b>high</b> <b>intensity.</b> The increase in strain of these new alloys necessitates the use of tensile strain compensating GaNAs barriers around quantum-well (QW) structures. With the in-corporation of Sb and using In concentrations as high as 40 %, high-intensity photoluminescence (PL) was observed as long as 1. 6 m. PL at 1. 5 m was measured with peak intensity over 50 % of the best 1. 3 m GaInNAs samples grown. Three QW GaIn-NAsSb in-plane lasers were fabricated with room-temperature pulsed operation out to 1. 49 m.

40|$|The mining of {{oil sands}} near Fort McMurray, Alberta, {{involves}} the stripping of salinesadie overburden {{to gain access}} to the oil-bearing formation. The overburden is placed in mined out pits and surface dumps and is re-contoured before being capped with a mandated 1 m soil cover. The potential for slope instability, subsidence, and salinization resulting from the character of the saline-sodic material and its interaction with fresh water makes it imperative that the amount of precipitation percolating below the root zone be minimised. Syncrude Canada Ltd is conducting a large scale cover trial at the Mildred Lake mine in order to assess the performance of different reclamation strategies. Four 1 hectare prototype covers were placed on an area referred to as the SW 30 -Dump in order to study the basic mechanisms controlling moisture movement within the cover systems. Three covers were constructed in 1999 with configurations of 1. 00 m, 0. 50 m and 0. 35 m thick and consisted of a thin layer of peat overlying varying thickness of secondary soil. A fourth study site was established on a recently reclaimed watershed capped with a 1. 00 m cover of peat/secondary mix in 1996. A field instrumentation program was carried out consisting of detailed monitoring of matric suction, volumetric water content and temperature within the different soil profiles, as well as measurements of runoff, interflow and site-specific meteorological conditions. Generally, all instrumentation performed well and was found to correctly measure the soil-atmosphere fluxes required to assess each cover alternative. Evaluation of the covers revealed that the 1 m layered cover was the only one to maintain sufficient soil moisture for all monitored growing seasons. A significant portion of the available soil water was held within the peat layer. The other three covers lacked the required storage during drier periods and on numerous occasions soil suction values exceeded the wilting point for vegetation. Interflow measured from the covers was negligible, <b>while</b> <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> rainfall events and large snow melt events caused preferential flow events in all but the 1 m layered cover. Moisture contents in the shale overburden fluctuated only 1 to 2 percent during the period monitored, indicating nominal percolation into the shale beyond the cover/overburden interface...|$|R
40|$|Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic {{bacteria}} (AAPB), {{which form}} a unique functional group of heterotrophic bacteria, {{have the ability}} to utilize light energy. The impact of carbon source and light intensity on the growth and bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) expression of a typical strain of AAPB, Erythrobacter longus strain DSMZ 6997 was examined during batch culture and continuous culture. The results showed that the expression of BChl a in DSMZ 6997 was regulated by both carbon-source and light conditions, and was stimulated by low availability of carbon but inhibited by light to a certain extent at 300 lx and completely at 1 500 lx. In contrast, cell abundance, and even cell size of this strain, was substantially enhanced under light/dark cycle cultivation conditions over dark conditions, indicating the promotion of growth by light. These results led to the conclusion that utilization of light through BChl a helps AAPB to survive under carbon stress, <b>while</b> light at <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> is harmful to the synthesis of BChl a in AAPB...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRelease of CO 2 {{has caused}} {{significant}} climate change, and {{agricultural land use}} consitutes an important carbon source as well as principal carbon sinks. This paper, by examining carbon functions of main agricultural land in China, shows that in 2000 - 2008 the annual growth rate of carbon emission for arable land amounted to 2. 47 percent, the average annual growth of carbon sinks for forest reached 3. 19 percent, and the diminishing rate of carbon sink for grassland turned to be small but quite distinct. For arable land, higher carbon emissions are mainly located in its central provinces and major agricultural provinces, <b>while</b> <b>higher</b> carbon <b>intensity</b> in its eastern coastal provinces. Agricultural land of 9 provinces in China was found with net carbon emissions, primarily in the agricultural provinces and ecologically fragile urban areas, whereas the other 22 provinces with net carbon sinks. The EKC tests between carbon intensity of agricultural land and agricultural output per capita illustrate a significant inverted Ucurve relationship; as for agricultural output per capita, the inflection point of 9, 615 RMB yuan was surpassed by 11 provinces, mainly in eastern China, developed cities and the northeast region. Finally, policy recommendations are proposed to reduce carbon emissions of agricultural land use across China...|$|R
