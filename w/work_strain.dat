5000|$|The most {{prevailing}} bonding {{theory in}} cold spraying {{is attributed to}} [...] "adiabatic shear instability" [...] which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate {{from the point of}} contact. As a result of this pressure field, a shear load is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where thermal softening is locally dominant over <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and strain rate hardening, which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in viscous flow of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to melting temperature of the material. This material jetting is also a known phenomenon in explosive welding of materials.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} occupational prestige and <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> on mood, the occurrence of interpersonal conflict, and ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate. METHODS: Participants were 50 men and 50 women matched for occupational prestige who were healthy and middle-aged and who completed measures of mood and conflict simultaneously with measures of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate recorded every 30 minutes during waking hours of two workdays and one nonworkday; {{at the end of}} each day, overall ratings were made. <b>Work</b> <b>strain</b> was assessed by the Work Section of the Self-Evaluation and Social Support Interview Schedule. Multiple level random regression coefficients analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Men and women with low-prestige occupations experienced more interpersonal conflict, b = - 0. 03, p =. 04, and higher ambulatory heart rate, b = - 4. 83, p =. 004, throughout the three days of the study. Relative to those with low <b>work</b> <b>strain,</b> those reporting high <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> experienced negative emotion, b = - 0. 41, p <. 0001, and boredom, b = - 0. 17, p <. 0004. End of the day ratings of negative mood were more influenced by <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> among men than among women. No effects of occupational prestige or <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> were obtained for ambulatory blood pressure readings after adjustment for physical activity, posture, and location. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in low-prestige occupations experience greater exposure to interpersonal conflict and arousal as indexed by heart rate, which might increase risk for stress-related illnesses often associated with social class. Individuals who report <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> experience negative mood and boredom, both at work and at home. The absence of work effects on ambulatory blood pressure may be due to the participants being healthy...|$|E

Focus of attention for European countries is directed towards prevention of old age impairment. As considerable time is spent at work, preventative psychosocial work environment measures could be entry points for a healthier ageing. The aims of this study are to i) explore the impact of mid-life <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> on old age disability ii) to examine the independent effects of the <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> components on disability, iii) to analyse the relation between education and disability and whether <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> mediates parts of this association. <b>Work</b> <b>strain</b> and baseline data will be collected from Level of Living Survey (LNU) 1981 and disability data from Swedish Panel Study of Living Conditions of the Oldest Old (SWEOLD) 2004 (n= 626). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that persons in high strain work had the lowest odds of being IADL disabled compared to the passive group. Low demand was not associated to disability, low control group had more than twice the odds of being ADL disabled. Further results indicated that <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> may mediate the association between education and disability. Finally the results support that psychosocial work environment plays a part in the health of individuals at old age...|$|E

GordonAdult Workplace, Aggression, Anger, Coping Strategies, Depression, General Strain TheoryThis study uses General Strain Theory (GST) {{to examine}} why some {{employees}} react to <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> with delinquency {{more frequently than}} other employees. It also examines the role of two conditional variables, perceived situational aggression and emotion management techniques, in assessing the relationship between <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and delinquency. In addition, this study measures two intervening variables, anger and depression, using situational indicators of affect. A survey of 200 employees from the Los Angeles area revealed that both the independent variable of <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> (measured with anger and depression) {{and one of the}} conditional variables, perceived situational aggression, {{have a significant effect on}} delinquency. In contrast, the other conditional variable, emotion management techniques, does not have any significant effect on inhibiting delinquency when employees are exposed to <b>work</b> <b>strain.</b> The findings suggest that GST can be applied to adults as well as adolescents in examining the relationship between strain and delinquency...|$|E
40|$|Background: Physical {{exercise}} during {{leisure time}} {{is known to}} increase physical capacity; however, the long-term effects on work ability and <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> are inconclusive. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of a 6 -month physical exercise program on work ability and <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> after 6 months and 30 months, among women with menopausal symptoms at baseline. Methods: A questionnaire including questions on work ability and <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> was mailed in the beginning, at 6 months and after 30 months after the intervention to occupationally active women participating in a randomized controlled study on physical exercise and quality of life. The intervention included aerobic exercise training 4 times per week, 50 minutes per session. Work ability was measured with the Work Ability Index (WAI) and with questions about physical and mental <b>work</b> <b>strain.</b> Results: Women aged 47 – 62 years (N =  89) who were occupationally active at baseline were included in the analyses. The increase in WAI from baseline to the end of the exercise intervention (6 months) was statistically significantly greater among the intervention group than among the control group (regression coefficient 2. 08; 95 % confidence interval 0. 71 – 3. 46). The difference between the groups persisted for 30 months. No significant short- or long-term effects on physical and mental <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> were found. Conclusion: A 6 -month physical exercise intervention among symptomatic menopausal women had positive short-term as well as long-term effects on work ability...|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} examined {{whether there is}} a direct relationship between attachment orientation and <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> in the finance sector, or whether that relationship is either mediated or moderated by social support from significant others and/or fellow employees. Participants were employed in the finance sector in New Zealand (n= 43) and the United Kingdom (n= 39), and completed a self-report questionnaire that measured adult attachment orientation (Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory), perceived social support from significant others (Quality of Relationship Inventory) perceived social support from work sources (Work Environment Scale) and <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> (Perceived Stress Scale). Mediation or moderation did not hold for either of the potential forms of social support, but significant direct effects were found between Anxiety (a key component of attachment orientation) and <b>work</b> <b>strain,</b> between perceptions of social support from significant others and <b>work</b> <b>strain,</b> and between Anxiety and perceptions of social support from significant others, and between Avoidance and perceptions of social support from significant others.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the moderate role of national culture on the relationship between <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and employee attitudes. National culture describes the context in which <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> is experienced and employee attitudes and intentions are expressed. National culture also influences the perceptions of its members by creating cultural schemata for how experiences are viewed and interpreted. This study considers the attitudes of 347 entry-level employees working in manufacturing and call center companies in China, India, and the Philippines. Our findings indicate the national cultural dimension of long-term orientation moderates the relationships between <b>work</b> <b>strain,</b> job satisfaction, and intention to quit. Isolating national cultural differences related to long-term orientation may aid in the understanding of more subtle cultural variances which may be overlooked when samples from seemingly similar national cultures and geographic regions are grouped for analysis...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and thermophysiological responses of fishermen on the trawl and factory decks of deep-sea vessels. Materials and methods: Twenty-five professional male fishermen (age 39 ± 13 years) were recruited to the study which was performed on three trawlers in the Norwegian Sea in April, June and August 2014. During a six-hour shift, heart rate (HR), core (Tc) and mean skin (Ts) temperatures were recorded, and questions about subjective thermal sensation and comfort were answered. Results: Short periods of hard (above 86 % of HRmax) work raised Tc by 0. 8 °C to 37. 8 °C and decreased Ts by 2. 3 °C to 29. 8 °C during work on the trawl deck, and subjects reported being warm and sweaty. On the factory deck long periods of fairly light (between 52 % and 66 % HRmax) work, Tc of 37. 4 °C and Ts of 30. 9 °C were measured.

40|$|Aims. The aims of {{this study}} were to: (1) compare older people care nursing staff's {{perceptions}} of their competence, <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and work satisfaction in nursing homes and home-based care; and (2) to examine determinants of work satisfaction in both care settings. Background. The shift in older people care from hospitals to community-based facilities and home care has had implications for nursing practice. Lack of competence development, high levels of <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and low levels of work satisfaction among nursing staff in both care settings have been associated with high turnover. Few studies have compared staff perceptions of their competence and work in nursing homes as opposed to home-based care. Design. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Methods. Nursing staff perceptions of their competence, <b>work</b> <b>strain,</b> stress and satisfaction were measured by questionnaire in 2003 in two older people care organizations in Sweden. Comparisons of all outcome variables were made between care settings both within and between the two organizations. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine predictors of work satisfaction in home care and nursing homes respectively. Results. In general, staff in home-based care reported significantly less sufficient knowledge compared with staff in nursing homes. However, home care staff experienced significantly less physical and emotional strain compared with staff in nursing homes. Ratings of work-related exhaustion, mental energy and overall work satisfaction did not differ significantly between care settings. In both care settings, work-related exhaustion was the strongest (inverse) predictor of work satisfaction. Conclusions. Future interventions should focus on counteracting work-related exhaustion and improving competence development to improve work satisfaction among older people care nursing staff in both care settings. Relevance to clinical practice. Work-related exhaustion and lack of competence development may have significant negative implications for work satisfaction among older people care nursing staff in both home care and nursing homes...|$|E

Our aims were to {{investigate}} the sources of <b>work</b> <b>strain</b> and stress, {{and the way in}} which they are experienced by Romanian health professionals in a work context shaped by the ongoing 20 years long reform of the national health care system. Design. An exploratory, qualitative design was used {{to investigate}} medical professionals’ perceptions of stress and <b>work</b> <b>strain.</b> Methods. Twenty eight interviews and two focus groups were conducted with 38 physicians, residents and nurses, between the age of 26 and 53. A semi structured interview guide was used for data gathering and the major themes were identified using thematic analysis of the transcripts. Results. Three themes emerged in the analysis: governance and health system management, scarcity of resources, and health system reputation. Health professionals described the image of a suffering health system, exhausted by an inconsistent management plan, underfunded and understaffed; a system that is a constant source of discontent, bitterness and doubts for them and their patients. Conclusions. Romanian health professionals’ experiences reveal a health care system which after 20 years of reform managed to shape a learned helplessness culture within the medical community and drive a large proportion of its workforce across the borders...|$|E
