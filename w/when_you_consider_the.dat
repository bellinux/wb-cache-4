2500|$|Spaying and neutering — According to a {{study by}} the British Veterinary Association (author AR Michell is the {{president}} of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons), [...] "Neutered females lived longest of dogs dying of all causes, though entire females lived longest of dogs dying of natural causes, with neutered males having the shortest lifespan in each category." [...] Neutering reduces or eliminates the risk of some causes of early death, for example pyometra in females, and testicular cancer in males, as well as indirect causes of early death such as accident and euthanasia (intact dogs roam and tend to be more aggressive), but there might increase the risk of death from other conditions (neutering in cited paper only showed an increase in the risk for prostate cancer but has not been repeated in subsequent papers) in males, and neutered males might have a higher rate for urinary tract cancers such as transitional cell carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Caution should be used when interpreting the results of these studies. This is especially important <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> frequency of transitional cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma in a male dog versus the chance an intact male dog will succumb to death from roaming (hit by car or other injuries), benign hyperplasia of the prostate causing prostatic abscesses or inability to urinate (causing euthanasia if this does not resolve with therapy) or euthanasia due to fighting or aggression.|$|E
2500|$|Denisof complimented {{the season}} three Angel episode [...] "Billy", in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after {{becoming}} supernaturally misogynous, [...] "because {{it was the}} first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with". Discussing Wesley's betrayal of his friends to protect Angel's baby, Denisof explains, It isn't that he's purely bad or purely good, we're discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren't as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he thinks, for the good of all [...] i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son [...] and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it's grey rather than black or white. Science fiction magazine Starburst said that [...] "somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley". Denisof says of the period, [...] "It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character's darker layers. You couldn't have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters." [...] Whilst the character spent less time with his old friends, Denisof was [...] "more or less isolated from the , barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we'd chew each other out. There's definitely a cold war going on with Wesley versus the world." [...] Wesley's dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram & Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because [...] "we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And we had to put our differences behind us and build our trust again as a group." [...] Discussing the way Wesley's English accent softens over the course of Angel, Denisof says, [...] just sits on him better. As an actor, it just felt that organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> amount of time he's spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn't surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it's understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, {{as a result of his}} environment.|$|E
