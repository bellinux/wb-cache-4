40|$|AbstractResearchers have {{developed}} forensic analysis techniques {{for so many}} types of digital media {{that there is a}} procedure for almost every digital media that a law enforcement officer may encounter at a crime scene. However, a new type of device has started to gain momentum in the consumer market: <b>web</b> <b>thin</b> clients. These <b>web</b> <b>thin</b> clients are characterized by native support for basic web browsing, yet other functionality relies on a combination of web applications and web storage. In fact, these devices are so different from other types of computing and storage devices that virtually all of the techniques forensic examiners and researchers typically use do not apply. The most popular <b>web</b> <b>thin</b> client, Chrome OS, has additional forensic challenges: (1) all data associated with users is encrypted, (2) Chrome OS correctly uses TPM and Secure Boot, and (3) user data is stored on the device and in the cloud. In this work, we present a novel approach to extract residual evidence stored on Chrome OS devices that successfully bypasses these challenges. Specifically, we are able to determine which extensions and apps are installed on an encrypted Chrome OS device, without breaking or otherwise extracting the encryption keys. Our framework, called dbling, generates signatures or fingerprints of extension and app code that persist after encryption, and we are able to use these fingerprints to identify the installed extensions and apps. We create fingerprints of 160, 025 extensions for Chrome OS, we measure the uniqueness of these fingerprints, and we perform a case study by installing 14 extensions on a Chrome OS device and attempt to find their fingerprints...|$|R

40|$|Trapezoid {{web beam}} {{is a type}} of steel I-section in which the web is made {{corrugated}} in a trapezoidal profile form. The corrugated <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> is continuously welded to the flanges along the top and bottom edges. Trapezoid web beam is a built up section that able to support vertical loads over long spans. The higher bending capacity is achieved by increasing the depth of the section. Increasing the depth will increase the slenderness of web and hence reducing the shear buckling capacity. Ordinarily, the economic design of steel <b>web</b> I-beam requires <b>thin</b> <b>web.</b> To avoid shear buckling, intermediate stiffener has to be used, or alternatively, the web can be made corrugated in trapezoidal profile. When beams with corrugated webs are compared with those with stiffened flat webs, it can be found that trapezoidal corrugation in the web enables the use of <b>thinner</b> <b>webs</b> and trapezoidal web beams eliminate costly web stiffener...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the fatigue behavior of <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girders. The investigation was directed primarily toward the determination of the effects of flange rigidity and vertical stiffener rigidity on the fatigue behavior of individual panels of <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girders. A considerable amount of attention was also devoted to the initial lateral web deflections in the webs of the girders. A qualitative ana 1 ysis was made of the fatigue behavior of individual <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girder panels with initial lateral web deflections. Two types of loading were considered: pure shear and combined shear and bending. The analysis was based on theoretical and experimental data on the post buckling behavior of girder web panels which {{have been reported in the}} literature. In the experimental part of the investigation twenty fatigue tests were conducted on scale model <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> all-welded girders. Fifteen of these tests were conducted on girders in which the only geometric variab 1 e was the size of the flanges. Nine of the fifteen tests were carried out under conditions approximating pure shear and the remaining six tests were conducted under the condition of combined shear and flexure. Five additional tests were completed on girders in which the only variable was the rigidity of the vertica 1 stiffeners. The investigation revealed the manner in which <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girder panels fail in fatigue. The effects of flange rigidity and vertical stiffener rigidity on fatigue life were determined and recommendations were made with regard to minimum desirable flange rigidities. Finally, it was shown that initial lateral web deflections have an effect on the fatigue behavior of <b>thin</b> <b>web</b> girders...|$|R

40|$|Plate girder structure, {{which is}} {{constructed}} from welded steel plate, is well recognized. Economical design of girders and beams normally requires <b>thin</b> <b>webs.</b> But if the <b>web</b> is extremely <b>thin</b> {{the problem of}} plate buckling may arise. Possible ways to reduce this risk consist of using thicker plates, web stiffeners or strengthening the web by making it corrugation. The conventional provision of stiffeners to allow the use of <b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> has two disadvantages, i. e. high fabrication cost and a possible reduced life due to fatigue cracking that may initiate at them stiffener weld. The use of corrugated plates (Fig. 1. 1) to replace the flat stiffened plates as the web can eliminate both disadvantages. The uses of corrugated webs have been increasingly used in many diverse engineering structures from structural engineering to aerospace and marine engineering. The corrugation of the webs acts as transverse stiffeners that allows {{for the use of}} thin plates. Because of the high slenderness ratio, web stability against shear buckling is of prime importance...|$|R

For achieving aggressive weight targets, pockets are always designed by <b>thin</b> walls and <b>webs.</b> When machining a pocket, the web is created at the face of the end mill, as opposed to ribs, which are created at the periphery of the end mill. However, difficulty exists for control the thickness tolerance when machining these thin-webs.

40|$|Whereas {{the first}} OLED {{lighting}} product was already introduced in 2008 by Ingo Maurer and Osram the market penetration of OLED lighting is still low. This is {{mainly caused by}} the huge progress in inorganic LED technology. LED-based lighting products have been available for some years and are {{the basis for a}} rapidly growing SSL industry. Therefore it is necessary to identify the unique selling points for OLED.

40|$|Steel plate girders of {{bridges and}} {{industrial}} structures are usually subjected to dynamic fatigue loading.

The consequence of {{that can be}} arising and successive development of fatigue cracks along the welded connections of the <b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> with flanges and stiffeners. Therefore, the fatigue strength and life/time of thin-walled plate girders depend beside of usual material-technological and structural influences also on stability aspects. Basic knowledge about fatigue failure mechanisms of thin-walled hybrid plate girders is presented with the regard for their local stability, obtained and by theoretical an experimental analyses. The outcome of obtained results is that the fatigue consequences of <b>thin</b> <b>webs</b> vibration can be effectively reduced by appropriate reduction of their slenderness. Therefore, the empirical formula for the limitation of web slenderness has been proposed and recommended for plate girders subjected to dynamic fatigue loading...|$|R
