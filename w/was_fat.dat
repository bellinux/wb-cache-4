500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I <b>was</b> <b>fat</b> and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role." ...|$|E

50|$|In geometry, a <b>fat</b> object <b>is</b> {{an object}} in two or more dimensions, whose lengths in the {{different}} dimensions are similar. For example, a square <b>is</b> <b>fat</b> because its length and width are identical. A 2-by-1 rectangle is thinner than a square, but it <b>is</b> <b>fat</b> relative to a 10-by-1 rectangle. Similarly, a circle <b>is</b> <b>fatter</b> than a 1-by-10 ellipse and an equilateral triangle <b>is</b> <b>fatter</b> than a very obtuse triangle.|$|R

500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I <b>was</b> <b>fat,</b> and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

I always tried to be funny {{to make up for the}} fact that I <b>was</b> <b>fat</b> and ugly." [...] As a teenager, Ekland left school to travel with a theater company, and was spotted by a talent agent in a coffee shop while in Italy, who sent her to London to audition for films.|$|E
2500|$|Fat Joe {{released}} his fourth album Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.) in 2001, featuring production from the then-popular Irv Gotti. The album featured a star-studded lineup {{from the likes}} of Ashanti, Ja Rule, N.O.R.E., Busta Rhymes, Petey Pablo, M.O.P., Ludacris, R. Kelly, Buju Banton, and artists from his Terror Squad label. The lead single [...] "We Thuggin'" [...] featuring R. Kelly was a big hit in late 2001, but would not reach the level of the Irv Gotti-produced [...] "What's Luv?" [...] which was a massive hit in early 2002 and featured The Inc. superstars Ja Rule and Ashanti. The album <b>was</b> <b>Fat</b> Joe's biggest hit as it was successful from its January release all the way into May, being certified platinum. However, Fat Joe's fifth album Loyalty, released later in 2002 and featuring production from Irv Gotti, was not as successful.|$|E

[...] I was tall, stocky, and they wanted me on the {{football}} team. Also, I was never ostracized as weird just because I was a film geek, because my parents would come to school and show 16mm films, or teach leatherworking and jewelry classes, which all the kids thought was cool[...] [...] [...] It {{never occurred to me}} that I <b>was</b> <b>fat</b> until the fifth grade, when a new kid at school started causing problems. [...] That's when Dad showed me José Ferrer as Cyrano de Bergerac; when someone hurls an insult at him, he says, 'Is that all? Ah, no, young sir, you're too simple. [...] You might have said a great many things. [...] Why waste your opportunity?' And then he names a score better than himself. Or Cocteau's La Belle et la Bête (Beauty and the Beast).

2500|$|The episode has {{received}} negative reviews from critics. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a negative review saying [...] "After two pretty good shows, Season 12 encounters mediocrity with “Poppy”. At no point does the program become poor, {{but it just}} lacks many real laughs. Outside of some amusing book fair cameos, this one fails to deliver much zing, and it tends to drag."Mark Naglazas of The West Australian called the episode [...] "disappointing". He remarked that it and [...] "A Tale of Two Springfields" [...] (which premiered the same night in Australia) were [...] "so surreal they would have Salvador Dalí scratching his head". However, he identified John Updike's guest appearance {{as an example of}} [...] "sophisticated comedy". The Daily Telegraph said, [...] "The episode gets lost in a quagmire of guest stars. The names range from the sublime to the ridiculous, or to be exact, from Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Updike to actor Drew Barrymore. The script seems designed only to fit in as many big names as possible. Oh for the days when it was the other way round and guest stars fitted in with the script."

40|$|The {{objective}} was {{to test the hypothesis}} that traditional and novel cardiometabolic risk factors would be significantly different in groups of men of different fatness and fitness. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6, interleukin- 10, fibrinogen, and insulin resistance were assessed in 183 nonsmoking white men aged 35 to 53 years, including 62 who were slim and fit (waist girth ≤ 90 cm and maximal oxygen consumption [VO(2) max] above average), 24 who were slim and unfit (waist girth ≤ 90 cm and VO(2) max average or below), 39 who <b>were</b> <b>fat</b> and fit (waist girth ≥ 100 cm and VO(2) max above average), and 19 who <b>were</b> <b>fat</b> and unfit (waist girth ≥ 100 cm and VO(2) max average or below). Seventy-six percent gave blood on 2 occasions, and the average of 1 or 2 blood tests was used in statistical tests. Waist girth (centimeters) and fitness (milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of fat-free mass) were associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, leptin, and insulin resistance after adjustment for age, saturated fat intake, and total energy intake. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, and insulin resistance were significantly different in men who <b>were</b> <b>fat</b> and fit and those who <b>were</b> <b>fat</b> and unfit. These data suggest that differences in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, liver function, and insulin resistance may explain why the risks of chronic disease are lower in men who <b>are</b> <b>fat</b> and fit than those who <b>are</b> <b>fat</b> and unfit...|$|R
