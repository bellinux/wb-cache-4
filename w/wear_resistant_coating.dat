5000|$|Plasma {{transferred}} wire arc (PTWA) {{is another}} form of wire arc spray which deposits a coating on the internal surface of a cylinder, or on the external surface of a part of any geometry. It is predominantly known for its use in coating the cylinder bores of an engine, enabling the use of Aluminum engine blocks {{without the need for}} heavy cast iron sleeves. A single conductive wire is used as [...] "feedstock" [...] for the system. A supersonic plasma jet melts the wire, atomizes it and propels it onto the substrate. The plasma jet is formed by a transferred arc between a non-consumable cathode and the type of a wire. After atomization, forced air transports the stream of molten droplets onto the bore wall. The particles flatten when they impinge {{on the surface of the}} substrate, due to the high kinetic energy. The particles rapidly solidify upon contact. The stacked particles make up a high <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>coating.</b> The PTWA thermal spray process utilizes a single wire as the feedstock material. All conductive wires up to and including 0.0625" [...] (1.6mm) can be used as feedstock material, including [...] "cored" [...] wires. PTWA can be used to apply a coating to the wear surface of engine or transmission components to replace a bushing or bearing. For example, using PTWA to coat the bearing surface of a connecting rod offers a number of benefits including reductions in weight, cost, friction potential, and stress in the connecting rod.|$|E

40|$|Friction {{and wear}} are not desired for many applications. One way to {{diminish}} the wear of a component is to coat it by Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) with a thin, <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> hard <b>coating.</b> This approach has proved very successful for the past decades. Although increasing the wear resistance and thus the lifetime of the coated components, almost all <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> coatings used in industry nowadays do not solve {{the problems associated with}} friction, e. g. excessive heating, high energy losses, etc. Lubrication with various liquid and solid lubricants has been known to be a good solution to these problems for millennia. However, nowadays environmental and technical requirements reduce more and more the fields of application of the above mentioned lubrication methods. Therefore, it would be very beneficial for industry if high hardness, wear resistance and lubricating properties can be all combined in a coating. Thus both friction and wear problems will be diminished without the need to use external lubrication. In this work an effort is made to design a group of such PVD coatings by mixing doping a hard, <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> phase (TiN) with a well-known solid lubricant (MoS 2). The mixing is made by sequential deposition of thin layers of both phases in order to realize a multilayer TiN/MoS 2 structure and by co-deposition of both components in order to realize mixed-phase TiN+MoS 2 coatings. The influence of the deposition conditions on the structure and the tribological and mechanical properties of the above mentioned coating architectures is studied.

The stainless steel substrate with ceramic coating has a higher erosion resistance than the uncoated specimen because the mixed powder changes to a glass-coating in the high temperature heat treatment, and a few mullite are formed. Mullite has the high hardness value that makes the hardness of the coating increased.
