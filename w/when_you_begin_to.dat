60|$|She. Ah! Can {{you give}} me all I've asked for not now, nor a few months later, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> think of what you might have done if you had kept your own {{appointment}} and your caste here <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> look upon me as a drag and a burden? I shall want it most then, Guy, for {{there will be no}} one in the wide world but you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do—I {{was only}} {{thinking}} what an extravagant mortal you are <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> buy. You know you mustn't keep on always——" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, in the end," [...] {{answers the}} House. [...] "That is <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> understand, you men and women, {{when you come}} to the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Capital, sir, capital," [...] said Joe Bevan. [...] "I {{wanted to}} see whether you would lay down or not <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> get a few punches. You did capitally, Mr Sheen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Either your {{not writing}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were very ill, or {{the change in}} your {{handwriting}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be better, created some suspicion of the truth; however that is--but you're sure you'll not be the worse for any news, if it's not bad news?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well no, Squire--that is, I had a rare hunt after him, and I {{had just}} {{happened}} of him up a tree <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> halloa so loud, that he went nigh to falling out of it, so I {{had to tell him}} to come back next week, or the week after." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{am telling}} the story, not you, Jeanne," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "Some day <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> talk English quite well you shall give your version of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite old-fashioned now to groan <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> speak: This is {{the newest}} thing in tone--" [...] And here (it chilled me to the bone) He gave an AWFUL squeak.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Westgate, {{more and}} more exhilarated by her own scheme, {{irradiated}} interest. “If I could only believe it was safe! But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> pity him I, on my side, am afraid.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} asked you," [...] she went on, [...] "to tell {{me exactly what}} {{happened}} behind there. I don't want to know. Only I have a consciousness--I had from the first, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{talk to me about}} it--that your fears were exaggerated. If you have been allowed to remain safe all this time, you will be safe always. I feel it, and I am always right in these things. Now use your own common sense. Tell me truthfully, don't you think it is very improbable that anything could be discovered?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet at one {{period in}} the proceedings," [...] said Smith, [...] "I fancied that your head would come unglued at the neck. But the fear was merely transient. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> get going, why, then I felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken, or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes {{he stared at the}} Pacific." ...|$|R
6000|$|Allonby nodded. [...] "New Mexico, Arizona, {{or somewhere}} there. Now, just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> listen, there's Mr. Torrance wanting me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” Aynsley said slowly, “if we {{give way}} in this, I dare say they’d find {{something}} else to make trouble about. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> make concessions you generally have to go on.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... [211] The use of {{acquiring}} this habit of execution {{is that you}} may be able, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> colour, to let one hue be seen in minute portions, gleaming between the touches of another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> collect orchids. I'm not mad, really, except perhaps on this point, Mr. Quatermain,"--this {{in a low}} and thrilling voice--"that marvellous Cypripedium--your friend is right, it is a Cypripedium--is worth a gold mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{you were}} talking in your sleep, you kept mumbling {{something}} about [...] "matches," [...] which I couldn't make anything out of; but just now, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{tell me about the}} man and the calaboose and the matches, I remembered that in your sleep you mentioned Ben Coontz two or three times; so I put this and that together, you see, and right away I knew it was Ben that burnt that man up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet at one {{period in}} the proceedings, Comrade Brady," [...] said Psmith, [...] "I fancied that your head would come unglued at the neck. But the fear was merely transient. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{administer}} those--am I correct in saying?--half-scissor hooks to the body, why, then I felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken; or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes {{he stared at the}} Pacific." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] {{answered}} Taminah {{in a low}} voice; [...] "sometimes {{the spirit}} lingers close to a sleeping body and may hear. I spoke {{a long time before}} I touched you, and I spoke softly for fear it would depart at a sudden noise and leave you sleeping for ever. I took you by the shoulder only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> mutter words I could not understand. Have you not heard, then, and do you know nothing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I try to be, but I {{very often}} fail; so every Sunday I make new resolutions, {{and work hard}} to keep them through the week. That is a great help, as you will find <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> try it." ...|$|E
6000|$|S. [...] "Dear boy, {{you seem}} to wish that I should, as usual, put you off with a myth, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> ask me about those who know far more about me than I do about them. Nevertheless, shall I tell you a myth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Charlie! how can {{you talk}} of it?" [...] said Mrs Brooke, with a distressed look. [...] "I have {{scarcely}} had time to realise {{the fact that you}} have come home, and to thank God for it, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> talk of leaving me again--perhaps for years, as before." ...|$|E
6000|$|With a wistful glance R. W. said, {{in default}} of having {{anything}} better to say: 'About <b>when</b> did <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> feel it coming on, my dear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Drunk {{on his own}} chivalry, Ashurst went on murmuring, [...] "It's I who am {{not good}} enough for <b>you.</b> Oh! Megan, <b>when</b> did <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> love me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Curse your honesty! [...] . Is {{there any}} honesty in all this! [...] . <b>When</b> did <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> be honest? Why are you here? What are you now? [...] . Still honest? [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you {{are getting}} on to your high horse, and you know I always {{go out of the}} way <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> prance on that beast. As for me, I don't want to leave papa's house where I'm sure of my bread and butter, till I'm sure of it in another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Presentable?--oh, very well. You wouldn't see any difference," [...] Captain Crawley answered. [...] "Do let's have him, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> {{see a few}} people; and his whatdyecallem--his inamorato--eh, Miss Sharp; that's {{what you}} call it--comes. Gad, I'll write him a note, and have him; and I'll try if he can play piquet as well as billiards. Where does he live, Miss Sharp?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctor," [...] I said, [...] "you {{are going}} to invent {{authorities}} now and I'll leave you, too. I always enjoy your conversation, notwithstanding the luxuriance of your syllables, when the philosophy you offer rests on your own responsibility; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> soar--when you begin to support it with the evidence of authorities who are the creations of your own fancy--I lose confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{never said}} a word. I was merely sitting here, being sweetly lured on by {{promises}} of peace on earth {{and all the rest}} of it, <b>when</b> suddenly <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> call me names." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It will {{certainly}} be a magnificent structure,' said the creditor, after regarding the elevations through his spectacles. 'Stancy Castle: I {{had no idea of}} it! and <b>when</b> do <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> build, Mr. Havill?' he inquired in mollified tones.|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{things are}} very disturbing," [...] said Psmith, {{when they were in}} the train. [...] "Dignity is {{impossible}} when one is compelled to be the Hunted Fawn. <b>When</b> did <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> suspect that yonder merchant was doing the sleuth-hound act?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{wants to}} draw your arms--of course {{you will be}} {{only too happy to}} let him--you can't {{understand}} anything about it now--but you will <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> sit--pass the cigars--thank Blyth for meaning to make a Hercules of you-and tell him you'll come to the painting-room whenever he likes," [...] answered Zack, joining his sentences together in his most offhand manner, all in a breath.|$|E
60|$|SHE. Ah! Can {{you give}} me all I've asked for--not now, nor a few months later, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> think of what you might have done if you had kept your own {{appointment}} and your caste here--when you begin to look upon me as a drag and a burden? I shall want it most, then, Guy, for {{there will be no}} one in the wide world but you.|$|E
6000|$|... 176. Next, {{respecting}} general tone. I said, just now, that, for {{the sake}} of students, my tax should not be laid on black or on white pigments; but if you mean to be a colorist, you must lay a tax on them yourself <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> use true color; that is to say, you must use them little, and make of them much. There is no better test of your color tones being good, than your having made the white in your picture precious, and the black conspicuous.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's my idee to a dot, lad, an' I'm tryin' {{to think}} up {{some kind of a}} plan so that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> figger, I can put in my oar with some show of sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is over, you do him justice now,' said Amy. 'You did, indeed you did, {{make him}} quite happy. He said so, again and again. I {{never saw him}} so happy as <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> get better. I don't think any one ever had so much {{happiness}} and it never ceased, it was all quiet, and peace, and joy, till it brightened quite into perfect day--and the angel's song! Don't you remember yesterday, how clear and sweet his voice came out in that? {{and it was the}} last thing almost he said. I believe'--she lowered her voice--'I believe he finished it among them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DUDGEON. My heart! My heart! And since <b>when,</b> pray, have <b>you</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> hold up {{our hearts}} as {{trustworthy}} guides for us? ...|$|R
