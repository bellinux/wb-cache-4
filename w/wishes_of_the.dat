The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family.|$|E

5|$|During their conquests, the Crusaders {{established}} the Latin Rite crusader {{states of the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem, the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the County of Edessa. This was contrary to the <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Rite Byzantines, who wanted the land that the Muslims took from them returned, rather than occupied by Latin Catholics. After the retaking of Jerusalem, most of the crusaders returned home. This left the crusader kingdoms vulnerable from Muslim reconquests during the Second and Third Crusades.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416–415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos {{on one side and}} Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders.|$|E
5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E

5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override the <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King {{if he had been}} declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E
5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against the <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain {{made it clear that}} gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, Germany and Italy were {{becoming}} more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European powers. Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland, {{an area of}} Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population; and soon Britain and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against the <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czechoslovak government, {{in exchange for a}} promise of no further territorial demands. Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's Zaolzie region.|$|E

Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela {{was elected to the}} executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe.

5|$|Later, Bilac {{escapes from}} the room {{in which he is}} being held without exiting through the only door. Mulder notices a large drag mark through the dust on the floor, {{discovering}} a hatch leading to the museum's old steam tunnels. While exploring the tunnels, the agents find the remains of the victims and are attacked by a multitude of feral cats. As they try to escape, they come across Bilac's mutilated body. The two agents make their way out and close the hatch on the pursuing cats. The episode closes with Mulder suspecting that the animal attacks were associated with the burial urn that had been removed against the <b>wishes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ecuadorian tribespeople; it is shortly returned to the burial grounds, where the local shaman watches the urn's reburial with jaguar-like eyes.|$|E

French, Italian and Spanish troops landed in Montevideo at Villalba's request to dissuade the radical Blancos from attempting a coup to retake power. Villalba entered into talks with Flores and Paranhos. With the Italian resident minister Raffaele Ulisse Barbolani serving as intermediary, an agreement was reached. Flores and Manuel Herrera y Obes (representing Villalba's government) signed a peace accord on 20 February at the Villa de la Unión. A general amnesty was granted to both Blancos and Colorados, and Villalba handed over the presidency to Flores on an interim basis until elections could be held.|$|E

Newspapers connected to political enemies of his family took advantage of this disagreement to level serious, but unfounded, accusations against him, including that he had kidnapped Ana Luísa. Despite the invective, their marriage was a happy one and three children resulted: Luísa de Loreto Viana de Lima, Ana de Loreto Viana de Lima and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, born in 1833, 1836 and 1847, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Assistance in {{childbirth}} differed in various cultural communities and historical periods. However, childbirth {{was always a}} family matter in which father participated either directly or indirectly. The last ten years revealed that <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> a man was absolutely irreplaceable {{in the relationship between}} mother, a new-born child and father, and that the role reflected itself in the relationship not only with mother [...] the mate but also with the child. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bachelor thesis was to ascertain to what extent the father's attendance to the childbirth was a spontaneous <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> parents, and to what extent it was rather a <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman in childbed. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> my own experience, the following hypothesis was determined: "Fathers attendance to the childbirth is predominantly a spontaneous <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> parents. In order to verify the hypothesis, I used <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a quantitative research. The data were collected using the questionnaire containing 16 questions for mothers and 16 questions for fathers. The questions for both <b>the</b> groups <b>of</b> informants were identical. The questionnaire was anonymous. The research group consisted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mothers giving birth to their child in the hospital in České Budějovice (a joint stock company) and their mates attending to the childbirth. The research group comprised 56 pairs <b>of</b> informants. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis reveal that the mates attendance to the childbirth is largely a spontaneous <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parents-to-be. It is obvious that as early as during the pregnancy the fathers-to-be search for the information on gravidity and childbirth. They enjoy the pregnancy together with their mates and do not assume an uninterested attitude to <b>the</b> gravidity <b>of</b> their mates. Active preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pairs for the childbirth is also apparent. Assessment of negatives and positives of fathers attendance to the childbirth is subjective and very individual. If the mates attendance to the childbirth is a common <b>wish</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> parents-to-be, <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> their child is an invaluable experience in their life...|$|R

After a brief transition under the Provisional Government, the oligarchical Republic of Hawaii was established on July4, 1894, with Sanford B. Dole as president.
