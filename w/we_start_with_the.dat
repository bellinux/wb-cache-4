500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of}} the game say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

The basic generic balance expression states that dΘ/dt, i.e. {{the rate of change}} of Θ in the system, equals the rate at which Θ enters the system at the boundaries, minus the rate at which Θ leaves the system across the system boundaries, plus the rate at which Θ is generated within the system.

2500|$|In {{the case}} when the disk alone spins there is no change in flux through the circuit, however, there is an {{electromotive}} force induced contrary to Faraday's law. We can also show an example {{when there is a}} change in flux, but no induced voltage. Figure 5 (near right) shows the setup used in Tilley's experiment. It is a circuit with two loops or meshes. There is a galvanometer connected in the right-hand loop, a magnet {{in the center of the}} left-hand loop, a switch in the left-hand loop, and a switch between the loops. <b>We</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> switch on the left open and that on the right closed. When the switch on the left is closed and the switch on the right is open there is no change in the field of the magnet, but there is a change in the area of the galvanometer circuit. This means that there is a change in flux. However the galvanometer did not deflect meaning there was no induced voltage, and Faraday's law does not work in this case. According to A. G. Kelly this suggests that an induced voltage in Faraday's experiment is due to the [...] "cutting" [...] of the circuit by the flux lines, and not by [...] "flux linking" [...] or the actual change in flux. This follows from the Tilley experiment because there is no movement of the lines of force across the circuit and therefore no current induced although there is a change in flux through the circuit. Nussbaum suggests that for Faraday's law to be valid, work must be done in producing the change in flux.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is worth}} while to dwell upon this {{preliminary}} {{point of the}} ground of Browning's obscurity, because it involves an important issue about him. Our whole view of Browning {{is bound to be}} absolutely different, and I think absolutely false, if <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conception that he was what the French call an intellectual. If we see Browning with the eyes of his particular followers, we shall inevitably think this. For his followers are pre-eminently intellectuals, and there never lived upon the earth a great man who was so fundamentally different from his followers. Indeed, he felt this heartily and even humorously himself. [...] "Wilkes was no Wilkite," [...] he said, [...] "and I am very far from being a Browningite." [...] We shall, as I say, utterly misunderstand Browning at every step of his career if we suppose that he was the sort of man who would be likely to take a pleasure in asserting the subtlety and abstruseness of his message. He took pleasure beyond all question in himself; in the strictest sense of the word he enjoyed himself. But his conception of himself was never that of the intellectual. He conceived himself rather as a sanguine and strenuous man, a great fighter. [...] "I was ever," [...] as he says, [...] "a fighter." [...] His faults, a certain occasional fierceness and grossness, were the faults that are counted as virtues among navvies and sailors and most primitive men. His virtues, boyishness and absolute fidelity, and a love of plain words and things are the virtues which are counted as vices among the æsthetic prigs who pay him the greatest honour. He had his more objectionable side, like other men, but {{it had nothing to do}} with literary egotism. He was not vain of being an extraordinary man. He was only somewhat excessively vain of being an ordinary one.|$|E
