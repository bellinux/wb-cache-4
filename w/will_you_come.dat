500|$|In April 1965, {{with only}} {{eighteen}} months left of Speer's sentence, Wolters wrote to him of their prospective reunion, [...] "t {{will have been}} twenty years since I saw you last. [...] What will there be between us old codgers, aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in the long distant past ... <b>Will</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to me mainly to take receipt of the promised gift I have held for you in our cellarâ€”that long cured Westphalian ham, and those patiently waiting bottles of your favorite nectar: Johannisberger 1937? [...] Could these things of the senses end up being all that there is between us? [...] I am so happy that the moment approaches, but my heart is heavy..." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> with me", and lamenting {{the fact that}} she laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The first movement, an aria, {{begins with}} an {{expressive}} melody of the obbligato oboe which is {{picked up by the}} voice on the words [...] (I have enough). The beginning upward leap of a minor sixth is reminiscent of the aria [...] (Have mercy) in Bach's St Matthew Passion and the aria [...] (When <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>come,</b> my salvation?) from [...] The first motif is changed to a phrase that appears at the end of three vocal sections. A similar motif begins the middle section on the words [...] (I have seen him), turning upwards in the end. Klaus Hofmann notes a [...] "feeling of serene contentedness with life" [...] in [...] "elegiac tones" [...] as the aria's expression. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes [...] "that instant when body and soul come to rest and are resigned and in complete harmony. Bach encapsulates this experience of peace and acquiescent submission beyond anything that mere words can convey." [...] He sees the [...] "flowing oboe arabesques", which the singer imitates twice on the word [...] (joy) as a [...] "clear indication that their expressive function is to proclaim the Christian's personal bliss, an inextricable element of this important experience of life".|$|E
