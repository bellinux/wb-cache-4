Oleg died, thus {{fulfilling}} the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the motivations}} for Equatorial Guinea's {{membership}} pursuit into the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) included access to several professional and academic exchange {{programs and the}} facilitate cross-border circulation of citizens. The adoption of Portuguese as an official language was the primary requirement to apply for CPLP acceptance. In addition, the country <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> has to adopt political reforms allowing for effective democracy and the respect for human rights. The national parliament discussed this law in October 2011.|$|E

25|$|From 1950, India ran {{continued}} {{trade deficits}} that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem {{and could not}} borrow money from abroad or from the private corporate sector, due to that sector's negative savings rate. As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which had hitherto been {{a key factor in}} preventing devaluation of the rupee, was finally cut off and India <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Furthermore, The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated more devaluation. Defense spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of total expenditure, the highest {{it has been in the}} period from 1965 to 1989 (Foundations, pp 195). Another factor leading to devaluation was the drought of 1965/1966 which resulted in a sharp rise in prices.|$|E

On August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party. Barr's running mate, Cindy Sheehan, immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee Jill Stein, leading Sheehan to request her name taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> {{was too late to}} have her name removed, so she instead announced that she was simply leaving the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Intellectuals {{regularly}} {{found themselves}} in the Marshalsea.

The poet Christopher Brooke was jailed in 1601 for helping 17-year-old Ann More marry John Donne without her father's consent. George Wither, the political satirist, wrote his poem [...] "The Shepherd's Hunting" [...] in 1614 in the Marshalsea; he was held for four months for libel over his Abuses Stript and Whipt, 20 satires criticizing revenge, ambition and lust, one of them directed at the Lord Chancellor.|$|E

[...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game. We won the Premiership title with a strong run {{at the end of}} last season." [...] Howard was unsure whether he would displace Barthez in the first team for a prolonged run – [...] "that's not my decision", though continued [...] "We have four great goalkeepers and we're looking to have a good battle all season long." ...|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{continued}} his provocative approach to journalism, and {{on more than}} one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the Lebanon War, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Bradby, then the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "disrespectful". Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking a difficult question on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from the main issue of the conference, but he argued that [...] "I'm paid to ask questions... particularly at a time when there are incredibly serious allegations... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions." [...] Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup [...] "stage management", and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions.|$|E
500|$|Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then {{staying at}} the Gatehouse Prison, {{although}} still not charged with any crime. [...] Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. [...] Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. [...] She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that [...] "particular persons only" [...] were allowed to visit. [...] Hall was again questioned on 7March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. [...] When asked why she had lied to the court, she said [...] "when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> was not the truth. [...] I was terrified and threatened {{to be sent to}} Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth." [...] She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of the things about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.|$|E
500|$|With {{the success}} of Resident Evil 2 in 1998, Capcom began more Resident Evil {{projects}} across multiple consoles. Code: Veronica originated from an unsuccessful attempt to port Resident Evil 2 to the Sega Saturn. After producer Shinji Mikami and his team learned they {{would be unable to}} port the game without making a large sacrifice to quality, Mikami was asked by his leadership to create something else for Sega fans, and so development began on an original game. When Mikami asked for more time to develop the game, he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> would need to have a better technical quality, making Sega's upcoming Dreamcast more appealing. Around the same time, a side-story game for the PlayStation starring Jill Valentine in the events leading up to Resident Evil 2 was being developed. This title was originally intended to be a spin-off with the Dreamcast title to be the true sequel. According to IGN, Sony bartered for limited exclusivity on the [...] "Resident Evil 3" [...] title, and thus the side-story was branded as [...] and the true sequel was labeled a spin-off and later titled Code: Veronica. This notion is conflicted by interviews at the time, as producer Shinji Mikami and Flagship president Yoshiki Okamoto told journalists they wanted to keep the numbered chronology on the PlayStation systems, and give subtitles to Resident Evil games on all other systems. Regardless, the game content remained essentially unchanged.|$|E

500|$|As Moe's {{voice is}} based on Al Pacino's, {{likewise}} many of Azaria's other recurring characters are based on existing sources. He took Apu's voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party. Originally, {{it was thought that}} Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped, but after Azaria's reading of the line [...] "Hello, Mr. Homer", which the show's producers thought was hilarious, the character stayed. Azaria, however, disputed this on LateNet with Ray Ellin, claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical. Chief Wiggum's voice was originally a parody of David Brinkley, but when Azaria <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> was too slow, he switched it to that of Edward G. Robinson. Officer Lou {{is based on}} Sylvester Stallone, and Dr. Nick is [...] "a bad Ricky Ricardo impression." [...] The [...] "Wise Guy" [...] voice is [...] "basically Charles Bronson," [...] while Carl is [...] "a silly voice [...] always did." [...] Two of the voices come from his time at college: Snake's is based on Azaria's old college roommate, while Comic Book Guy's voice is based on a student who lived in the room next door to Azaria and went by the name [...] "F". Professor Frink is based on Jerry Lewis' performance in the original The Nutty Professor, and the Sea Captain is based on English actor Robert Newton's portrayal of many pirates. Azaria based his performance for the one-time character Frank Grimes, from the episode [...] "Homer's Enemy", on actor William H. Macy. He counts Grimes as the hardest, most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked {{a number of questions}} about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, though he did not object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, so much more than for the state coins; Walsh responded that it was because the coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. [...] Gard followed up this point, asking {{if it had been a}} 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative John Franklin Miller asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman James W. Dunbar of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint might be out of pocket in striking the coins, and asked if the federal government would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>it</b> had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than ordinary half dollars to which Walsh replied, [...] "why, I think very likely, especially on Cape Cod." [...] Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.|$|E
