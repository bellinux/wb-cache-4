Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred <b>will</b> <b>step</b> forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects...

25|$|Depending {{upon the}} path of the ball, the batsman will either move forward or back in his attempt to {{intercept}} it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backwards movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batsman <b>will</b> <b>step</b> forward towards the ball, bending his front knee to bring his bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forwards, the batsman is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batsman <b>will</b> <b>step</b> back and, if necessary, stand on his tip toes to raise his bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, he also receives the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce.|$|E

25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to have watched the scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that someone <b>will</b> <b>step</b> forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Constant-voltage speaker {{systems are}} {{analogous}} to electrical power transmission methods employed by power companies to transmit electrical power over long distances. Typically, a power company <b>will</b> <b>step</b> up the voltage {{of the power}} being transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current and therefore also reduces the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped back down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to convert the voltage back to a usable level.|$|E

[...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I sat back and watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't find time to do that. I stopped thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1637 {{fully-fledged}} opera came to Venice {{with the}} opening of the Teatro San Cassiano. Sponsored by the wealthy Tron family, this theatre was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. The theatre's inaugural performance, on 6 March 1637, was L'Andromeda by Francesco Manelli and Benedetto Ferrari. This work was received with great enthusiasm, as was the same pair's La Maga fulminata the following year. In rapid succession three more opera houses opened in the city, as the ruling families of the Republic sought to express their wealth and status by investing in the new musical fashion. At first, Monteverdi remained aloof from these activities, perhaps on account of his age (he was over 70), or perhaps through the dignity of his office as maestro di capella at St. Mark's. Nevertheless, an unidentified contemporary, commenting on Monteverdi's silence, opined that the maestro might yet produce an opera for Venice: [...] "God willing, one of these nights he too <b>will</b> <b>step</b> onto the stage." [...] This remark proved prescient; Monteverdi's first public contribution to Venetian opera came in the 1639–40 carnival season, a revival of his L'Arianna at the Teatro San Moisè.|$|E
