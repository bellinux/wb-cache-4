25|$|Rugby League {{is a minor}} {{sport in}} Scotland, with the country never having had a {{professional}} club. Participation in rugby league has increased though, with a Scottish division in the Rugby League Conference with seven teams, including four in the Glasgow/West Scotland area having formed in 2006. But, unlike in England, rugby league {{is not one of}} the ten most played sports in Scotland amongst adults. Junior development has been much more rapid, with several Conference teams having junior squads as well as other clubs who don't run an open-age squad having various junior squads. An estimated 2,500 children play rugby league in Scotland, with that figure growing to 12,500 <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> the amount of children who play the sport in various school programmes. In terms of media coverage, apart from Challenge Cup matches rugby league is not shown on Scottish terrestrial television and no matches are usually broadcast on radio. However, Scotland international matches usually get reported in national newspapers like The Scotsman and sometimes in Scottish editions of London-based newspapers.|$|E

However, other themes served as inspiration. [...] "Money Made" [...] is a {{criticism}} on how, according to Angus, in the US [...] "everything is money these days".

The original arcade Version of Puyo Puyo SUN was an almost exact copy of the Sega Saturn version, as for the fact it appeared in the Sega STV hardware; one major difference being the added voices to the Saturn version. The Game Boy Color version could be used in the N64 Transfer Pak together with Puyo Puyo~n Party 64 to unlock extra artwork within the game.

500|$|Frank, {{who worked}} on the Vioxx case early in his career, was called [...] "perhaps the loudest critic of the Vioxx litigation," [...] and debated trial lawyer Mark Lanier about the issue. Frank {{continued}} his criticism in a 2011 article. [...] "A final sordid chapter in the tort litigation over Vioxx closed, as Judge Eldon Fallon divvied up $315 million to be paid to the plaintiffs' attorneys {{who worked on}} the litigation. This sum was in addition to the more than $1.2 billion already paid to such attorneys. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> in what Merck paid to plaintiffs and for its own attorneys, the Vioxx litigation cost it more than $7 billion. Yet Merck almost certainly did not do anything wrong. Even as an unsympathetic corporate defendant, it won the vast majority of cases that went to trial, and another dozen or more that plaintiffs' attorneys dismissed on the eve of trial rather than risk the publicity of a certain loss. Even in the handful of cases that Merck lost at trial, such as the $253 million verdict in the Ernst case that generated much of the publicity that led {{to tens of thousands of}} cases being filed, Merck won reversals of most of those on appeal because the verdicts were based on conclusory junk-science expert testimony that should not have been admitted into evidence." [...] Lanier defended the settlement as fair.|$|E

2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> what's been going on in your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E

For [...] (more pigeons than pigeonholes) it is one, in which case it coincides with the ordinary pigeonhole principle. But even {{if the number of}} pigeons does not exceed the number of pigeonholes (...) , due to the random nature of the assignment of pigeons to pigeonholes there is often a substantial chance that clashes will occur. For example, if 2 pigeons are randomly assigned to 4 pigeonholes, there is a 25% chance that at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon; for 5 pigeons and 10 holes, that probability is 69.76%; and for 10 pigeons and 20 holes it is about 93.45%. If the number of holes stays fixed, there is always a greater probability of a pair <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> more pigeons.

The first experiments with fiberglas began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ability to}} scale a web {{application}} or website is tied directly to understanding where the resource constraints lie and what impact {{the addition of}} various resources has on the application. Unfortunately, architects {{more often than not}} assume that simply adding another server into the mix can fix any performance problem and security issues. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> start <b>adding</b> new hardware/update existing hardware in a web cloud, the complexity starts increasing which affects performance and hence security. While priced cloud computing services save pains to maintain the computational environment, there are several drawbacks such as overhead of virtual machines, possibility to share one physical machine with several virtual machines, and indeterminacy of topological allocation of their own virtual machines. Multi-tenancy is one of key characteristics of the service oriented computing especially for Software as a Service (SaaS) to leverage economy of scale to drive down total cost of ownership for both service consumer and provider. This paper aims to study the technologies to build a cost-effective, secure and scalable multi-tenant infrastructure and how to improve the security and enhance its performance. This paper also identifies the potential performance bottlenecks, summarizes corresponding optimization approaches and best implementation practices for different multi-tenant business usage models...|$|R

It is rich with every kind of passionate incident; it has all the strange vicissitudes of oriental history. What career could be more wonderful than that of Almanzor, who began life as a professional letter-writer, (a calling which you may still see exercised in the public places of Madrid or Seville,) and ended it as absolute ruler of an Empire! His charm of manner, his skill in flattery, the military genius which he developed when occasion called, his generosity and sense of justice, his love of literature and art, make him a figure to be contemplated with admiration; and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> his utter lack of scruple, his selfishness, his ingratitude, his perfidy, you have a character complex enough to satisfy the most exacting.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the country}} that Dicky came to was a hard land, where [...] "men" [...] of twenty-one were {{reckoned}} very small boys indeed, and life was expensive. The salary that loomed so large six thousand miles away did not go far. Particularly when Dicky divided it by two, and remitted more than the fair half, at 1-6, to Montpelier Square. One hundred and thirty-five rupees out of three hundred and thirty is not much to live on; but it was absurd to suppose that Mrs. Hatt could exist forever on the 20 pounds held back by Dicky, from his outfit allowance. Dicky saw this, and remitted at once; always remembering that Rs. 700 were to be paid, twelve months later, for a first-class passage out for a lady. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> to these trifling details the natural instincts of a boy beginning {{a new life in}} a new country and longing to go about and enjoy himself, and the necessity for grappling with strange work--which, properly speaking, should take up a boy's undivided attention--you will see that Dicky started handicapped.

60|$|And {{now comes}} the further {{exceedingly}} difficult inquiry--how is it that this plant, the torula, produces this singular operation of the splitting up of the sugar? Fabroni, to whom I referred some time ago, imagined that the effervescence of fermentation was produced in just {{the same way as}} the effervescence of a sedlitz powder, that the yeast was a kind of acid, and that the sugar was a combination of carbonic acid and some base to form the alcohol, and that the yeast combined with this substance, and set free the carbonic acid; just as <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> carbonate of soda to acid you turn out the carbonic acid. But of course the discovery of Lavoisier that the carbonic acid and the alcohol taken together are very nearly equal in weight to the sugar, completely upset this hypothesis. Another view was therefore taken by the French chemist, Thenard, and it is still held by a very eminent chemist, M. Pasteur, and their view is this, that the yeast, so to speak, eats a little of the sugar, turns a little of it to its own purposes, and by so doing gives such a shape to the sugar that the rest of it breaks up into carbonic acid and alcohol.|$|E
