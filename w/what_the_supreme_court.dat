It first {{shows that the}} opinion leans in the {{direction}} of marriage equality but ultimately resists any dispositive “equality” or “federalism” interpretation. The Article next examines why the opinion seems intended to preserve for itself a Delphic obscurity. The Article reads Windsor as an exemplar of what judicial opinions may look like in transition periods, when a Bickelian Court seeks to invite, not end, a national conversation, and to nudge it in a certain direction. In such times, federalism rhetoric—like manipulating the tiers of scrutiny and the justiciability doctrines—may be used as a way station toward a particular later resolution...|$|R

Dutton further claimed that since the Warren Bridge had now taken all of the traffic of the Charles River Bridge, the construction of the Warren Bridge had been an act of confiscation, and that the property of the plaintiffs had been taken from them and given to the public. If the Court sided with Warren Bridge, Dutton argued, then [...] "all sense of security for the rights of persons and property would be lost." ...|$|R

The Article concludes - albeit with some important qualifications - that a right not to keep or bear arms is implied by <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> has called the “core” and “central component” of the Second Amendment: self-defense, especially in the home.

The second is how best to tell what I will call the legal story: how to understand the constitutional landscape that confronted New Deal reformers, how they negotiated it, and how and in <b>what</b> respects <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> transformed that body of constitutional law during the Great Depression.
