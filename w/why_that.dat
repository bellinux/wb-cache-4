By 1938, SR85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo and <b>Why</b> <b>that</b> would eventually become part of SR85. The portion between Why and the border with Mexico began showing up on maps at this time as a gravel road. In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo and Why was added to the state highway system, but as SR86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the United States-Mexico border with an overlap with SR86 between Ajo and Why when a county road was added to SR85.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires an understanding of how and <b>why</b> <b>that</b> information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} ice age, Sweden was covered with an ice sheet, which withdrew from the region about 10000 years ago. The glacier {{left behind in the}} region many eskers and moraines, such as the esker Enköpingsåsen. When the glacier withdrew, the soil had been so {{compressed}} by its mass that the entire zone situated to the east of Avesta found itself at sea level. During this maritime period, sediments deposited themselves on the bedrock, which explains <b>why</b> <b>that</b> region even today has superior fertility to that {{of the rest of the}} country. It is the reason why the line of separation between the north and the south (the Limes Norrlandicus), which passes not far from the park, is so visible in the region: the zone to the north of the limes was not covered with these sediments.|$|E
25|$|Most {{countries}} {{provide a}} variety of services to assist homeless people. They often provide food, shelter and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often {{with the help of}} volunteers) or by government departments. These programs may be supported by a government, charities, churches and individual donors. In 1998, a study by Koegel and Schoeni of a homeless population in Los Angeles, California, reported that a significant number of homeless do not participate in government assistance programs, and the authors reported being puzzled as to <b>why</b> <b>that</b> was, with the only possible suggestion from the evidence being that transaction costs were perhaps too high. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Administration have a special Section 8 housing voucher program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans. The HUD-VASH program has shown success in housing many homeless veterans.|$|E

Burton explained, [...] "I don't understand <b>why</b> <b>that</b> became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work." [...] Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot. Bob Kane supported this decision.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The Daily Telegraph, British doctor and science writer James Le Fanu was critical, and commented that Taylor did not {{acknowledge}} [...] "the explanatory gap" [...] between current understanding of the brain's structure and [...] "what it does, how we think, feel and emote". Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing is {{that it would have been}} a much more interesting book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain <b>why</b> <b>that</b> 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, now seems to be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who might know it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are all a little bit brainwashed by our culture and experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the same classification as the tabloid press. [...] A review in Financial Times by Jerome Burne was also critical, and he commented that Taylor does not convey [...] "a clear enough message" [...] in the work.|$|E

Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes you appreciate <b>why</b> <b>that</b> earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously backs away from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E
