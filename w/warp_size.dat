If some threads in the warp choose different branches of operation based on the processed data, the threads within the warp may diverge.

Sizing {{is an essential}} process to impart protection to warp yarns and increase weaving efficiency. Cotton yarns have traditionally been sized with starch, modified starch derivatives, CMC, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), or a combination thereof along with quite a few other fiber binding ingredients. Although starch and starch derivatives are extensively used for sizing, there can be several limitations including less-than-satisfactory sizing performance and difficulties in desizing starch based size.

Thousands of threads can be created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known as warps. High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing such warps with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads, this warp will be broken into multiple warps {{that have to be}} executed serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In this thesis, the contemporary fixed-size warp design is abandoned and a hybrid <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> (HWS) mechanism is proposed. Mixed-size warps are generated according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. Once a branch divergence occurs, split warps are squeezed according to the proposed algorithm, and warp sizes are downscaled wherever applicable. Based on updated warp sizes, warp schedulers calculate the number of cycles the current warp needs and issue the next warp accordingly. As a result, hybrid warps are pushed into pipelines as soon as possible and more pipeline stages are overlapped. The simulation results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1. 20 over the baseline architecture {{for a wide variety of}} general purpose GPU applications. This work also integrates HWS with dynamic warp formation (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism aimed at improving SIMD utilization by forming new warps out of split warps in real time. The warp forming policy is modified to better tolerate warp conflicts. Also, squeeze operations are added before a warp merges with other warps.

Each yarn element during unwinding performs a complex motion that involves a movement along the yarn axis and rotation about the package axis. Parameters that affect the yarn tension are linear yarn density, unwinding speed, package diameter, balloon profile, and specific yarn winding density of the cone or cheese. This paper analyses mathematically the influence of the above stated parameters at the guide eyelet on yarn unwinding tension. On the basis of the model it proposes a cost effective mechanical device for tension variation control where a movable guide eyelet is used. The proposed device helps to minimize tension variation during unwinding and to obtain more or less constant tension, which definitely improves the quality of the package prepared from cones or cheeses (for example a warp beam). The concept behind the proposed system is to move the guide eyelet with respect to reducing cone or cheese diameter according to the proposed mathematical model.

However, PVA does not degrade and is a major contributor to pollution in textile effluent treatment plants.

In this research, the potential of using soy proteins as textile sizing agents to replace PVA was studied.

Soy protein size had a 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand / chemical oxygen demand ratio of 0. 57 compared to 0. 01 for PVA indicating that soy protein sizes were easily biodegradable in activated sludge.

It introduced the idea of Single Instruction Multiple Thread (SIMT) execution, as well as dramatically improving the CUDA programming language used to program on GPGPUs. Since then, GPGPUs have grown as an alternative to traditional CPU based computing for a variety of parallel applications such as neural networking, Big-Data analytics, and machine learning. However, the SIMT execution model breaks down for programs with control divergence (namely branches) because the system can only support a single instruction stream. Thus, threads that do not take the current executing branch must wait their turn often leading to dramatic performance loss. In order to combat this, this paper proposes a Multiple Fragment Multiple Thread (MFMT) architecture allowing multiple instruction streams to execute in parallel on GPGPUs. ^ MFMT 2 ̆ 7 s key insight is that a small number of control flow paths can be supported by current GPGPUs without major modifications, instead harnessing resources that are under-utilized in control-divergent applications.
