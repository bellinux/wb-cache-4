500|$|Much of Mason's {{efforts in}} 1774 and 1775 was in {{organizing}} a militia {{independent of the}} royal government. Washington by January 1775 was drilling a small force, and he and Mason purchased gunpowder for the company. Mason wrote in favor of annual election of militia officers in words that would later echo in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, [...] "We came equal into this world, and equals shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of it. All men are by nature born equally free and independent." ...|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go back again and now do it nationwide-style".|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{called his}} team {{together}} {{the night before}} the Test began. His first words were [...] "Chaps, you have got to get stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there to-morrow and get stuck right into it." [...] He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.|$|E
5000|$|When you <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{with friends}} to drink or {{shopping}} {{and you take}} the bill, the term House is used. For example, <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with Kenneth last night and he housed us meaning <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with Kenneth last night and he paid for the drinks ...|$|R

2500|$|... (Camp Hope) was a tent {{city that}} sprang {{up in the}} desert as word of the mine's {{collapse}} spread. At first, relatives gathered at the mine entrance and slept in cars as they waited and prayed for word on the rescue operation's progress. As days turned into weeks, friends brought them tents and other camping supplies to provide shelter from the harsh desert climate. The encampment grew {{with the arrival of}} more friends and relatives, additional rescue and construction workers, and members of the media. Government ministers held regular briefings for the families and journalists at the camp. [...] "We're not going to abandon this camp until <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with the last miner left", said María Segovia, [...] "There are 33 of them, and one is my brother".|$|E
2500|$|It's {{not really}} revenge, I think, if anything, it's redemption. But it's more about us, it's {{not so much}} about Tennessee. We didn't play very well last year when we went there and {{probably}} got caught a little too much focusing on them and the environment and that type of thing. So at practice this year, we're really just focusing on ourselves if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and play to our potential then we'll have a chance to be successful. Last year we didn't come close to our potential so we had no chance. Of course it's a big game like it was last year, two ranked teams, so there's a lot of people watching it to see what's going on. It wasn't that we lost the game last year, I think it was the way we lost the game last year that was the devastating part of it, that hung with us so long.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{toured the}} United Kingdom in 1979 as support to Graham Parker & the Rumour, signing {{a deal with}} UK label Stiff Records. In the US they were {{released}} via Arista Records, and the Ariola Label in continental Europe. Their second album, Don’t Throw Stones, consolidated their Australian chart success, peaking at No.9, and yielding two singles, [...] "Don't Throw Stones" [...] (No.26) and [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] (No.74). Their third album, Suddenly, featured a slicker, more pop sound, and charted at No.74. It provided two more singles, [...] "Strangers on a Train" [...] (No.22) and [...] "Perhaps". During his time with The Sports, Pendlebury worked on side projects, including The Gentlemen with Bates, Wayne Duncan (Daddy Cool) on bass guitar, and Freddie Strauks (Skyhooks) on drums. The Sports fourth album, Sondra (No.20), was released in 1981. It yielded three singles [...] "Stop the Baby Talking", [...] "How Come?" [...] (No.21) and [...] "When <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Out</b> Tonight". By {{the end of the}} year The Sports had disbanded.|$|E

2500|$|Former Ambassador to Egypt [...] Frank Wisner said:"It wasn’t the {{military}} that plotted the seizure {{of the government and}} grabbed it. It was a massive public uprising that, left unchecked, would have produced great violence. It would have left {{the military}} in the miserable position of having to control those demonstrations by force. The cry from the crowd was they wanted new elections … to help decide the country's future, which has been so troubled. The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. We have to ask ourselves, then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. So we want to be very, very careful before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population. What is clear is the wave of anger against the government that drove Morsi from power, enjoyed massive, massive public support in the many, many millions of Egyptians.|$|E
60|$|And, {{wonder of}} wonders, punctually to the second, off <b>we</b> <b>go,</b> <b>out</b> of Cagliari. En route again.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sahib. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> by an {{entrance}} on to a bastion, flanking the gate. The rope {{will be long}} enough there or, at any rate, there will be but a very short drop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, {{in answer}} to her remark, [...] "but it's curious that I can't fix my mind upon the subject here. The night's mild; shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on to the veranda?" ...|$|E
