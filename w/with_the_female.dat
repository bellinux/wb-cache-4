5|$|Sun Media's Jason MacNeil {{rated the}} Toronto show three-and-a-half stars out of five, praising Usher's {{connection}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> audience. Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle commended Usher's live vocal ability.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the male}} mounts and copulates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Afterward, the male {{generally}} dismounts {{and the two}} pair usually run away from each other. However, the male sometimes chases the female and tries to copulate again.|$|E
5|$|Male blackcaps will {{sometimes}} sing even when incubating, {{especially with the}} second brood. This appears to be intended to maintain the bond <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Wintering birds in Africa are quiet initially, but start singing in January or February prior to their return north.|$|E
500|$|Resident males mate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> {{in their}} harems, {{and it is}} less common for outside males to copulate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> Female {{offspring}} often remain in their natal groups [...] Several matrilines {{can be found in}} a group, as unrelated females regularly join groups. Male offspring tend to live in their natal groups until they are about two years old, sometimes being forcefully expelled by the resident adult males.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 30-45 mm, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> being {{larger than}} the males.|$|R
50|$|Pairs sing a duetting song <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> call being higher-pitched {{than that}} of the male.|$|R
5|$|The hen alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch. The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> until she has {{completed}} moulting.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the song replaces the word 'nights' with 'lights', in the line 'There were nights of endless pleasure'. The ending of the single version is different, {{concluding}} with an additional 'We forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me now'. The album version, following those recorded by Pandora's Box and Celine Dion, ends <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> voice whispering 'And if we...', followed by four piano notes.|$|E
5|$|When a male detects a female, it chases {{the female}} and begins courtship. Females are larger and slower than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female. The males then align their bodies <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> and rhythmically contract; the {{resulting}} mass of snakes can remain nearly motionless for several days. After courtship, the snakes copulate {{for about an}} average of two hours.|$|E
5|$|Satellite males, about 16% of {{the total}} number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> visiting <b>the</b> territories {{occupied}} by the resident males. Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> <b>the</b> presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.|$|R
50|$|The genus shows marked sexual {{dimorphism}} (differences between <b>the</b> sexes), <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> being {{smaller and}} less colorful.|$|R
25|$|After mating, mass migrations occur <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> {{returning}} to <b>the</b> sea to release their fertilised eggs. An average female carries around 85,000 eggs.|$|R
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{played the}} lead role in two Python films, Holy Grail and Life of Brian. He was chosen to play the lead in Holy Grail because of the group's respect towards his {{straight}} acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters. Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude {{in front of a}} crowd in Life of Brian, but the scene, filmed in Tunisia, caused problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> Muslim extras.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{primarily}} feed on granadilla species. Adults feed on nectar from Lantana flowers, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> also collecting pollen from Psiguria and Psychotia flowers.|$|R
50|$|Betta persephone {{is a small}} {{species with}} a maximum length of 2.6 cm SL. The males are largely blue-black in colour, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> exhibiting browner tones.|$|R
50|$|Mercury: A male; {{the only}} one who stays <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and their young outside of winter. He acts as a {{messenger}} amongst the Silverwings, befitting his namesake.|$|R
5|$|In the Dreamcast {{version of}} the game, a meter on the system's Visual Memory Unit shows how the player is doing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> characters: it shows three blocks, which have hearts inside if the player is doing well. In the PlayStation Portable version, the player has access to a glossary, which {{explains}} various key words used in the game. In the Android version, the player gets points throughout the game, {{which can be used}} to unlock applications such as a calculator, a calendar, and mini-games.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E

50|$|In the 2001 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census, the {{population}} was 3,029 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> outnumbering <b>the</b> males 53.6% against 46.4%, 1.0% of {{the population}} of Oaklands Park Indigenous Australians.|$|R
5000|$|Copulation {{takes place}} {{right after the}} rainy season, during the months from September through November. [...] Males combat each other for {{breeding}} rights <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and are vocal during copulation.|$|R
5|$|Like other {{characters}} in the trilogy, Tali has been subject to various merchandise. DC Direct included Tali their first line of Mass Effect 2 squadmate figures, first revealed in January 2010 and then released in April 2011. A second figure was announced during Comic-Con 2012, as part of Square Enix's second line of Play Arts Kai Mass Effect figures (along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> Shepard). BioWare also officially endorsed an originally fan-made plushie of the character, selling it on their online store. Dark Horse's Mass Effect playing cards feature Tali as the Queen of Hearts, alongside other Mass Effect 2 characters in other roles.|$|E
5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nose {{piercing}} {{also has}} a long history. c. 1500 BCE, the Vedas refer to Lakshmi's nose piercings, but modern practice in India {{is believed to have}} spread from the Middle Eastern nomadic tribes by route of the Mughal emperors in the 16th century. It remains customary for Indian Hindu women of childbearing age to wear a nose stud, usually in the left nostril, due to the nostril's association <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> reproductive organs in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E

50|$|Marsupial frogs are {{so-called}} {{because they}} possess a dorsal brood pouch. In some species {{the eggs are}} fertilized on <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> lower back, and are inserted in her pouch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aid of the male's toes. The eggs remain in contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> vascular tissue, which provides them oxygen.|$|R
50|$|Ichneumon wasp {{species are}} highly diverse, ranging from 3 to 130 mm long. Most are slender, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> of many species (particularly in the genus Megarhyssa) having {{extremely}} long ovipositors for laying eggs.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that {{is seen as a}} white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E
5|$|The close {{relationship}} between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, The male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo can not mate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> redback as the male katipo is heavier than the male redback and when it approaches the web it triggers a predatory response in the female leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
50|$|The {{mourning}} wheatear was first described by Martin Lichtenstein in 1823. It {{is found in}} semi-desert areas in North Africa and the Middle East. It is sexually dimorphic <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> sporting more subtle plumage.|$|R

50|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{in their first}} year and males in their second year. It is assumed the males wake from torpor and mate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> during winter. A single pup is born in spring (October-November).|$|R
