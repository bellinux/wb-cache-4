40|$|During {{metallic}} {{wire drawing}} processes, {{the presence of}} knots {{and the failure to}} detect them can lead to long production interruptions, significant economic losses and a lower quality of final product. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop methods for real-time detection and prevention of this fault. In this paper, a sensor to prevent the formation of knots during the metallic wire drawing process is presented and evaluated by means of experimental data. This fast, inexpensive, non-contact sensor is based on electromagnetic principles such as eddy current induction, magnetic reluctance variations and magnetic coupling. The proposed sensor without direct contact can detect knots in a target metallic wire by measuring the impedance variations of a calibrated sensing coil caused by either a knot or an unwound loop rising from a wire rod. The incorporation of this type of sensor into a <b>wire-drawing</b> <b>machine</b> can avoid the tightening of the knot, thereby reducing downtime and increasing the security and reliability of the process. Experiments were conducted using a scale model of the above proposed system. This allowed highlighting the sensorâ€™s potential by carrying out an automatic, real-time knot detection during steel wire drawingPreprin...|$|E
50|$|Ferrari is a {{manufacturer}} of two and four wheel tractors devoted to agriculture and lawn care. It was created in 1954, during the agricultural reconstruction period of the country. After an initial period dedicated {{to the production of}} <b>wire-drawing</b> <b>machines</b> for irrigation pipes, in 1957 Ferrari took part in the Verona exhibition with its first agricultural machine: the two-wheel tractor MC 57, which carries the date of its birth. In 1965 Ferrari launched the first articulated tractor MT65. The range of products was increased to motor mowers and tractors for diverse applications. At the end of the 1960s, the company looked to foreign markets; the subsidiary company Ferrari France was established in 1972. In 1988 Ferrari became part of the BCS Group. Today Ferrari has a wide range of machines between maintenance machines for recreational use and professional tractors for niche agriculture. Headquarters and factories are located at Abbiategrasso.|$|R
