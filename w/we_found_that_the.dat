25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E

So we thought that we {{must be one of}} the lost tribes." [...] After making contact with Israelis, they began to study normative Judaism and established several synagogues. Hundreds of Mizo-Kuki-Chin emigrated to Israel. They were required to formally convert to be accepted as Jews, because their history was not documented. Also, given their long migration and intermarriage, they had lost the maternal ancestry of Jews.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} market {{performance}} at selected, representative natural gas trading hubs in the U. S. and documented different price behaviors among various hubs. With NYMEX prices as the competitive benchmark, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> empirically <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spot price responses at some trading hubs were systematically asymmetric, thus demonstrating a market advantage by either buyers or sellers. <b>We</b> further <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of market power {{was a very}} plausible explanation for this price behavior at some hubs. ...|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dead literati of Ferrara had {{the place}} wholly to themselves; not a living soul disputed the {{solitude}} of the halls with the custodians, and the bust of Ariosto looked down from his monument upon rows of empty tables, idle chairs, and dusty inkstands.|$|E

Furthermore, <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> truncated-cone reflector can significantly increase the gain of the helical antenna compared to a circular or a square flat reflector. A set of diagrams is made to enable simple design of helical antennas with truncated-cone reflectors. Finally, the results are experimentally verified. 1...|$|R
