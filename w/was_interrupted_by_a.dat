5|$|The Type 42 destroyers (also {{known as}} the Sheffield class) were made in three batches; Cardiff {{was built in the}} first. She cost over £30million, which was double her {{original}} quoted price. Her keel was laid down on 6 November 1972, at Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The build <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> labour shortage at Vickers. To solve this problem, she was towed to Swan Hunter Hawthorn Leslie yard in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear and completed there.|$|E

5|$|The {{war with}} Persia <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> three-year truce agreed in 575. In 578, {{hostilities}} were renewed, but the sources on the period, fragmentary as they are, do not mention any Ghassanid participation {{for the first}} two years. In 580, Mundhir was invited by Emperor Tiberius II (r. 578–582) to visit the capital again. He arrived in the city on 8 February, accompanied by two of his sons, and was lavishly received. On this occasion, among a multitude of other gifts, he was also presented with a royal crown, instead of the simpler coronet or diadem he had been awarded before.|$|E
5|$|After this success, which {{secured the}} Balkans, Maurice {{intended}} to consolidate Roman control {{by bringing in}} Armenian settlers who would be given land in exchange for military service. To this end, Priscus was sent to Armenia to recruit men and their families. His mission there, however, <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large-scale military revolt that brought about the downfall of Maurice. In 602, Maurice again ordered his troops on the Danube frontier to winter north of the river. Again, this provoked widespread discontent, and when Peter, who had replaced Priscus, refused to bow down and rescind the order, an outright mutiny broke out. The army chose the officer Phocas as its new leader and marched down to Constantinople. Without any credible military forces of his own, Maurice had to flee, but was captured {{with his family and}} executed by Phocas, who now became emperor.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in east Moscow, Streltsov joined Torpedo {{at the age of}} 16 in 1953 and made his {{international}} debut two years later. He was part of the squad that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, and came seventh in the 1957 Ballon d'Or. Early the next year his promising career <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rape scandal. The 20-year-old Streltsov was accused of raping a woman shortly before the 1958 World Cup; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt, he confessed, despite inconclusive evidence against him. He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in the Gulag system of forced labour camps.|$|E

Cooper received the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in Sergeant York and High Noon. He also received an Academy Honorary Award for his career achievements in 1961. He {{was one of the}} top ten film personalities for twenty-three consecutive years, {{and was one of the}} top money-making stars for eighteen years. The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the twenty five greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema.|$|E
5|$|The debacle at Kasserine Pass {{strained}} {{relations between}} the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation was operating at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. This elicited a scathing response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence of American troops. Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could not control the acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> German air raid that convinced the airmen that General Patton had a point. Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and he apologized.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Murphy and {{directed}} by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, who had most recently directed Asian F.

Both {{of the last two}} shooting days before the vacation began, December 15 and 16, ran a couple of hours past midnight, with the final night not ending until three in the morning. Filming had not yet completed when the twelfth episode, with guest star Ricky Martin, began filming on January 5, 2012, the third day after the holiday vacation ended. The two episodes continued in parallel until the final Michael Jackson number was shot on January 13, 2012, over a month after filming began and the same day that the thirteenth episode commenced filming.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke's (Paul Keane) bucks party. When the night <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> neighbour, Daphne left some {{belongings}} behind {{and returned the}} following morning to collect them. Des's fiancée assumed she {{had spent the night}} and called the wedding off. Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off, Daphne moved in. Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship.|$|E
5|$|The keel for New Jersey {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Fore River Shipyard on 3 May 1902. She was {{launched}} on 10 November 1904; the daughter of Franklin Murphy, then the Governor of New Jersey, christened the ship. She was commissioned into the US fleet on 12 May 1906, Captain William Kimball in command. New Jersey began her initial training in the Atlantic and Caribbean, which <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Oyster Bay in September. On 21 September, the ship was deployed to Cuba {{to take part in}} the Second Occupation of Cuba; she remained there until 13 October. New Jersey participated in the Jamestown Exposition from 15 April to 14 May 1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull {{started playing}} cricket {{from a young}} age without distinction. He made his {{professional}} debut in Melbourne's district competition staying {{until the age of}} 19. His progress <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> posting as a schoolteacher to a country town. After returning to Melbourne in 1921, he {{came to the attention of}} the state selectors, and made his first-class debut for Victoria at the age of 24 late in 1921–22. After scoring a century in his second match, Woodfull was promoted to open the following season, and he opened for the rest of his career. In his first four seasons at first-class level, he accumulated over 3,000 first-class runs at an average beyond 65. At the end of the 1924–25 season, Woodfull scored 522 runs in four innings, including three centuries. After scoring three centuries, including a 236, in 1925–26, he was selected for the 1926 tour of England.|$|E
5|$|Despite Justinian's {{intentions}} and proclamations, however, Roman control over Africa {{was not yet}} secure. During his campaign, Belisarius had secured most of the provinces of Byzacena, Zeugitana and Tripolitania. Further west, on the other hand, imperial control extended {{in a series of}} strongholds captured by the fleet along the coast as far as Constantine, while most of the inland areas of Numidia and Mauretania remained {{under the control of the}} local Moorish tribes, as indeed had been the case under the Vandal kings. The Moors initially acknowledged the Emperor's suzerainty and gave hostages to the imperial authorities, but they soon became restive and rose in revolt. The first imperial governor, Belisarius' former domesticus Solomon, who combined the offices of both magister militum and praetorian prefect, was able to score successes against them and strengthen Roman rule in Africa, but his work <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> widespread military mutiny in 536. The mutiny was eventually subdued by Germanus, a cousin of Justinian, and Solomon returned in 539. He fell, however, in the Battle of Cillium in 544 against the united Moorish tribes, and Roman Africa was again in jeopardy. It would not be until 548 that the resistance of the Moorish tribes would be finally broken by the talented general John Troglita.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

5|$|On September 16, {{while on}} patrol west of Philadelphia, Pulaski spotted {{significant}} British forces {{moving toward the}} Continental position. Upon being informed by Pulaski, Washington prepared for a battle, but the encounter <b>was</b> <b>interrupted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> major storm before either side was organized. On October 4, Pulaski {{took part in the}} Battle of Germantown. He spent the winter of 1777 to 1778 with most of the army at Valley Forge. Pulaski argued that the military operations should continue through the winter, but this idea was rejected by the general staff. In turn, he focused on reorganizing the cavalry force, mostly stationed in Trenton. While at Trenton his assistance was requested by General Anthony Wayne, whom Washington had dispatched on a foraging expedition into southern New Jersey. Wayne was in danger of encountering a much larger British force sent to oppose his movements. Pulaski and 50 cavalry rode south to Burlington, where they skirmished with British sentries on February 28. After this minor encounter the British commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Stirling, was apparently convinced that he was facing a much larger force than expected, and prepared to withdraw his troops across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania at Cooper's Ferry (present-day Gloucester City). Pulaski and Wayne joined forces to attack Stirling's position on February 29 while he awaited suitable weather conditions to cross. In the resulting skirmish (which only involved a few hundred men out of the larger forces on either side), Pulaski's horse was shot out from under him and a few of his cavalry were wounded.|$|E
