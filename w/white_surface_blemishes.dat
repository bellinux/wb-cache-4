40|$|An image {{analysis}} method for real-time <b>surface</b> <b>blemish</b> detection using passive imagery and fuzzy set concepts is described. The method develops an internal knowledge representation for <b>surface</b> <b>blemish</b> characteristics {{on the basis}} of experience, thus facilitating autonomous learning based upon positive and negative exemplars. The method incorporates fuzzy set concepts in the learning subsystem and image segmentation algorithms, thereby mimicking human visual perception. This enables a generic solution for color image segmentation. This method has been applied in the development of ARIES (Autonomous Robotic Inspection Experimental System), designed to inspect DOE warehouse waste storage drums for rust. In this project, the ARIES vision system is used to acquire drum surface images under controlled conditions and subsequently perform visual inspection leading to the classification of the drum as acceptable or suspect...|$|R

50|$|The light-green <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> turn orange {{when the}} fruit {{is at its}} peak ripeness. An ugli fruit is usually {{slightly}} larger than a grapefruit (but this varies) and has fewer seeds. The flesh is very juicy and tends towards the sweet side of the tangerine rather than the bitter side of its grapefruit lineage, with a fragrant rind.|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{vibrators}} consolidate freshly {{poured concrete}} so that trapped air and excess water are released and the concrete settles {{firmly in place}} in the formwork. Improper consolidation of concrete can cause product defects, compromise the concrete strength, and produce <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> such as bug holes and honeycombing. An internal concrete vibrator is a steel cylinder {{about the size of the}} handle of a baseball bat, with a hose or electrical cord attached to one end. The vibrator head is immersed in the wet concrete.|$|R
25|$|During the 1970s, two {{changes were}} made to the system. Firstly, the Internally Flawless grade was added, as GIA noticed that many {{diamonds}} were being aggressively cut to remove any <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes,</b> and thereby reducing the cutting quality ("make") of the diamonds. The Internally Flawless grade gave diamond manufacturers a choice to leave <b>blemishes</b> on the <b>surface</b> of the stone, and achieve a grade higher than VVS1. The second change made to the grading system was the introduction of the I3 grade. This change was made in response to a growing number of diamonds of very low clarity being cut.|$|R
50|$|Although {{logistics}} can get tricky, {{the concept}} of the Potato Project is practical and straightforward: tractor-trailer loads of potatoes and other produce are often rejected by commercial markets or potato chip factories due to imperfections in shape, size, <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes,</b> or sugar content. Usually, these perfectly edible rejected loads end up at landfills. Through the Potato Project, however, the Society of St. Andrew is able to redirect these 45,000-pound loads of fresh, nutritious produce to soup kitchens, Native American reservations, food pantries, low income housing areas, local churches, and other hunger agencies for distribution to the poor.|$|R

40|$|As {{hypothesized}} by Gaspard Monge in {{the eighteenth}} century, <b>white</b> <b>surfaces</b> have a unique property that distinguishes them from other coloured specular surfaces. We test his hypothesis using modern digital imagery and find it to hold. We then incorporate it into an algorithm that identifies <b>white</b> <b>surfaces</b> when the illumination colour is unknown. Since <b>white</b> <b>surfaces</b> reflect the colour of the incident illumination, the method also has application {{to the problem of}} illumination estimation for colour constancy...|$|R

Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] scurf is caused by a fungus, Helminthosporium solani, a relatively new problem related to potato production in North America. It wasn’t until the early 1990 s that this fungus was identified as being a serious problem in the Pacific Northwest. This fungus produces a <b>surface</b> <b>blemish</b> on tubers, causing them to look dirty. Although some tubers initially become infected in the field, the greatest damage occurs in storage, particularly with increasing time in storage. Economic losses also occur due to increased requirements for inspection and sorting in lots with damage...|$|R
5000|$|In time, George’s two sons, {{brothers}} George T. ("Taylor") and Frederick Oliver (grandsons {{of original}} founder James), joined and eventually {{took over the}} family business, which, for the first time, would operate under the name [...] "Oliver Brothers". Taylor perfected several procedures for removing <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> and transferring paintings on canvasses with defective supports. In the 1920s, he designed and constructed a prototype vacuum hot table to use in his process for relining paintings, for which he received a patent in 1937 - U.S. Patent# 2,073,802. The vacuum hot table has since been adopted throughout the art restoration and conservation industry for use in restoring paintings on textile supports. Taylor's original prototype table remained in use at Oliver Brothers until the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|If {{black and}} <b>white</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{of the same}} shininess are {{visually}} compared, the black surface will always appear glossier because of the greater contrast between the specular highlight and the black surroundings as compared to that with <b>white</b> <b>surface</b> and surroundings. Pfund {{was also the first}} to suggest that more than one method was needed to analyze gloss correctly.|$|R

50|$|Prior to cooking, {{the potato}} should be {{scrubbed}} clean, washed and dried with eyes and <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> removed, and basted with oil (usually Olive oil) or butter and/or salt. Pricking the potato {{with a fork}} or knife allows steam to escape during the cooking process. Potatoes cooked in a microwave oven without pricking the skin might split open due to built up internal pressure from unvented steam. It takes between one and two hours to bake a large potato in a conventional oven at 200 C. Microwaving takes from six to twelve minutes depending on oven power and potato size, but does not generally produce a crisp skin. Some recipes call for use of both a microwave and a conventional oven, with the microwave being used to vent most of the steam prior to the cooking process.|$|R
50|$|Perceived {{color in}} a {{projected}} {{image is a}} factor of both projection surface and projector quality.

50|$|When {{natural light}} strikes blue amber on a <b>white</b> <b>surface,</b> the light passes right through, and is refracted by the <b>white</b> <b>surface.</b> The {{result is the}} slight blue hue of blue amber. When the same natural light strikes the amber on a black surface, the light is not refracted by the black surface, but by the actual amber. Hydrocarbons in the blue amber shift the sun's {{ultraviolet}} light down in frequency, resulting {{in the glow of}} blue amber.|$|R
