40|$|This paper empirically tests whether {{capacity}} {{is used to}} deter entry and whether the amount invested in entry-deterring {{capacity is}} related to market concentration and market presence. We use a unique dataset containing 3, 830 lodging properties in Texas from 1991 through 1997. We find that there is higher investment in capacity relative to demand (i. e., idle capacity) in markets <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> Herfindahl index and by firms <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> share of market capacity. These {{results are consistent with}} the entry deterrence literature that suggests firms in more concentrated markets and firms <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> market share have greater incentive to invest in entry-deterring capacity. 1...|$|R
