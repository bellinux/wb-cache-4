25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might {{have thought it was}} just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame." ...|$|E
500|$|The first chapter, [...] "Gauguin's Questions", {{poses the}} {{questions}} that {{provide a framework for}} the book. Referring to Paul Gauguin's painting of the same name the questions are: Where do we come from? What are we? <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going? Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms [...] "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age, Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

500|$|Development took {{approximately}} two years, and included {{a staff of}} thirty developers. Preliminary planning and creation of the backstory extended to several years before that. The word [...] "Xeno" [...] had been decided between staff from an early stage, with its meaning being [...] "something strange or alien". [...] "Gears" [...] was chosen from multiple suggested words. The game's Gears were not present during early stages, with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters. The game's use of anime cutscenes was chosen as {{it was difficult to}} properly recreated Tanaka's Gear artwork into 3D CGI. The game's engine was also designed to be best suited for the 3D map displays and battle arenas. Takahashi had wanted to create the game in full 3D, but the PlayStation's capacities meant this could not be managed, resulting in the current mesh of 2D sprites against 3D backgrounds. The themes and story were greatly influenced by the works and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. According to Tanaka, the reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband. According to her, the story revolved around [...] "where do we come from, what are we, <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going". There was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into the final game. The game's second disc consisted mainly of narration by Fei and Elly of events following the party's escape from Solaris. While it was popularly assumed to be due to budget constraints, Takahashi later revealed the full reason; as his team was inexperienced they were unable to create the entire proposed game in the expected two-year development time, so instead of ending prematurely {{with the end of the}} first disc, Takahashi offered up a compromise which became the second disc's content, allowing the staff to finish the game within time and budget deadlines.|$|E

2500|$|The {{book also}} {{includes}} Murakami's personal {{essay on the}} attacks, [...] "Blind Nightmare: <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> Japanese Going?"

2500|$|Described {{as a work}} of [...] "journalistic literature," [...] Underground was {{originally}} published as a series of separate interviews Murakami conducted with 60 victims of the attacks and descriptions of how the attacks were carried out, along with his essay, [...] "Blind Nightmare: <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> Japanese Going?" [...] In 2000, an English translation was published which included interviews with 8 members of Aum.|$|E
2500|$|Murakami concludes Underground {{with the}} essay, [...] "Blind Nightmare: <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> Japanese Going?" [...] The essay is {{primarily}} a criticism of the Japanese response to the gas attacks, {{not only in terms}} of the actions which were taken, but also in terms of the mentality adopted by most Japanese after the attack. He notes that there is a polemic which was put forth by the media and too readily accepted by the Japanese people, positing the attacks as a matter of [...] "good" [...] versus [...] "evil," [...] "sanity" [...] versus [...] "madness," [...] "Us" [...] versus [...] "Them." [...] By viewing the sarin attacks as [...] "an extreme and exceptional crime committed by an isolated lunatic fringe," [...] it was easy for Japanese citizens to avoid facing the darker realities (which Murakami also refers to as the [...] "underground," [...] adding a deeper layer of meaning to the book's title) of both Japanese society and their own selves.|$|E
