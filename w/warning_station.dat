5|$|Work {{to improve}} the radar continued. An {{improved}} array was designed which covered 60 degrees rather than 30. The first Dnepr radar was built at Balkhash as a new radar, cell 5. It entered service on 12 May 1974. The second was a new early <b>warning</b> <b>station</b> at Sevastopol. New Dneprs were also built at Mishelevka and another at Skrunda, and then one at Mukachevo. The remaining radars were all converted to Dnepr {{with the exception of}} cells 3 and 4 at Balkhash and Mishelevka which remained space surveillance radars.|$|E

After the American conquest of the Marianas, daily bomber raids from the Marianas hit the mainland as part of Operation Scavenger. Iwo Jima served as an early <b>warning</b> <b>station</b> that radioed reports of incoming bombers back to mainland Japan.

In addition to the Pinetree stations located in Canada, three {{stations were}} built in Greenland. The Pinetree stations consisted of three direction centers and seven early <b>warning</b> <b>stations.</b> In Greenland, there were two early <b>warning</b> <b>stations</b> and a direction center.

25|$|The route {{now heads}} back inland towards the next village of Gimingham {{this part of}} the trail passes through the valley of the River Mun. The {{countryside}} along this section is pleasant and very peaceful. One usual sight {{to the north of the}} ‘Trail’ is the giant white sphere which can be glimpsed occasionally. This is the Trimingham Early <b>warning</b> <b>station</b> which is in fact part of RAF Neatishead. The path enters the village of Gimingham past the rebuilt old corn watermill and the preserved steam engine. Like Mundesley, Gimingham parish church is called All Saints. It is south down the main street from the engine. From this point there is an optional tour which takes in the villages of Trunch, Swafield, Bradfield and then back on itself to Trimingham and its unusually named church St John the Baptist’s Head.|$|E
2500|$|In 1923 the North Eastern Railway {{was absorbed}} into the London and North Eastern Railway {{as a result of}} the Railways Act 1921. In 1948 {{nationalisation}} meant that British Railways took control. During this time, little changed on the line. However, in his controversial report Dr Beeching declared that the Whitby-Pickering line was uneconomic and listed it for closure; the last passenger service ran on 6 March 1965 with freight continuing until July 1966. [...] The line was used in June 1965 to house the Royal Train for the Duke of Edinburgh's visit to the RAF Fylingdales early <b>warning</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Cape Cod system reached Initial {{operating}} capability (IOC) as the Cape Cod Missile Early <b>Warning</b> <b>Station</b> on 4 April 1981 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT) completed 21 May; Beale AFB reached IOC on 15 August. The two PAVE PAWS, three BMEWS, and the PARCS & FPS-85 radar stations transferred to Strategic Air Command (then Space Command) in 1983. By 1981 Cheyenne Mountain was providing 6,700 messages per hour including those based on {{input from the}} PAVE PAWS and the remaining FSS-7 stations. In 1981, {{as part of the}} Worldwide Military Command and Control System Information System (WIS), the Pentagon's National Military Command Center was receiving data [...] "directly from the Satellite Early Warning System (SEWS) and directly from the PAVE PAWS sensor systems".|$|E

2500|$|A 1947 {{proposal}} for 411 radar stations and 18 control centers costing $600 million was the Project Supremacy {{plan for a}} postwar Radar Fence that was rejected by Air Defense Command since [...] "no provision was made {{in it for the}} Alaska to Greenland net with flanks guarded by aircraft and picket ships [...] for 3 to 6 hours of warning time", and [...] "Congress failed to act on legislation required to support the proposed system". [...] (In {{the spring and summer of}} 1947, 3 ADC AC plans had gone unfunded.)

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Naval Academy, Parkinson opted to perform regular Air Force duty in order to, as he put it, “find out what the Air Force was all about”. [...] He served two years as a chief Communications-Electronics officer at an early <b>warning</b> <b>station</b> Southeast Asia. [...] Parkinson again {{returned}} to combat duty in Vietnam in 1969, after finishing his Ph.D. at Stanford. [...] His assignment was to refine and improve the AC-130 Spectre gunship, and {{he was sent to}} the field in order to gain an understanding of how the technology performed in real-life situations. [...] During this period he logged more than 170 hours of combat missions, and was awarded a number of military honors including the Bronze Star, Legion of Honor, Meritorious Service Medal and a Presidential Unit Citation. [...] Over the course of his life, Parkinson served twenty-one years in the Air Force, from 1957 to 1978. Parkinson was an academic instructor for test pilots at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, He retired at the rank of colonel.|$|E
