5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the Haliwa-Saponi Native American tribe {{recognized}} {{by the state of}} North Carolina, Faith Hedgepeth was born in 1992 in Warren County, part of the tribe's traditional territory. Her parents divorced within a year of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, with help from an older sister, in Hollister and Warrenton. Connie Hedgepeth named her third daughter Faith because she believed that was <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to raise a third child when she already had two teenage daughters and a husband with a drug problem.|$|E

When Balan was narrated the script and shown {{sketches}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to wear for the portrayal, she felt uncomfortable. Luthria added, [...] "We couldn't have found anyone better than Vidya for this role. It's a casting that very few would think is viable because {{it is going to}} be nothing like Vidya has done before. But I am confident she will push the envelope as far as she can".|$|E

500|$|The {{second wave}} of {{feminism}} created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language. Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as {{a woman and a}} poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson, [...] "Perhaps as a poet [...] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman." [...] Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet. Adrienne Rich theorized in Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: [...] " [...] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed.</b> ... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time ... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics." ...|$|E

She explained that even though Mercedes was [...] "a nasty cow" [...] because of the feud she was a [...] "woman teetering {{on the verge of}} a massive meltdown". Upon Mercedes telling Riley she has no need to be angry with Silas not sitting trial Morgan said she could tell Mercedes had been [...] "knocked her for six", adding that Mercedes could not [...] "hide anything from us". The journalist added that [...] "Mercedes did what Mercedes does best and decided a randy hook-up [...] was just <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to get her mind off Silas. After slapping on the war paint and selecting her sluttiest outfit, minxy Merc headed to a grotty hotel". She went on to explain that [...] "Mercedes knows she’s sinking. She pretty much admitted it when the doc asked her if she hated him and she replied, “I guess I hate myself a little more...” So why doesn’t she get some help before she totally and utterly loses the plot? [...] we’re missing our tart-with-a-heart Mercedes. We want to see her flirting her way around the village again, but without her finger firmly on the self-destruct button..." ...|$|E

Seeing this, Abi calls him hypocritical, before revealing {{that she saw}} him kissing Lucy days before she was killed and they were having an affair. Max urges Abi {{to keep it a}} secret, but Phil discovers the affair from Jay and tells Ian. Abi proceeds to move into Cora's new flat with Lauren. She eventually forgives Max and returns home. Her final A Level results come through, and she tells everyone that she has got <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to get into the University of Liverpool. However, she later confides in Jay that she has been lying, as not to disappoint her family. He encourages her to go through clearing, and she gets a position doing a similar course at the University of Bolton. Jay decides to go with Abi, which Max at first is opposed to, but he comes around eventually. Ben returns from prison and reunites Jay and Phil, and Jay agrees to attend Phil's wedding to Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean), holding off on going to Bolton. At the wedding, Phil's aunt, Sal (Anna Karen), comments that she believed Lola to be Jay's girlfriend. Ben then reveals he thinks Jay is in love with Lola, and he confesses this to Abi when she confronts him. He then ends things to stay in Walford. Devastated, she wants to leave for Bolton immediately, but when Max refuses to take her, she drives the car herself, accidentally running over Tramp, killing him; she callously declares that [...] "things die".|$|E

2500|$|Josephine {{is quoted}} in I Married Wyatt Earp that she {{received}} a letter and $300 from her father, urging her to return to San Francisco. The money was to cover her return trip, and it was ten times <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> for the fare, {{and there is no}} record of him having sent the money to her. Rather than leave Tombstone, Josephine later wrote that Behan convinced her to use the money to build a house for them and continued their relationship. At the time, her parents, her sister Henrietta, and her brother Nathan were all living in a lower-class neighborhood south of Market Street in San Francisco with their daughter, her husband, [...] their four children, and a boarder. Her father worked as a baker. It is unlikely that he was a [...] "wealthy German merchant" [...] as she described him.|$|E
2500|$|Gunsmoke {{was often}} a somber program, {{particularly}} in its early years. Dunning writes that Dillon [...] "played his hand and often lost. He arrived too late to prevent a lynching. He amputated a dying man's leg and lost the patient anyway. He saved a girl from brutal rapists then found himself unable to offer her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to stop her from moving into ... life as a prostitute." [...] Some listeners, such as Dunning, argue the radio version was more realistic. Episodes were aimed at adults and featured {{some of the most}} explicit content of their time, including violent crimes, scalpings, , and opium addicts. Many episodes ended on a somber note, and villains often got away with their crimes. Nonetheless, due to the subtle scripts and outstanding ensemble cast, over the years, the program evolved into a warm, often humorous celebration of human nature.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2002, it was {{announced}} that Bradley Bell had decided to kill off Taylor, and Tylo would depart the role after twelve years. In a statement on her website, she wrote: [...] "It is with great sadness I {{have to tell you that}} Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word, played out." [...] The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction at the time of her exit, saying: [...] "I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere." [...] Tylo said that [...] "It just seemed like everything had to do with whether or not there was a woman after her husband" [...] and that she was [...] "done with it", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show. Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a [...] "brick wall", but Bell was [...] "afraid to go beyond that" [...] and have the character go [...] "off the deep end", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> – to be more human. But she just got boring instead". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|By her own admission, {{she was not}} {{a success}} at first. [...] She only made about $25 during her first month, and all she could afford for her office was two chairs and a {{borrowed}} typewriter. [...] As she told a reporter in a 1934 interview, [...] "I had no clients. And I had no money. [...] But I had great hopes." [...] However, in order to become successful, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> was some experience, so she did volunteer work with the local Legal Aid Society, where she not only got that experience but got involved with an important case about suffrage. [...] As a child, her mother had taken her to see famous suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw giving talks about women's rights. [...] And the belief that women should be treated as equals under the law undoubtedly resonated with her even more {{as a result of her}} struggles to be taken seriously as an attorney. [...] She became even more interested in politics, and more committed to the cause of women's suffrage. [...] She was active in the Women's Suffrage Party and began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. And she argued one particular case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court: thanks to her efforts, she won the women of East Cleveland the right to vote in municipal elections. [...] During this time, she also became involved in another cause, one that would be important to her all of her life: [...] disarmament and the quest for world peace. [...] For Allen, this was personal: [...] both of her brothers died while serving their country during the First World War.|$|E
