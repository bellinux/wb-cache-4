The looting was focused on the best parts of the sculptures, principally the head with the enigmatic eyes. Only later the area was purchased and excavation campaigns began.|$|E

No sooner had Peter been made comfortable in the old house behind the big stump on the hill where Prickly Porky lives than the four scamps began to wonder who else they could scare with the terrible creature <b>without</b> <b>head,</b> legs, or tail which had so frightened Reddy and Old Granny Fox.|$|E

This article challenges the previous notion that the fusiform gyrus was solely involved in the processing of faces, and suggests that this brain region {{is involved in the}} processing of various different category-selective representations. This was established through two experiments, the first involved comparisons of faces, bodies <b>without</b> <b>heads,</b> tools and scenes to determine the region of interest activation levels, the second used human-like stick figures to determine if body recognition occurred in more abstract representations. The authors determined that indeed, activation in the FBA was the highest when participants were shown bodies <b>without</b> <b>heads,</b> but also when stick figures resembled a human body.|$|R

He knew it would be a foolish thing to do, for he might walk right into danger. He knew that little Mrs. Peter was waiting for him over in the dear Old Briar-patch and that she would worry, for he ought to be there this very blessed minute. But he was very curious to know what had frightened Reddy so, and his curiosity, which has led him into so many scrapes, grew greater with every passing minute.|$|E

He stopped only long enough for one good look and then he started for {{the bottom of the hill}} as fast as he could make his legs go. Now, it is a very bad plan to run fast down-hill. Yes, Sir, it is a very bad plan. You see, once you are started, it is not the easiest thing in the world to stop. And then again, you are quite likely to stub your toes.|$|E

The crucial distinction between the canards with and <b>without</b> <b>heads</b> is {{the direction in which}} they leave the repelling branch. We note that for the parameter values chosen in Equations 1 a- 1 b, the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical. Other parameter choices can make this Hopf bifurcation subcritical, resulting in bistablility between the fixed point and relaxation oscillation. In that case the small amplitude oscillations near onset and the headless canards are unstable, the maximal canard corresponds to a saddle-node of periodic orbits of the full system, and the canards with heads and the relaxation oscillations are stable. In addition, the canards with and <b>without</b> <b>heads</b> coexist in phase space at the same I values. A more detailed description of the classical phenomenon of canards in planar systems and analysis techniques can be found in [28 â€“ 31].|$|R

First he went over to the home of Reddy and Granny Fox and invited them to come over to the hill where Prickly Porky lives and see the terrible creature which had frightened them so give Old Man Coyote a scare. Both Reddy and Granny promptly said they would do nothing of the kind, that probably Sammy was engaged in some kind of mischief, and that anyway they knew that there was no such creature <b>without</b> <b>head,</b> legs, or tail, and though they had been fooled once, they didn't propose to be fooled again.|$|E

So when Jimmy Skunk, who had made a special call on Prickly Porky to find out if he had seen the strange creature <b>without</b> <b>head,</b> tail, or legs, told everybody that Prickly Porky had seen nothing of such a creature, he was very much put out and quite offended to hear that Unc' Billy was telling how Prickly Porky had said that Peter might really have some reason for his queer story. It seemed to him that either Prickly Porky had told an untruth or that Unc' Billy was telling an untruth. It made him very angry.|$|E

The council of the nation, which was formed of the clashing factions of a few great men, (for the rest were nothing,) divided, disheartened, weakened, <b>without</b> <b>head,</b> without direction, dismayed by a terrible defeat, submitted, because they saw no other course, to a conqueror whose valor they had experienced, and who had hitherto behaved with great appearances of equity and moderation.

40|$|Faces {{and bodies}} are more {{difficult}} to perceive when presented inverted than when presented upright (i. e., stimulus inversion effect), an effect that has been attributed to the disruption of holistic processing. The features that can trigger holistic processing in faces and bodies, however, still remain elusive. In this study, using a sequential matching task, we tested whether stimulus inversion affects various categories of visual stimuli: faces, faceless heads, faceless heads in body context, headless bodies naked, whole bodies naked, headless bodies clothed, and whole bodies clothed. Both accuracy and inversion efficiency score results show inversion effects for all categories but for clothed bodies (with and <b>without</b> <b>heads).</b> In addition, the magnitude of the inversion effect for face, naked body, and faceless heads was similar. Our findings demonstrate that the perception of faces, faceless heads, and naked bodies relies on holistic processing. Clothed bodies (with and <b>without</b> <b>heads),</b> on the other side, may trigger clothes-sensitive rather than bodysensitive perceptual mechanisms...|$|R
