Data were collected through direct interview <b>with</b> <b>traditional</b> herb <b>sellers</b> using unstructured questionnaires. Study revealed a total of 41 plants species belonging to 23 families. Botanical and local names, plant part used, methods of preparation and administration are described. The part of the plants most frequently used was the leaves 55 %, stem bark (14 %), root (11 %), whole plant (9 %), sap (5 %), aerial parts, flowers and fruits (2 %) each. There was a high degree of informant consensus for the family Sapindaceae while oral and topical routes of administration are commonly employed...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Medicinal {{plants have}} been used for the {{treatment}} of disease in many countries. Traditional medicine has a long history in Iran. Medicinal plants are used to treat some of cancer symptoms, such as pain, which is common with all kinds of cancers. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the medicinal plants prescribed by the <b>traditional</b> herbal <b>sellers</b> in North of Iran, Gorgan. Materials and Methods: The study was undertaken in Golestan province in the North of Iran. We conducted open interviews <b>with</b> all of <b>traditional</b> <b>sellers</b> of medicinal plants in Gorgan. All of the interviews were tape recorded. The data were coded and categorized as it is usual in qualitative methods. Results: The current survey revealed that thirteen medicinal plants and also some of the vegetables and fruits such as carrot, tomato and garlic are prescribed by the <b>traditional</b> <b>sellers</b> for the cancer remedy. Rosemary, Borage, Salix aegyptiaca are wellknown plants for pain remedy of cancer. Milk Thistle, Common Corncokle, Fumitory, Milfoil, Quercus, and Rubra also are recommended for a variety of cancers, such as skin and stomach cancer. Conclusion: The data indicated that the use of herbal remedies is very common. Their use seems to be cultural, rather than attributable to decreased access to health care. Most herbs used pose no threat to health. In some cases, remedies may be blended <b>with</b> <b>traditional</b> medical treatments to ensure better patient compliance...|$|R
40|$|Pay What You Want (PWYW) {{can be an}} {{attractive}} marketing strategy to price discriminate between fair-minded and selfish customers, to fully penetrate a market without giving away the product for free, and to undercut competitors that use posted prices. We report on laboratory experiments that identify causal factors determining the willingness of buyers to pay voluntarily under PWYW. Furthermore, to see how competition affects the viability of PWYW, we implement markets in which a PWYW <b>seller</b> competes <b>with</b> a <b>traditional</b> <b>seller.</b> Finally, we endogenize the market structure and let sellers choose their pricing strategy. The experimental results show that outcome-based social preferences and strategic considerations to keep the seller in the market can explain why and how much buyers pay voluntarily to a PWYW seller. We find that PWYW can be viable in isolation, but it is less successful as a competitive strategy {{because it does not}} drive <b>traditional</b> posted-price <b>sellers</b> out of the market. Instead, the existence of a posted-price competitor reduces buyers 2 ̆ 019 payments and prevents the PWYW seller from fully penetrating the market. If given the choice, the majority of sellers opt for setting a posted price rather than a PWYW pricing. We discuss the implications of these results for the use of PWYW as a marketing strategy...|$|R

However, in such a digital environment, a seller can experiment different prices {{in order to maximize}} his profits. In this paper, we develop a dynamic pricing model to solve the pricing problem of a Web-store, where seller sets a fixed price and buyer either accepts or doesn’t buy. Frequent price changes occur due to current market conditions. The model is based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution (indexed by scale and shape parameters), which is used as the underlying distribution of a random variable X representing the amount of revenue received in the specified time period, say, day. In determining (via testing the expected value of X) whether or not the new product selling price c is accepted, one wants the most effective sample size n of observations X 1, …, Xn of the random variable X and the test plan for the specified seller risk of Type I (probability of rejecting c which is adequate for the real business situation) and seller risk of Type II (probability of accepting c which is not adequate for the real business situation). Let μ 1 be the expected value of X in order to accept c, and μ 2 be the expected value of X in order to reject c, where μ 1 [*]>[*]μ 2, then the test plan has to satisfy the following constraints: (i) Pr{statistically reject c | E{X} = μ 1 } = α 1 (seller risk of Type I), and (ii) Pr{statistically accept c | E{X} = μ 2 } = α 2 (seller risk of Type II). It is assumed that α 1 [*]< 0. 5 and α 2 [*]< 0. 5. The cases of product pricing are considered when the shape parameter of the two-parameter Weibull distribution is assumed to be a priori known as well as when it is unknown...|$|R

In this position, Uber requires minimal capital and takes a cut of every transaction facilitated by its smartphone app. Two-sided platforms have the property {{of being able to}} scale extremely well through a flywheel-like virtuous circle: more riders attract more drivers, which attract more riders, which attract more drivers, etc. Uber grew at an unprecedented rate for a physical (as opposed to purely virtual) business (Lien 2015). At the same time, the company is reported to not yet be profitable, with customer acquisition costs being suspected as the main imbalance between revenues and expenses (Rogowsky 2017). Competition is also intense, forcing Uber to exit the Chinese market; Lyft (another US-based ride-share startup) is also growing rapidly after heavy investments—including from Chinese investors and General Motors—and powerful partnerships with Delta airlines, Starbucks, Google’s Waymo self-driving car subsidiary, and others.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{traditional}} {{market is}} increasingly squeezed by {{the emergence of}} modern market that develops rapidly. The dominance shift in national retail is apparent when globalization can no longer be contained, let alone be banned. Middle class and small class (traditional market) business retail seem to be in increasingly difficult condition to compete with upscale retail business (modern market). The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the factors influencing the competitiveness of traditional market and to develop policies to improve the competitiveness of traditional market. This study utilizes research strategy of case study in Bandung City, Serang City, and Surabaya City with qualitative descriptive approach. The study shows that the factors inhibiting the competitiveness of <b>traditional</b> market <b>with</b> modern stores are (1) Traditional market’s bad image, and (2) <b>Traditional</b> market’s <b>sellers</b> and managers are unprofessional. To improve the competitiveness of traditional market, this study recommends: (1) routine and regular maintenance of buildings and infrastructure of traditional market, (2) professionalism improvement of <b>traditional</b> market’s <b>sellers</b> and managers, and (3) the partiality of local government in traditional markets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{competitive}} {{dynamics of}} the early 21 st century competition are being reshaped. Much has changed {{in recent years as}} the rise of artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful force. Less understood, but overwhelmingly felt, the change is shattering the <b>traditional</b> vertical boundaries. <b>With</b> tech firms now encroaching the traditional verticals, the need for strategic realignment is apparent. Non-tech firms are responding with acquiring tech firms. Tech firms are responding with trespassing into the non-tech domains. This creates a wicked problem for traditional non-tech firms: <b>traditional</b> <b>sellers</b> of technology are now becoming fierce competitors andtraditional non-tech firms must adapt to this new reality by developing technology of their own. This paper adds to the literature in various ways. First, the paper presents a model that captures the unique properties of artificial intelligence competition. Second, the paper argues that to stay competitive non-tech firms would need to acquire multidisciplinary innovation capability as well as embrace high-performance innovation culture. Keywords.
