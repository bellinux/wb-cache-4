[...] "As you get older and have children, your reflections on what matters begin to change." [...] Raymond says [...] "I started slowing it down," [...] he went on, [...] "enjoying the places I went, going to museums, understanding the nature of what artists were trying to say."

The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5.

[...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking?

500|$|The heavy metal-inspired {{world of}} Brütal Legend was also well received, and {{considered}} {{to show a}} clear reverence for the genre. [...] Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be [...] "dedicated to an unabashed love of metal" [...] and [...] "heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree". Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements {{that made up the}} heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being [...] "both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass" [...] at the same time. Critics found that while the graphics for the game {{may not be the most}} sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that [...] "no matter <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the world, there's always some cool object to look at", while Donlan considered the world to be a [...] "constant unfolding delight". The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's [...] "Through the Fire and Flames" [...] would be used as background music during specific game sequences. Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music. Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have [...] "enormous breadth of sound and diversity", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed. G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of [...] "taking a class in heavy metal appreciation." ...|$|E

Nadine has delivered a real album with musical integrity and, most of all, that great big warm voice and fantastic songs which we believe will speak to all of Tesco's customers." [...] The album itself will be released through Nadine's own label Black Pen Records. [...] "The traditional model for selling an album isn't {{the only way of}} doing things," [...] Nadine said.

2500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast {{described}} Hustle's filming schedule as incredibly hectic. Vaughn said that [...] " [...] was offered to me, and I was told {{to get on a}} plane an hour after I got the phone call and start shooting the following day." [...] Speaking in 2009 after filming four series of the show, Lester explained that [...] "when we start shooting Hustle we film two episodes concurrently, with the scenes out of sequence. Knowing <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging". Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. [...] "It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed to be calm, cool and collected... she looks down, checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. I kept looking down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you'll see is me laughing".|$|E

[...] "I wrote {{a lot of}} songs inspired, in a way, by what I was going through {{at the time that}} this album was being made, and he was definitely a big part of that," [...] she told MTV News. The singer took more of a [...] "hands-on role", co-writing more material than she had on her previous albums. The album was titled This Is Me... Then, as it was something she wanted to look back on in retrospection. Lopez explained, [...] "Who you are at that time, what kind of music you like, what kind of beats you're into, what kind of state of mind you're in, what you're attracted to ... it's all very telling of <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> your life at that point. ... Twenty years from now, if I give this [...] to one of my kids, I'll be like, 'This was me then, at that moment.'" [...] Lopez dedicated the album to Affleck, with the words [...] "You are my life ... my sole inspiration for every lyric, every emotion, every bit of feeling on this record" [...] written on the disc jacket.|$|E
