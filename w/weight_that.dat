5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his <b>weight</b> <b>that</b> is directed downward.|$|E
5|$|Following Against All Odds, Team 3D {{were forced}} to weigh in before each contest, which created a feud with the team of Curry Man and Shark Boy, leading to a Fish Market Street Fight between the two teams, with the {{stipulation}} that if Team 3D could not make weight they would be fired from TNA. At the event, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made <b>weight</b> <b>that</b> night {{they would not have}} to abide by a weight restriction henceforth. Team 3D marked in below the mark prior to the contest; however eventually lost the encounter.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons <b>weight</b> <b>that</b> rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{did work}} for {{publishers}} other than Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation on his part, and partly to Dick Giordano's inking, which exhibited a different line <b>weight.</b> <b>That</b> same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist if he took the job, told Schultz he would only do it if she could get Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility in handling comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E

25|$|British William Prout first {{proposed}} ordering {{all the elements}} by their atomic weight as all atoms had a <b>weight</b> <b>that</b> was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J. A. R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements in the 1860s by Dmitri Mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including Julius Lothar Meyer. The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh {{at the end of}} the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.|$|E

A different study predicts 0.08–0.16% (weight) hydrogen in the inner core, while others proposed from 50% to 95% FeH (by mole count) If the core has this much hydrogen it would amount to ten times as much as in the oceans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the Euclidean setting, the A ∞ weights {{satisfy a}} Reverse Hölder Inequality (RHI) but in spaces of {{homogeneous}} type {{the best known}} result has been <b>that</b> A ∞ <b>weights</b> satisfy only a weak Reverse Hölder Inequality. In this paper, we compliment the results of Hytönen, Pérez and Rela and show that there exist both A ∞ <b>weights</b> <b>that</b> do not satisfy an RHI and a genuinely weaker <b>weight</b> class <b>that</b> still satisfies a weak RHI. We also show <b>that</b> all the <b>weights</b> <b>that</b> satisfy a weak RHI have a self-improving property but the self-improving property of the strong Reverse Hölder weights fails in a general space of homogeneous type. We prove most of these purely non-dyadic results using convenient dyadic systems and techniques. 1...|$|R
