5000|$|Steel-cut oats (US), {{also called}} pinhead oats, coarse oatmeal (UK), or Irish oatmeal are groats (the inner kernel with the {{inedible}} hull removed) of whole oats {{which have been}} chopped into two or three pieces. The pieces can then be processed further to make rolled oat flakes, of smaller size than flakes of <b>whole</b> <b>groats,</b> or sold for consumption as [...] "steel-cut oats".|$|E
5000|$|Oats for {{porridge}} may be <b>whole</b> (<b>groats),</b> {{cut into}} {{two or three}} pieces (called [...] "pinhead", [...] "steel-cut" [...] or [...] "coarse" [...] oatmeal), ground into medium or fine oatmeal, or steamed and rolled into flakes of varying sizes and thicknesses (called [...] "rolled oats", the largest size being [...] "jumbo"). The larger the pieces of oat used, the more textured the resulting porridge. It is said that, because of their size and shape, the body breaks steel-cut oats down more slowly than rolled oats, reducing spikes in blood sugar and making the eater feel full longer. The US Consumer Reports Web site found that the more cooking required, the stronger the oat flavor and the less mushy the texture.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{consequences}} of pearling and cutting (barley Hordeum vulgare L.), and roasting and cutting (buckwheat Fagopyrum es-culentum Möench) {{on the development}} and food consumption of the confused flour beetle Tribolium confusum Duv. were studied. The factors affecting {{the increase in the}} T. confusum population, and food consumption effectiveness (the proportion of wasted food in the whole amount of the used product) were different in barley and buckwheat. The best barley product for T. confusum was the flour. The population number, the proportion of imagines, and the effectiveness of food consumption were relatively high for cut groats, compared to whole barley. The toughness of the <b>whole</b> <b>groats</b> was most likely the cause of the lowest suitability of this product for the confused flour beetle. Neither the size of the cut groats nor the pearling of barley had any effect on T. confusum development and food consumption effectiveness. The best buckwheat product for T. confusum was the whole hulled non-processed groats. In these groats, the total population number, the proportion of imagines, and the effectiveness of food consumption were relatively high compared to cut groats. The total population number was the lowest in the steamed groats. The decrease in nutrients and B vitamins due to the removal of the embryo and aleurone layer during the breaking process of buckwheat, was possibly the main factor affecting T. confu-sum development and food consumption in buckwheat.

2500|$|Many <b>whole</b> oat <b>groats</b> break {{during the}} {{dehulling}} process, leaving the following types of groats to be sized and separated for further processing: <b>whole</b> oat <b>groats,</b> coarse steel cut groats, steel cut groats, and fine steel cut groats. Groats are sized and separated using screens, shakers and indent screens. After the <b>whole</b> oat <b>groats</b> are separated, the remaining broken groats get sized {{again into the}} three groups (coarse, regular, fine), and then stored. [...] "Steel cut" [...] refers to all sized or cut groats. When not enough broken groats are available to size for further processing, <b>whole</b> oat <b>groats</b> are sent to a cutting unit with steel blades that evenly cut groats into the three sizes above.|$|R
50|$|Rolled oats are steamed and {{flattened}} <b>whole</b> oat <b>groats.</b> Old-fashioned oats can be {{thick and}} {{take a while to}} boil to make porridge. Quick-cooking rolled oats (quick oats) are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. Instant oatmeal is precooked and dried, often with a sweetener, such as sugar, and flavourings added.|$|R
50|$|This process uses {{two large}} smooth or {{corrugated}} rolls spinning {{at the same}} speed in opposite directions at a controlled distance. Oat flakes, also known as rolled oats, have many different sizes, thicknesses and other characteristics {{depending on the size of}} oat groats passed between the rolls. Typically, the three sizes of steel cut oats are used to make instant, baby and quick rolled oats, whereas <b>whole</b> oat <b>groats</b> are used to make regular, medium and thick rolled oats. Oat flakes range in thickness from 0.36 mm to 1.00 mm.|$|R
40|$|An enzymatic assay {{designed}} for measurement of β-glucan in barley was modified to allow measurement of total β-glucan content in oats by manipulating the grinding and incubation protocol. Using the modified enzymatic assay, {{the range of}} genetic and environmental variation of β-glucan content in Canadian domestic and breeder's lines of oats was assessed using several cultivars grown in 5 locations in eastern Canada in 3 growing seasons. Analysis of variance indicated that the predominant source of variation was genetic. A second assay using Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) to measure β-glucan was also evaluated. Although a high correlation was observed {{for the results of}} the two methods (r = 0. 90), the results obtained using FIA tended to be somewhat lower than those obtained using the modified enzymatic assay: the enzymatic assay was judged to be more accurate for estimation of total β-glucan in oats. Nevertheless, because of its greater speed and simplicity, FIA would be a valuable screening tool for routine-applications. Using the enzymatic assay, β-glucan content was also measured in 18 primitive species of Avena to evaluate possible sources of germplasm for expanding the range of β-glucan content currently available in domestic cultivars. A comparison of β-glucan content with protein content, oil content and thousand kernel weight in domestic oats showed that these quality parameters are independent of β-glucan concentration in oats. Scanning microspectrofluorometry was used to map β-glucan distribution in single kernels of oats: differences were observed within single kernels, and also among kernels from different cultivars of oats. Microscopic examination suggests that the different distribution patterns are due to differences in cell wall thickness adjacent to the germ and around the periphery of the kernel, and also to differences in cell size and shape in the central endosperm. A high β-glucan (Marion) and a low β-glucan oat cultivar (OA 516 - 2) were selected for isolation and preliminary characterization of the endosperm cell walls, which are the major source of β-glucan in the oat kernel. It was concluded that the differences in β-glucan content that were observed in <b>whole</b> <b>groats</b> were not due to differences in the composition of isolated endosperm cell walls, but to variation in cell size and cell wall thickness in different areas of the groats.
