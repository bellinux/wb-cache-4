5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise {{on the art of}} drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although <b>wrapping</b> paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using <b>wrapping</b> paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and <b>wrapping</b> during the Tang era.|$|E

5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and <b>wrapping</b> coloured threads. The <b>wrapping</b> threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E

40|$|Background: Aortomyoplasty is a {{treatment}} for heart failure in which the latissimus dorsi muscle is <b>wrapped</b> around the aorta and stimulated to contract during diastole to provide chronic diastolic counterpulsation. We hypothesized that {{the manner in which}} the latissimus dorsi muscle is <b>wrapped</b> around the aorta determines the effectiveness of counterpulsation. Methods: Nine mongrel dogs were studied. The left latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) was isolated and <b>wrapped</b> around the descending thoracic aorta using three different muscle <b>wrap</b> techniques- a helical coil (HC) <b>wrap,</b> a circumferential (CM) <b>wrap,</b> and a “wringer” (WR) <b>wrap.</b> The three <b>wraps</b> were done in each dog. Left-ventricular and aortic pressures and coronary and aortic blood flows proximal and distal to the muscle-wrapped region were measured. Mean diastolic aortic pressure, endocardial-viability ratio, coronary blood flow, and blood volume ejected from the <b>wrapped</b> segment (<b>wrap</b> stroke volume) were calculated. Results: <b>Wrap</b> stroke volume was greater for the WR (5. 24 ± 1. 00 mL, p< 0. 05 compared with HC), compared with the CM (3. 70 ± 0. 64 mL) or the HC (1. 96 ± 0. 83 mL). The increases in mean diastolic aortic pressure were similar for the WR (10. 6 ± 4. 7 %) and CM (9. 7 ± 4. 4 %) <b>wraps</b> and these were greater than the HC <b>wrap</b> (4. 9 ± 4. 7 %). Endocardialviability ratio was increased similarly by the WR (19. 3 ± 10. 8 %) and CM (19. 8 ± 14. 6 %) <b>wraps</b> and these increases were greater than observed during the HC <b>wrap</b> (10. 5 ± 6. 3 %). The WR <b>wrap</b> provided the greatest increase in coronary blood flow (24. 3 ± 23. 0 %) compared with the CM (17. 8 ± 12. 9 %) and HC (5. 7 ± 4. 6 %). Conclusion: These data suggest that: 1) all muscle <b>wrap</b> techniques effect diastolic counterpulsation; 2) muscle <b>wrap</b> orientation influences ameliorative potential; and 3) wringer and adjacent are better than helical coil. Chronic studies should be done to test whether the differences are maintained. Key words: aortomyoplasty, diastolic counterpulsation, skeletal muscle cardiac assist. Basic Appl.

5|$|Stelae were {{considered}} to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and {{were considered}} to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was closely tied to the k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of <b>wrapping</b> or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K'iche' Maya practice of <b>wrapping</b> small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E

40|$|Esophageal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly aggressive cancer whose underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The natural antisense transcript (NAT) <b>WRAP</b> 53 regulates p 53 expression and <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein is a component of telomerase. NATs play key roles in carcinogenesis, and although <b>WRAP</b> 53 is known to increase cancer cell survival, its role in ESCC clinicopathology is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>WRAP</b> 53 expression in ESCC and to correlate it with clinicopathological characteristics. <b>WRAP</b> 53 mRNA and protein expression was measured by quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, respectively, in 4 ESSC cells lines and in 45 paired ESCC and non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa tissues. To correlate <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein expression with clinicopathological characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 134 ESCC and 85 non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa tissues. Expression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 was detected in all ESCC cell lines and was upregulated in the ESCC tissues compared with the corresponding non-neoplastic tissues (P< 0. 01). More cells expressed <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein in the ESCC tissues than in the non-neoplastic tissues (P< 0. 01). Overexpression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 was significantly correlated with tumor infiltration depth (P =  0. 000), clinical stage (P =  0. 001), and lymph node metastasis (P =  0. 025). <b>Wrap</b> 53 expression was not correlated with age, gender, or tumor differentiation. This report indicates increased expression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 in ESCC and that <b>WRAP</b> 53 overexpression is correlated with tumor progression. <b>WRAP</b> 53 may play a significant role in ESCC; accordingly, <b>WRAP</b> 53 could be a useful biomarker for ESCC...|$|R
