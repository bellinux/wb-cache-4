5|$|A recent calm period, <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> {{earthquake}} or magmatic {{activity at}} Hualālai, {{has seen the}} growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|By 22:15 {{the brigade}} had secured {{all of its}} day one {{objectives}} {{and some of the}} missing men had arrived in the brigade area. However, there were many still unaccounted for. The 4th Parachute Battalion numbered around 200 men <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> heavy weapons. The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion had 317 men. There were only enough men of the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion to guard the approach roads leading to the drop zone from the north.|$|E
5000|$|The bar {{was known}} for its {{uninhibited}} sexual and sometimes violent atmosphere. Its [...] "Ladies Night" [...] was especially notorious, with male strippers entertaining a packed bar filled <b>with</b> women paying <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> entrance fee and consuming free drinks.|$|R

5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E
5|$|Malawi's {{climate is}} {{hot in the}} low-lying areas {{in the south of}} the country and {{temperate}} in the northern highlands. The altitude moderates what would otherwise be an equatorial climate. Between November and April the temperature is warm with equatorial rains and thunderstorms, with the storms reaching their peak severity in late March. After March, the rainfall rapidly diminishes and from May to September wet mists float from the highlands into the plateaus, <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> rainfall during these months.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus {{is known}} from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located in Niger. It {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} found vertebrates in the formation. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> fine-grained horizons. Nigersaurus lived in what is now Niger about 115 to 105 million years ago, during the Aptian and Albian ages of the mid-Cretaceous. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone).|$|E
30|$|The case {{relates to}} a bookstore owner {{claiming}} that two DM- 41 hand grenades were exploded simultaneously in his store. There were three males {{together at the}} store when the explosion occurred. One was the owner who claimed that he escaped after the explosion without any harm; the other was at the corner lying down to prevent his body from the explosion effect. He survived <b>with</b> very minor, <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> effects.|$|R

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> land left {{to develop}} for housing, Teaneck's {{population}} {{is likely to}} remain stable for the foreseeable future. A reluctance to permit high-rise development as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth. Changes in family size and the possibility of zoning changes to allow denser construction are some of the few influences that may affect population over time.|$|E
5|$|About {{two months}} into the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments {{and is a}} common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.|$|E

50|$|A direct {{acoustic}} {{cochlear implant}} - also DACI - is an acoustic implant which converts sound in mechanical vibrations that stimulate directly the perilymph inside the cochlea. The hearing {{function of the}} external and middle ear is being taken over by a little motor of a cochlear implant, directly stimulating the cochlea. With a DACI, people <b>with</b> <b>no</b> or <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> residual hearing but with a still functioning inner ear, can again perceive speech, sounds and music.DACI is an official product category, {{as indicated by the}} nomenclature of GMDN.|$|R
30|$|The {{data from}} the {{building}} follows certain patterns. That is, around 7.00 {{in the morning the}} temperature measurements in the four rooms starts to rise as does the CO 2 ppm concentration. Accordingly, the radiator valves close (due to higher temperature) and the desired valve opening of the ventilation unit increases (due to higher CO 2 concentration). The valve opening of the ventilation unit then accordingly also increases. Around 16.00 in the afternoon these sensors fall back to evening/nighttime operating conditions <b>with</b> <b>no</b> or <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> occupancy. Also, on weekends (Saturday, Sunday and other holidays), the variables do not follow the same patterns as in the working days (Monday to Friday), but seem to follow patterns of <b>no</b> or <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> occupancy.|$|R
5|$|Because both {{methanol}} {{and carbon}} monoxide are commodity raw materials, methanol carbonylation long {{appeared to be}} attractive precursors to acetic acid. Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925. However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high pressures needed (200 atm or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process, which used a cobalt catalyst, was developed by German chemical company BASF in 1963. In 1968, a rhodium-based catalyst (cis−−) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> by-products. US chemical company Monsanto Company built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see Monsanto process). In the late 1990s, the chemicals company BP Chemicals commercialised the Cativa catalyst (−), which is promoted by iridium for greater efficiency. This iridium-catalyzed Cativa process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th {{century the}} native Welsh princes built {{a number of}} stone castles. The size of these varied {{considerably}} from smaller fortifications, such as Dinas Emrys in Snowdonia, to more substantial castles like Deganwy Castle and the largest, Castell y Bere. Native Welsh castles typically maximised the defensive benefits of high, mountainous sites, often being built in an irregular shape to fit a rocky peak. Most had deep ditches {{cut out of the}} rock to protect the main castle. The Welsh castles were usually built with a relatively short keep, used as living accommodation for princes and nobility, and with distinctive rectangular watch-towers along the walls. In comparison to Norman castles the gatehouses were much weaker in design, <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> use of portcullises or spiral staircases, and the stonework of the outer walls was also generally inferior to Norman built castles. The very last native Welsh castles, built in the 1260s, more closely resemble Norman designs; in the case of Dinas Brân including a round keep and Norman gatehouse defences.|$|E
5|$|French {{sabotage}} by the FFI, {{together with}} the Allied bombing, severed German communication lines, causing initial confusion among the troops. German field commanders {{were not able to}} communicate with Army GroupG's headquarters. Despite the hampered communications, German commanders acted independently to put measures in effect to counter the Allied invasion. Directly facing the brunt of the Allied landings was the German LXII Corps at Draguignan, commanded by Ferdinand Neuling. Allied paratroopers interrupted his communication lines and trapped his headquarters in the city. He therefore ordered the nearby 148th Infantry Division to counterattack against the beaches at LeMuy, just before the Allied paratroopers cut him off completely. Wiese, as commander of the 19th Army, was also unable to contact Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters, but implemented a plan to push the Allied forces in the LeMuySaint-Raphaël region back into the sea unilaterally. <b>With</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> mobile reserves to react against the beach landings, he ordered the commander of the 189th Infantry Division, Richard von Schwerin, to establish an ad-hoc battle group (Kampfgruppe) from all nearby units to counterattack the Allied bridgeheads in this area. While vonSchwerin assembled all the men he could find, the 148th Infantry Division near Draguignan encountered heavy resistance from the FFI, which had been reinforced by British paratroopers, upsetting the plan for a swift counterattack toward the beaches.|$|E

40|$|Monolithic ZrB 2 and TaB 2 were {{produced}} {{starting from the}} precursors through Self-propagating High temperature Synthesis followed by Spark Plasma Sintering (SHS-SPS) and by means of Reactive Spark Plasma Sintering (RSPS). Both methods enabled to achieve almost fully dense ceramics with mean grain size typical of pure bulks. ZrB 2 materials displayed {{significant differences in the}} final mean grain size of the products obtained by the two routes, while a satisfactory homogeneity was reached in both cases. This was confirmed by good mechanical strength values, about 400 MPa at room temperature, basically maintained up to 1200 °C. On the other hand, TaB 2 sintered materials were quite diverse, in particular TaB 2 /RSPS showed a dual distribution of mean grain size, along <b>with</b> an <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> residual porosity, whilst TaB 2 /SHS-SPS had more homogeneous grain size distribution and diffused trapped porosity which corrupted the mechanical and oxidation performances...|$|R

5|$|The 2005 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 3, 2005, at 8:00p.m. EST. Early {{in the first}} quarter, the Tigers took a 3–0 lead. Following an {{interception}} by the Auburn defense, the Tigers were extended their lead to 6–0. In the second quarter, another field goal resulted in three points for the Tigers. At halftime, Auburn led, 9–0. Auburn opened the second half with its only touchdown drive of the game, giving Auburn a 16–0 lead, which it held into the fourth quarter. In that quarter, Tech scored its first touchdown of the game but did not convert the two-point try, making the score 16–6. Late in the quarter, Tech quarterback Bryan Randall cut Auburn's lead to 16–13 on an 80-yard pass that resulted in another touchdown. <b>With</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> time remaining in the game, Virginia Tech attempted an onside kick to have another chance on offense. When Auburn recovered the kick, the Tigers ran out the clock and secured the win. In recognition of his game-winning performance, Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians entered Valjevo on 15 November, {{prompting}} wild public celebrations in Vienna. Franz Joseph praised Potiorek for {{seizing the}} town; {{cities across the}} empire made Potiorek an honorary citizen and Sarajevo even named a street after him. Valjevo's capture led the Austro-Hungarians {{to believe that they}} {{were on the verge of}} defeating Serbia and that the Serbian Army was no longer a coherent fighting force, but the scorched earth tactics employed by the Serbs during their withdrawal complicated the Austro-Hungarian advance. Although the Austro-Hungarians were right in assuming that the Serbian Army was exhausted, its defensive positions along the Kolubara had been prepared months in advance. Putnik's carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that the losses of the Serbian Army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with the Austro-Hungarians. Moreover, the geography of northwestern Serbia favoured defensive operations since the approaches to the Kolubara did not offer any cover to armies invading from the direction of Austria-Hungary and the river itself was surrounded by mountainous terrain. In October, the Serbs had fortified the Jeljak and Maljen mountain ranges in anticipation of an Austro-Hungarian attack. This gave them an advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as it placed them in control of all roads leading to Kragujevac. The Serbs also established a series of field fortifications blocking the approach to Niš. The extensive series of fortifications and the difficulty of the terrain which they faced left the Austro-Hungarians with no choice but to conduct operations in the gruelling Serbian countryside <b>with</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|With {{less than}} half a quarter {{remaining}} and down by three scores, Virginia Tech had a nearly insurmountable deficit to overcome. The Hokies fielded the kickoff for a touchback, and the Tech offense began at its 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first and second plays of the drive, Vick was sacked for losses. The third play was an incomplete pass, and the Hokies were forced to punt. After fielding the kick at their 38-yard line, Florida State began running out the clock by running the ball. After failing to gain a first down on two consecutive rushes and an incomplete pass, Florida State punted. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Tech's offense began again at its 20-yard line. Vick threw for short yardage, then Kendrick ran for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Vick completed a 23-yard first down pass to Emmet Johnson, and the Hokies entered Florida State territory with the clock ticking steadily down. On the first play in Seminoles' territory, Vick completed another 23-yard pass, this time to Davis, who picked up a first down at the Florida State 23-yard line. Thanks to a holding penalty against the Seminoles, Tech was granted a first down at the State eight-yard line. Vick threw an incomplete pass, ran for three yards, and then threw another pass to a player who was stopped short of the goal line. Facing fourth down and needing just two yards for a touchdown, Tech attempted to pass for the touchdown, but Vick was sacked and turned the ball over on downs with 1:12 remaining. <b>With</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> time remaining, Florida State continued running down the clock and earned the 4629 victory.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} of fruit age, abscisic acid (ABA) concentration, ethylene evolution, and abscission rates were studied {{in an effort}} to determine why cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., cv. Deltapine 16) fruits rarely abscise more than 15 days after anthesis. Because abscission of cotton fruits is increased by conditions that limit photosynthesis, greenhouse-grown plants with fruits of various ages were placed in dim light for 3 days to induce high rates of fruit abscission. Abscission rates, ABA concentrations, and ethylene evolution rates were determined for fruits of various ages. Almost all of the young fruits abscised, but abscission rate declined <b>with</b> age until <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> abscission was observed in fruits that were 15 or more days past anthesis...|$|R
50|$|Armenian {{architecture}} {{employs a}} form of concrete to produce sturdy buildings,.
