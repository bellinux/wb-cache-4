40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our research}} results of visualizing 3 D city model in a <b>web</b> <b>explorer</b> environment under the supports of digital building model (DBM), {{digital terrain model}} (DTM), large-scale true urban orthoimage, and actual building sidewall pictures. A system has initially been designed and developed under a client/server architecture, which integrates Internet GIS with multi-tier web application for creation of 3 D city model. The front-end client provides a user interface for setting properties of the 3 D model, while the backend server processes the parameters and generates the 3 D model, which is then {{sent back to the}} VRML-enabled WWW browser for display and navigation. The technology for display and navigation of the 3 D model is actually a Java JSP/Servlet technology built under multi-tier web architecture. The data accessing and processing of the technology is through Java programming language to link the displayer with the database where the required GIS spatial data are stored. The results from our experiment demonstrated that this developed architecture is able to display and visualize 3 D city data in web environment for public access. Using the sidewall pictures taken from real city buildings, we refill the white walls of urban buildings into a real appearance as seen in our real world city. The player provides several click buttons to change the effect and position of visualization, including rotation, zoom, pan, seek etc. The users can easily to view details of specific building, the entire city in a moving 3 dimensions, to locate a specific building, and so on...|$|E
