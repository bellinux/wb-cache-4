5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt.

The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university.

25|$|In November, as Herman Cain's {{campaign}} was stumbling, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich {{rose in the}} polls and asserted himself as the fourth major opponent to Romney. Gingrich had come back from serious staff problems in his campaign just <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> had entered the race in May that had seemingly derailed his campaign for the nomination. But in the weeks before the Iowa caucus, Gingrich's new-found lead began to quickly evaporate as super PACs sympathetic to Mitt Romney and others spent over $4.4 million in negative advertising targeting the former Speaker. With Gingrich's support faltering, Ron Paul surged to the lead in Iowa. Rick Santorum, who despite spending months traveling to all 99 counties in Iowa and holding some 381 town hall meetings, was polling in the single digits in Iowa as late as December 18. However, in the final weeks of 2011, Santorum positioned himself as the prime opposition to Romney with his staunch socially conservative views.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to force a stop to the Russian advance, some Chechen forces resorted {{to a series of}} {{terrorist}} attacks directed against civilian targets outside the area that they claimed. Basayev led the most famous such attack, the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis on 14 June 1995, less than two <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> lost his family in the air raids. Shamil's large band seized the Budyonnovsk hospital in southern Russia and the 1,600 people inside for a period of several days. At least 129 civilians died and 415 were wounded during the crisis as the Russian special forces repeatedly attempted to free the hostages by force. Although Basayev failed in his principal demand for the removal of Russian forces from Chechnya, he did successfully negotiate a stop to the Russian advance and an initiation of peace talks with the Russian government, saving the Chechen resistance by giving them time to regroup and recover. Basayev and his fighters then returned to Chechnya under cover of the human shields.|$|E
