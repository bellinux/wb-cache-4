40|$|This chapter articulates how the way {{of working}} changed the interiority of office {{buildings}} {{and how it is}} shaping the space between office buildings. The modern office building was originated from bringing workers together in one location, which resulted in gigantic corporate architecture. However, the gigantism did not produce urban rhythm or urbanism due to the Taylorist management. With the human relation movement that emphasised natural groups and social relations to ameliorate hierarchical tensions and to sustain high productivity, workplace was designed to encourage spontaneous, serendipitous social encounter via blurring boundaries of circulation, working and services. The intensive social activities within an office building, representing urban rhythm, significantly changed the building's interiority. The advancement of communication technologies brought forth portable worksphere and nomadic working-style, <b>which</b> <b>engendered</b> <b>a</b> new <b>relationship</b> between office workers and public realm in cities.

40|$|Intent upon harmonizing {{doctrines of}} their predecessors, some Neoplatonic com- mentators {{are faced with}} a problem of resolving doctrinal {{discrepancies}} so as to restore the συμφωνία in the history of philosophy. This article considers a parti- cular example of this attempt ats harmonization: how Simplicius reconciles Aris- totle’s Categories with the Neopythagorean doctrine of the Pseudo-Archytas. The chronological inversion introduced by the counterfeiter produces remarkable effects on the late Platonic doctrine about general terms, to the extent that a commentator such as Simplicius works to reduce the dissonance between Archytas’ and Aristotle’s words. This paper has three aims: to restore the general grid that Simplicius uses for reading and commenting on Archytas through Aristotle; to identify the exegeti- cal strategies aimed at a doctrinal reconciliation; to consider a specific case, pro- vided by the doctrine of weight, <b>which</b> <b>engenders</b> <b>a</b> new physical theory by Simplicius.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{material}} and cultural influences <b>which</b> <b>engender</b> <b>an</b> era’s formal works of political theory are no strangers {{to the opera}} house. In this essay, I analyze Beethoven’s opera Fidelio as a political text influenced by the republican ideas of the later Enlightenment and the French Revolution. The republicanism of Fidelio lies {{not so much in}} its depiction of political institutions. It lies rather in the opera’s emphasis on republican virtue. This virtue consists of gendered sets of patriotic habits, attitudes, and practices. Even Beethoven’s music-bourgeois music at its very height-echoed the turmoil and the ideal of the heroic years of the middle class in merely the same way that a morning dream echoes the noise of the beginning day. It is not actual sensory listening but only the conceptually mediated perception of the elements and their configuration which assures the social substance of great music. -Theodor W. Adorno, Philosophy of Modern Musi...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} late 80 s {{incentive}} regulation has replaced rate of return regulation in many states of the U. S. By creating a profit opportunity, the shift to incentive regulation encourages the regulated utility to reduce its costs, which might result in quality cuts. This paper examines the impact of state incentive regulation on two dimensions of quality of service, the average duration {{and the frequency of}} electric outages in the electric utility industry of the U. S. between 1993 and 1999. The study is based on a panel data set for 78 major utilities from 23 states of the U. S. It finds that incentive regulation is associated with an increase in the average duration of electric outages, but the implementation of explicit quality benchmarks reduces the average duration of outages per customer. This paper also finds that incentive regulation reduces the utility’s operational and maintenance expenses at the distribution level, <b>which</b> <b>engenders</b> <b>an</b> increase in the duration of electric outages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractModerate alcohol {{consumption}} has beneficial effects on endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activation, <b>which</b> can <b>engender</b> <b>an</b> array of anti-atherogenic actions.

These data suggest that ethanol-induced eNOS activation in HAECs may be dependent on ALDH 2 hyperacetylation by SIRT 3 inactivation...|$|R
40|$|Alliances in construction, {{whether in}} the form of partnering {{arrangements}} or strategic commercial <b>relationships,</b> provide <b>a</b> mechanism that can improve inter-organizational relations and project performance. Alliances help construction organizations to achieve their business objectives through collaborative, harmonious commercial relationships. The key to gaining competitive advantage and improving customer satisfaction lies in the ability of construction organizations to form such cooperative "learning" alliances. Essentially, these should be long-term strategic partnerships, <b>which</b> <b>engender</b> <b>an</b> environment to enable mutual and reflective learning (between organizations). It is proffered that cooperative learning alliances enable construction organizations to better consider business decisions that are influenced by this learning climate (bounded rationality), and make best use of the information (opportunism) they encounter. These two concepts impact considerably on transaction costs within organizations. Thus, if construction organizations utilize a mechanism to best capitalize on these facets, then more efficient internal governance structures result. This can be achieved through cooperative learning where ideas, objectives and mission are shared between alliance partners. To demonstrate the effectiveness of cooperative learning alliances, a case study is used to explore their impact on transaction costs...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{biologists}} {{who have}} engaged in {{months or even years}} of field work with Nile crocodiles, including Cott (1961), Graham and Beard (1968) and Guggisberg (1972), have found that with sufficient precautions, their own lives and the lives of their local guides were rarely, if ever, at risk in areas with many crocodiles. However, Guggisberg accumulated several earlier writings that noted the lack of fear of crocodiles among Africans, driven in part perhaps by poverty and superstition, that caused many observed cases of an [...] "appalling" [...] lack of caution within view of large crocodiles, as opposed to the presence of bold lions <b>which</b> <b>engendered</b> <b>an</b> appropriate panic. Per Guggisberg, this disregard (essentially regarding the crocodile as a lowly creature and thus non-threatening to humans) may account for the seemingly higher frequency of deadly attacks by crocodiles than by large mammalian carnivores.

40|$|Password based {{security}} {{is still the}} most prevalent form of controlling access to trusted resources accessed through computers. There are several difficulties associated with password based systems, the predominant one being password memorability. The average person has approximately 15 passwords to maintain, <b>which</b> <b>engenders</b> <b>a</b> significant cognitive burden if passwords are selected and utilised properly. One potential solution to the memorability issue is to provide users with password hints. For instance, literal hints {{in the form of a}} displaying a subset of the actual password characters in situ during have been deployed commercially. Although potentially effective, this approach compromises the password coverage space, effectively weakening the password. Further, this approach may render the password susceptible to shoulder surfing and other means of surveillance. In this work, a compromise was sought between enhancing password memorability while reducing the likelihood of successful surveillance based attacks. The scheme deployed in this work is based on a one-time password scheme (OTP). To enhance memorability, password hints are utilised, which are deployed in the form of pre-attentive hinting. The question explored in this work is whether pre-attentive hinting is sufficient to enhance memorability, without rendering the approach susceptible to a surveillance based attack...|$|R

The presumed sensory threshold may be situated prior to or subsequent tothe point at which the information from the two eyes combines. The location of this threshold was investigated in 3 experiments hat provided conclusions about he location of the sensory thresholds and the mechanisms ofbinocular combination. It is concluded that a linear summation mechanism, an independent sampling information acquisition model, and both pre- and postcombinatorial sources of information loss are required to account for the data.

40|$|Contemporary {{transitions}} {{in the delivery}} of health and social care are a global phenomenon. They prompt a particular need to reconsider how quality in relation to professional practice should be understood and whether greater importance should be attached to values such as goodwill, altruism and commitment. Based on a qualitative study of a small voluntary sector organisation in the North of England, this paper addresses how changes in policy articulate with the identities of professionals who work in learning disability services. Drawing on MacIntyre's After Virtue, which is discussed in relation to some recent sociological debates on emotion, it is suggested that professionals have an emotionally based commitment to their work {{as well as to the}} people they work with. Professional commitment is embedded in a coherent sense of self that problematises traditional binaries between the private and the public, and the cognitive and affective. The participants in this study appeared to pursue what MacIntyre terms the 'internal goods' of practice; they valued being able to work innovatively and responsively with service users.
