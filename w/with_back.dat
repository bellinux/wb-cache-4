5|$|Although the 2012–13 team {{graduated}} five {{seniors and}} had two underclassmen (Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway, Jr.) who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA Draft from the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament national runner-up team, {{three of the five}} national runner-up team starters (Mitch McGary, Glenn Robinson III and Nik Stauskas) were returning. The entering class included a pair of state Boys Basketball Gatorade Players of the Year in Indiana Mr. Basketball Zak Irvin and Derrick Walton, runner-up Mr. Basketball of Michigan, three scholarship players and four walk-ons. The team was a top-10 preseason selection, according to the vast majority of preseason rankings, and many media outlets selected McGary as a preseason All-American. Plagued <b>with</b> <b>back</b> problems during the season, McGary played in eight of the team's first eleven games before opting for season-ending surgery.|$|E

5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured <b>with</b> <b>back</b> surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E
5|$|For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, {{it was decided that}} the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem <b>with</b> <b>back</b> lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.|$|E
5|$|Having {{struggled}} throughout 2015 <b>with</b> <b>back</b> problems, playing {{through the}} pain and medicating before matches, Dominguez sought the advice Dr. Miiller-Wohlfahrt in Munich in August. The doctor was astounded that Dominguez was still playing football as X-rays and MRI scans revealed that he had three herniated disks and further complications in his spinal canal. The full extent of Domínguez's back problems, which saw him undergo two operations, was such that during his time with Gladbach he missed 88 of the 194 games the team played {{while he was at}} the club.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Greer {{was capable}} of seating 7,200spectators, but was {{expanded}} to 8,800 {{by the end of}} the inaugural season. Theater-type seats <b>with</b> <b>back</b> support and armrests accounted for 3,000 of the stadium's seats; bleacher seats made up the remainder. The press box included two radio broadcast booths and an organ booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25people, as well as a locker room for umpires. The field measured 330feet (100m) down the left and right field lines, 375feet (114m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405feet (123m) to center field.

Eight lighting grids atop steel poles 100feet (30m) high provided illumination for night games. Amenities for customers at the park included two men's and women's restrooms and seven concession stands.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's {{positive}} relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, {{who was his}} first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined <b>with</b> <b>back</b> spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which {{kept him out of}} the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was {{in the last year of}} his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.|$|E

5|$|On 9 September 1933 Cochet turned professional, {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Tilden Tennis Tour for a guaranteed annual payment of £25.000 and joined the team of Bill Tilden and Martin Plaa. Although he was still featured on the amateur world rankings published on the 20th of the month, where he was listed one spot behind Ellsworth Vines at number six, Cochet was also on Pierre Gillou's list in fourth place, also right after Vines. Cochet made his professional debut in a Franco-American match on 22 September and defeated Bruce Barnes. Three days later he lost to Tilden in straight sets. He also made appearances at the French Riviera with Plaa <b>with</b> <b>back</b> and forth matches across France. On 10 October Tilden signed Vines to the pro tour and from then Cochet's archrival and him competed within the same league again.|$|E
5|$|On July 10, 2015, Stauskas {{was traded}} to the Philadelphia 76ers along with Carl Landry, Jason Thompson, a future first round pick, and the rights to swap first round picks in 2016 and 2017, in {{exchange}} for the rights to Artūras Gudaitis and Luka Mitrović. During the preseason, Stauskas was impaired by a right tibia stress reaction. Although he felt recovered from the stress reaction {{by the beginning of the}} season, he missed the October 28 season opener <b>with</b> <b>back</b> spasms. The 2015–16 76ers team played no players over the age of 24 or with more than 3 years of NBA experience on opening night. Stauskas joined the young team's rotation in October 30 against the Utah Jazz with a 12-point debut performance. Stauskas moved into the starting lineup on November 2 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He posted a career-high tying 15 points against his idol LeBron James. On November 7, Stauskas posted a career-high 18 points and career-high tying five assists against the Orlando Magic. He tallied at least 12 points in each of his first five games of action for Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|The success didn't last long, as Johnson {{started to}} get {{hampered}} <b>with</b> <b>back</b> injuries, which reduced his effectiveness. In 1984, Johnson had surgery for a herniated disk, an injury he suffered during training camp, and {{was known as a}} potential career-ending injury. He missed {{the first game of the}} regular season against the St. Louis Cardinals and could not fully recover from the injury. Again he lost his starting job, becoming a third-down pass-rushing specialist, and was credited with seven sacks for the year; the injury forced Johnson to mull retirement.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{was totally}} reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, {{retaining}} the existing instrument {{as far as}} was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than {{the sides of the}} case. New 75percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed <b>with</b> <b>back,</b> side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress {{from the bottom of the}} case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.|$|E
