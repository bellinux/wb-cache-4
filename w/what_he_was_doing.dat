5|$|After the {{location}} filming, production {{went back to}} soundstages for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of crane shots. With the photography done, Moore took the film to South Korea to edit to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> Visual effects were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, The Host.|$|E
5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that he knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E

The children try to persuade a seal trapper that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong, and to stop <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> Mandy finds a sick seal pup and decided {{the only way to}} save the pup is to take it through the mirror, but trouble ensues.|$|R

5|$|Morrison {{entered a}} {{classroom}} {{on the second}} floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> in the classroom, {{he pulled out his}} handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several female students to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard. He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{also saw}} Franks film scenes {{alongside}} Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, {{for the first}} time since their controversial drugs storyline in 2010. Ian told Phil about Rainie's blackmail, and Phil took Rainie to the allotments to 'deal with her'. He later told Ian that she would not be a 'problem' any longer, leaving Ian fearful of what lengths Phil had gone to. Phil was later revealed to have set Rainie up in a flat, but when his fiance Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) discovered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> she ordered him to let Rainie go as she was not his problem. As a result, he abandoned Rainie on Cora's doorstep, where Rainie promises to get clean with Cora's help. Ian's actions were revealed when Rainie, depressed after a confrontation with Mick Carter and his family, told Denise about their night together. Cora and Rainie have a heart to heart, but when Cora heads out for a short time, she returns and find Rainie gone along with her purse.|$|E

He said that Ali had talked {{him out of it}} during the {{negotiations}} {{on the grounds that they}} were cousins; but his son accused him of fearing Ali’s army. Al-Zubayr left the battle-field while Aisha continued to direct her troops. A man named Amr ibn Jurmuz decided to track his movements and followed him to a nearby field. It was time for prayer so, after each had asked the other <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> there, they agreed to pray. While Al-Zubayr was prostrating, Amr ibn Jurmuz stabbed him in the neck and killed him.|$|E

25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, never would have let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E
25|$|When {{he came to}} a {{cave and}} lodged there, God asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> there. Elijah said that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told Elijah to stand on the mount, and God passed by. A great wind rent the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces, but God was not in the wind. Then an {{earthquake}} came, but God was not in the earthquake. Then a fire came, but God was not in the fire. And then came a still small voice, which asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> there. Elijah repeated that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told him to go to Damascus and anoint Hazael to be king over Aram, to anoint Jehu to be king over Israel, and to anoint Elisha to succeed Elijah as prophet. God foretold that any who escaped the sword of Hazael would be killed by Jehu; any who escaped the sword of Jehu would be killed by Elisha; and God would leave alive in Israel only the 7 thousand who had not bowed to Baal. So Elijah found Elisha, who was plowing with one of his 12 yoke of oxen, and Elijah cast his mantle on Elisha. Elisha left the oxen, asked Elijah for permission to kiss his parents goodbye, killed the oxen and distributed their meat to the people, and went to follow Elijah.|$|E
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E
