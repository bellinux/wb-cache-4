5|$|The favored {{temperature}} {{range of the}} roughtail stingray is , {{which is the most}} important factor determining its distribution. It conducts seasonal migrations off the eastern United States: from December to May, this ray is found over the middle and outer parts of the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Florida, with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones. In the spring, the population moves north of the Cape and towards the coast into bays, inlets, and saltier estuaries, though preserving the north-south gradient of body sizes. A similar migration, from shallow coastal <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> summer to deeper offshore <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> winter, apparently occurs in the Mediterranean.
