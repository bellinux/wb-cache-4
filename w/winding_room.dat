A total of 182 people indicated experiencing byssinotic symptoms, mainly in opening and carding rooms or in spinning and <b>winding</b> <b>rooms</b> where medium to coarse cotton was being processed. This represents a significant decline in the prevalence of byssinotic symptoms over the years, due possibly to lower concentrations of airborne contaminants, especially of bacteria, as cleaner raw materials are being used.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the climate characteristics of Indonesian regions using an Olgyay Bioclimatic chart, a Givoni–Milne Bioclimatic chart and a Mahoney Table as the pre‐design stage in the development of a passive house design standard for residential house construction in Indonesia. Jakarta was the city chosen for deep analysis, because it represents most of the Indonesian regions in terms of temperature and relative humidity. The Olgyay Bioclimatic chart showed that the climate needs a high wind velocity to counteract the vapor pressure and shading in order to reduce solar gain entering the building. The Givoni–Milne Bioclimatic chart proposed natural ventilation and shading devices, while the Mahoney Table recommends open spaces for protection against hot <b>wind,</b> <b>rooms</b> single‐banked and permanent provision for air movement. The composite size of the opening at body height is better to allow the wind to counter the high levels of humidity and temperature. Heavy walls and roofs are suggested, as well as the provision of protection devices for the high amount of rainfall. Energy simulation was also done to investigate the effectiveness of the passive strategy proposed by the bioclimatic analysis.

Three visible particulate detectors were hung at each station and replaced every 3 - 4 days. The detector plates were then photographed through a microscope at 100 x magnification. Using the photomicrographs, students counted the number of visible particles, greater than ~ 100 microns, in a 1 mm x 1 mm square, and took the average of the three detector cards for each 3 - 4 day sample period. Comparing these data with the observed changes in the environment during the sampling period, we found that the parking lot had the greatest number of visible particles, dust storms greatly increased the number of visible particles, and the classroom had the fewest visible particles...|$|R

The research adopted <b>room</b> <b>wind</b> tunnel experiment, two kinds of soils were used which were from the agro-pastoral area of Inner Mongolia, the northwest of China, the clay content of soils were 22. 0 and 13. 7 %, respectively. For these tests, all the treatments were performed under the condition of wind velocity of 14 m s 1 and a blown angle of 8. 75 %, according to the actual situation of experimented area. The study results indicated that using PAM on the soil surface could enhance the capability of avoiding the wind erosion, at the same time, the effect of controlling wind soil erosion with 4 g m - 2 PAM was better than 2 g m - 2 PAM's. Economically, the 2 g m - 2 PAM used in soil surface can control wind erosion effectively in this region. The prophase PAM accumulated in soil could not improve the capability of avoiding the wind erosion, owing to the degradation of PAM in the soil and the continual tillage year after year. The texture of soil is a main factor influencing the capability of soil avoiding wind erosion. Soil with higher clay content has the higher capability of preventing soil from wind erosion than one with the opposite one under the together action of PAM and water. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

5000|$|The {{regularity}} in Östersund's {{road system}} and the slanting alleys leading from higher altitudes down towards Storsjön have created the [...] "windows to the west" [...] characteristic and unique to Östersund as a city. The alleys, often seen as rather steep, have created the illusion that the houses in the city core are climbing to higher grounds. These houses were conformed upon their construction to fit with the slopes.The first city plan of Östersund was made with several large segments in the core being reserved as green areas. Östersund was thus planned as a green city and special lots, e.g. kryddgårdstomter [...] "spice garden lots" [...] were created along with construction lots. These lots shifted with a construction lot alternating with a spice garden lot. The garden lots are no longer existent since they too have been constructed upon. Many of the fences that separated each lot from another with trees and verdure were left intact. The large green areas are still present, with parks such as Kyrkparken, Österängsparken and Badhusparken being the most prominent. Badhusparken was once {{the location of a}} large bath house (hence the name Badhus-) though it was torn down in 1881 when the railway was constructed. A new larger two-storey pompous bath house was later built on poles a few metres from the shore, enabling the population to bathe in the waters of Storsjön during summers. This house was also torn down, when a new bath house with heated water was founded in 1938.When Östersund started to grow as a city in the late 19th century the houses consisted predominantly of wood, though stone had become popular in the central parts. These houses were heavily characterized by Neo-Gothicism and Neo-Renaissance. A very common feature of these houses were towers, some even resembling those on old castles like the one on Hotell Grand at the main square. In the early 20th century a new age had come and in the main road, Prästgatan, the new age came fiercely. The wooden houses were replaced by stone buildings, because a city's well being was measured in how many stone buildings it had. At the same time military barracks were constructed in connection to the older settlement. Jugendstil became popular too as an addition to the National Romantic style architecture.In the 1930s, the functionalistic style made itself apparent in Östersund's outskirts, which were growing. In the 1940s, the city was made more car-friendly and the city was first and foremost planned for cars. Later the sanitarian issues was brought up, which resulted in the construction of a sewage treatment works and the waste water was no longer flushed directly into Storsjön. Östersund was also affected by the Million Programme, though to a lesser extent than other cities. During the same period older buildings such as Hotell Grand (to make room for Storsjöteatern), Cellfängelset (a jail located at the beginning of Prästgatan), Flickskolan (the girl school next to the city hall, where the current county library is located) and Västra stationen (at Badhusparken) were torn down. The local media described it all as e.g. [...] "demolishing madness". When the Good Templar house was threatened in order to widen Rådhusgatan the city's inhabitants had had enough and the building was saved.The buildings along Storgatan (literally: [...] "the great road") with entire segments intact since the 1880s are considered one of the best preserved city settlements in Sweden.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P BSE 2015 Lauxix, 157 leaves, 97 {{variously}} numbered pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmLocal code {{of practice}} for fire safety in buildings issued by Buildings Department (BD) requires supertall buildings over forty storeys high to provide a refuge floor for every 25 storeys in residential/commercial buildings. However, the protection to external wall openings on refuge floor by a drencher/water curtain system falls within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Fire Services Department (FSD). There is a concern on the trend for flatted units in supertall buildings to have large window/glass panes design so as to have more sunlight and a better view. The result is that this design increases the impact of the ventilation factor, which in turn steps up the heat release rate for flashover and fire development in compartment fires. Another concern is the external wall opening sizes on the refuge floor vary greatly in different types of buildings. The differeence in the ratio of the area of an external wall opening to the area of the external wall of the refuge floor greatly affects the effectiveness of cross-ventilation on that floor. For a better understanding, a survey of building plans including 44 building lots (51 blocks) of residential and non-residential buildings was conducted. As statistics from FSD reveal that about 80 % of structural fires occurred in government housing estates and private residential buildings, my study focuses on these types of buildings. Detailed inspections of building plans of 29 building lots (31 blocks) were conducted to obtain and analyze, for each of the building, the ratio of the area of an external wall opening to the area of the external wall on the refuge floor, the ratio of the window opening area to the external wall area as well as the ratio of the window opening area to the floor area of the flatted unit immediately below the refuge floor. The trend of refuge floor designs and the cross-ventilation requirement stipulated in the relevant local building code were also analysed. To determine the minimum amount of heat released for flashover in a compartment with large window panes, 31 supertall residential buildings were selected and the Babrauskas method for flashover was adopted. The results showed that the average minimum heat release rate for flashover was 15. 3 MW for an unit having an average window opening area of 15. 1 m². To evaluate the effectiveness of a water curtain system in achieving heat reduction, radiation attenuation and smoke reduction from entering the refuge floor, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was adopted. Before working on the CFD model, a pre-study in four main subject areas was conducted: (1) comparing the simulation results of the FDS model with another CFD model called "SIMTEC" and also with the results of full-scale burning test from literature; (2) selecting appropriate fuel types as an input parameter in FDS simulation; (3) comparing the performance of the sprinkler system and the water curtain system; and (4) making FDS trial runs covering different locations of fire seat, domain model geometry and fire sizes, etc. Simulation results from my pre-study showed that the results generated by the FDS model were comparatively more conservative in subject area 1 (i. e. lower temperture reduction and lower radiation attenuation) and agreed well with burning test results from literature (at least in the veocity of outflow gases) and with temeprature profile of the fire plume. In the selection of the appropriate fuel type for FDS simulation study, my prime objective was to look for the adverse effects in the combustion of propane, wood, polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Simulation results including outputs of temperature, visibilities, carbon monoxide concentrations and radiation heat fluxes from different scenarios were evaluated. The highly hazardous properties of burning PVC and PU in producing large amounts of carbon monoxide and very low visibilities within {{a short period of time}} were carefully considered. The sprinkler system is commonly used in fire protection but this is not the case in the protection of external wall openings on the refuge floor. To compare the performance of the sprinkler system with that of the water curtain system in defined scenarios, the FDS model was adopted. Simulation results showed that the water curtain system performed better in of temeprature reduction and radiation atttenuation. To simulate the performance of the water curtain system on refuge floor external wall openings, a two-storey building model consisting of a fire room measuring 11 m (length) x 9 m (width) x 3 m (height) on the ground floor with a refuge floor immediately above it was designed. A fire was assumed to be spreading from the fire room after a flashover fire with flames ejecting through broken windows and spreading upwards along the external wall and wall openings of the refuge floor. An in-depth simulation study using FDS in different scenarios and design parameters including different fire sizes, opening widths of the fire <b>room,</b> <b>wind</b> speeds and scenarios with and without the water curtain system were conducted. The results showed that the water curtain sytem performed well in temeperature reduction, radiation attenuation and visibility enhancement on the refuge floor. Attenuation of thermal radiation by the drencher/water curtain system and relevant parameters such as water flow rates, water pressures, spacing of drencher nozzles, water droplet sizes and water density were studied using FDS simulation. Theories of Beer-Lambert's law and its analogy were adopted and simulation data analysed. The relationship between the parameters and the ratios of radiation intensity for scenarios with and without water curtain protection was established. A generalized equation to calculate the maximum attenuation of thermal radiation by a water curtain system was formulated using multiple regression analysis. The introduction of a building fire safety management system to monitor building fire safety based on the total fire safety concept together with an ultimate building fire safety audit system to ensure overall building fire safety has been developed. Methods and procedures in the evaluation of building fire safety levels are also presented. The thesis concludes that in the scenarios studied, the water curtain system performs well in temperature reduction, radiation attenuation and visibility enhancement on the refuge floor; and offers recommendations on how to improve the design of the water curtain system. Limitations of the study and suggestions on further work on the adequacy of ventilation requirement on the refuge floor are also given. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.
