25|$|The 1960 Agadir {{earthquake}} occurred 29 February at 23:40 Western European Time (UTC+00:00). Agadir {{is located}} in western Morocco {{on the shore of}} the Atlantic Ocean. Despite the earthquake's moderate magnitude of 5.7, its maximum perceived intensity was X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Between 12,000 and 15,000 people (about a third of the city's population of the time) were killed and another 12,000 injured with at least 35,000 people left homeless, making it the most destructive and deadliest earthquake in Moroccan history. Particularly hard hit was the Talbordjt area. The earthquake's shallow focus, close proximity to the port city of Agadir, and unsatisfactory construction methods were all reasons declared by earthquake engineers and seismologists as to <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> destructive.|$|E

I didn't know <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E

500|$|Contemporaneous critics praised Terhune's writing {{style and}} the overall story appeal, while dog breeders criticized his {{unrealistic}} canine characters. In retrospective reviews, critics considered that the novel had aged badly, and that Terhune displayed little actual writing skill, but noted that the novel was able to hold long-lasting appeal as it triggered the reader's desire to have such an ideal dog. Terhune himself considered the novel [...] "hack writing" [...] and did not understand <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> popular. Because of its reception, {{he went on to}} publish two additional novels featuring Lad and one featuring Lad's son, Wolf, as well as many other fictional stories featuring dogs. Warner Brothers released a film adaptation in June 1962. A series of four children's picture books based on three of the stories from the novel were published by Margo Lundell between 1997 and 1998.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{inspired}} to create an album where [...] "every song was a killer" [...] and developed Thriller with that in mind. Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album. Jones discussed [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> personal to Jackson, who struggled {{to deal with a}} number of obsessed fans. Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened; however, Jackson insisted that it remain because it made him want to dance. The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy Off the Wall. Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song [...] "Beat It". Eventually, they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm-guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo.|$|E
500|$|At this time, {{physicists}} were {{puzzled by}} beta decay, {{in which an}} electron was emitted from the atomic nucleus. To satisfy the law of conservation of energy, Pauli postulated {{the existence of an}} invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. Fermi took up this idea, which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi called a [...] "neutrino". His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction, described one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The neutrino was detected after his death, and his interaction theory showed <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> difficult to detect. When he submitted his paper to the British journal Nature, that journal's editor turned it down because it contained speculations which were [...] "too remote from physical reality to be of interest to readers". Thus Fermi saw the theory published in Italian and German before it was published in English.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{whether his}} {{character}} could ever find [...] "The One", John Barrowman asserts that Jack [...] "likes everybody, {{and his love}} for each person is different". Barrowman believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but [...] "would never take that beyond infatuation" [...] and [...] "would never let the Doctor know". Barrowman claims that Jack also [...] "" [...] fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her [...] "tenacity" [...] and willingness to [...] "spat with him", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as [...] "fatherly", stating [...] "He was guiding them. That's <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> devastating for him to lose them." [...] The second series of Torchwood also introduced Jack's ex-lover, Captain John. Head writer Chris Chibnall introduced John {{to act as a}} [...] "proper nemesis, somebody to really test , to push him, and to reveal something about Jack's character". In the use of Captain John as a literary foil, Chibnall comments [...] "you see the way Jack could have gone, and probably did, for a little while" [...] which underlines how [...] "Jack, in his experiences with the Doctor and Torchwood, made a very conscious decision to move away from that behaviour." ...|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E

However, like many dishes, there are connections to the French Huguenots who were forced out of France in the late 17th century, but eventually returned from the various countries to which they had fled.

2500|$|The Rev.

[...] Chapman initially embraced his old religion with new fervor as a result; but after McGowan revealed information to the press that Chapman had told him in confidence, Chapman disavowed his renewed interest in Christianity and reverted to his initial explanation: that he had killed Lennon to promote the reading of The Catcher in the Rye.

2500|$|Calvary as an English {{name for}} the place {{is derived from the}} Latin word for skull (calvaria), which is used in the Vulgate {{translation}} of [...] "place of a skull", the explanation given in all four Gospels of the Aramaic word Gûlgaltâ which {{was the name of the}} place where Jesus was crucified. The text does not indicate <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> designated, but several theories have been put forward. One is that as a place of public execution, Calvary may have been strewn with the skulls of abandoned victims (which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions, but not Roman). Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery (which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites). A third is that the name was derived from the physical contour, which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word, i.e., the place of [...] "a skull". While often referred to as [...] "Mount Calvary", it was more likely a small hill or rocky knoll.|$|E

The album's lead single [...] "Schoolgirl" [...] flopped in Europe and Australia, but Wilde's {{fortunes}} improved in spectacular fashion with the album's second single, a Hi-NRG remake of The Supremes classic [...] "You Keep Me Hangin' On". After topping the charts in Australia and Canada and peaking at number two in the UK, it became a US number one single in 1987. With that hit, she became the fifth UK female solo artist ever to top the US Hot 100, following Petula Clark, Lulu, Sheena Easton, and Bonnie Tyler.
