40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{mountain}} pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), {{is the most}} destructive bark beetle in western North America. Dendroctonus ponderosae can be prevented from successfully colonizing and killing individual trees by ground-based sprays of insecticides applied directly to the tree bole. However, the future availability of several active ingredients, including carbarylwhich is most commonly used in thewestern United States, is uncertain. Two novel insecticides, cyantraniliprole [Cyazypyr ™-OD (oil dispersion) and Cyazypyr ™-SC (suspension concentrate) ] and chlorantraniliprole (Rynaxypyr ®), and carbaryl were assayed in both filter paper and topical assays. RESULTS: Compared with 20 000 mg L− 1 carbaryl (i. e. the maximum label rate for solutions applied to conifers for protection from bark beetle attack in the western United States), cyantraniliprole OD caused similar rates of mortality in D. ponderosae adults at 400 -fold <b>weaker</b> <b>concentrations</b> in both bioassays, while cyantraniliprole SC caused similar rates of mortality at 40 -fold <b>weaker</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Probit analyses confirmed that D. ponderosae is most sensitive to cyantraniliprole OD, while chlorantraniliprole was effective at concentrations similar to carbaryl. CONCLUSIONS: Theseresults suggest that lower concentrations of carbaryl have merit for field testing than have been previously considered. While cyantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole have similar modes of action, cyantraniliprole OD appears to have greater promise for protecting individual trees from mortality attributed to D. ponderosae attack and should be evaluated in field studies...|$|R

40|$|A cytochemical {{study of}} the nucleus of Sarcoma 180 cancer cells from Crocker albino mice, grown ^n vitro, was made. The {{cancerous}} cells were treated with various reagents {{in an attempt to}} elucidate the nature of the nucleus. The Feulgen nuclear reaction revealed the presence of large quantities of DKA (deoxyribonucleic acid) within the nucleus of these malignant cells, which was not only evenly distributed throughout the structure, but also concentrated near one end of the nuclear membrane in some cells. Cells were treated with 0. 2 % and 1. 0 % DNAase (adjusted to a pH of 6. 0) and incubated at 37 ° C. for a one hour period. Treatment with the enzyme caused rapid breakdown of nuclear material leaving an apparently empty structure except for the presence of very conspicuous nucleoli. The enzyme revealed an apparent thickened nuclear membrane. The thickening was probably a result of the penetration of the membrane by the enzyme, or due to a breakdown of the chromatin material that has long been established as being in association with the nuclear membrane. Some of the cultures were treated with varying concentrations of a soap-like detergent, digitonin. When cells were treated with strong concentrations of the substance (0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, and 5. 0 %) and incubated for a 12 hr. period, both the nuclei and cytoplasm became solubilized. Whereas, when <b>weak</b> <b>concentrations</b> (0. 1 % and 0. 2 %) were utilized, only the cytoplasm was solubilized leaving the nuclei intact.
