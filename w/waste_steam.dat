Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its <b>waste</b> <b>steam</b> generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

Today, there is an enormous amount of <b>waste</b> <b>steam</b> and waste heat with temperatures between 100 and 150°C generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the Organic Rankine Cycle. In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below 100°C. Such systems are however fairly complex. They work with pressures of 6 to 20 bars, so that the whole system has to be completely sealed.|$|E

To reduce the cost of feed on the sheep farm need to find of alternative feed. Cassava waste is agricultural waste that still has the contents of protein and carbohydrates and is still limit ed in their use, so it needs to feed processing technology. The purpose of this study to determine the influence of cassava <b>waste</b> <b>steamed</b> and supplementation MHA i n the ration to performance of local male sheep. This research held for 12 weeks starting on 11 th August – 2 nd November 2009 in a mini -farm Department of Animal Hu sbandry, Faculty of Agriculture, Sebelas Maret University located at the Jatikuwung village, Gondangrejo, Karanganyar District. Research materials include 12 male sheeps with an average weight 10, 44 ± 0, 875 kg. Experimental design used was Complete ly Randomized Design (CRD) with one way classification consists of three treatments and four replications, which each replication using a local male sheep. The feed used was forage, cassava was te and MHA with forage and cassava waste ratio 60 : 40. Treatment will include P 0 (king grass + without cassava <b>waste</b> <b>steamed),</b> P 1 (king grass + cassava <b>waste</b> <b>steamed)</b> and P 2 (king grass + cassava <b>waste</b> <b>steamed</b> +MHA). Observed variables included feed consump tion (DM), protein consumption, average daily gain, feed conve rsion, protein efficiency ration and feed cost per gain. The results showed that the average of three treatments at P 0, P 1 and P 2 for feed consumption (DM) was 1007, 52; 1170, 30; 1144, 90 (g/head/ day). Protein consumption was 144, 57; 167, 93; 158, 91 (g/head/day). Average daily gain was 50, 51; 57, 65 and 54, 59 (g/head/day). Feed conversion was 20, 47; 20, 51 and 21, 18. Protein efficiency ration was 0, 351; 0, 344; 0, 344 while the feed cost per gain was Rp. 15. 303. 29; Rp. 15, 425. 19; Rp. 1 6, 080. 27. Analysis of variance showed significantly different results for feed and protein consumption (P > 0. 05), and no significant different to the efficiency of protein ration and feed conversion, whereas covariance analysis showed no significant different results on the average daily gain (P< 0. 05). Conclusions can be taken in this study was cassava <b>waste</b> <b>steamed</b> and supplementation MHA i n the ration did not increase average daily gain and decrease of feed conversion, but increased feed consumption, protein consumption and demonstrate the efficiency of low-protein rations, as well as providing a feed cost per gain rate economical in steaming treatment without MHA supplementation.
