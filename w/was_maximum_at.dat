Uterine and pituitary weights varied significantly; uterine weight <b>was</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>at</b> pro-oestrus and pituitary weight <b>was</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>at</b> oestrus. The cyclic changes in the vaginal smear cells were correlated with the cyclic ovarian changes; the morning of di-oestrus I (2 mornings after newly ovulated ova are found in the oviduct) was the most useful marker for cycle stage, since it could always be recognized as the 1 st morning on which only leucocytes and nucleated epithelial cells (no cornified cells) were present in the vaginal smear. In additional studies, females, which had been previously grouped (ten/cage), were paired individually with males and killed on days of 'induced ' pro-oestrus (pre-ovulatory) or oestrus (post-ovulatory).

40|$|Abstract—Transition {{theory has}} been used to derive the elasticplastic and {{transitional}} stresses. Results obtained have been discussed numerically and depicted graphically. It is observed that the rotating disk made of incompressible material with inclusion require higher angular speed to yield at the internal surface as compared to disk made of compressible material. It is seen that the radial and circumferential stresses <b>are</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>at</b> the internal surface with and without edge load (for flat disk). With the increase in thickness parameter (k = 2, 4), the circumferential stress <b>is</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>at</b> the external surface while the radial stress <b>is</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>at</b> the internal surface. From the figures drawn the disk with exponentially varying thickness (k = 2), high angular speed is required for initial yielding at internal surface as compared to flat disk and exponentially varying thickness for k = 4 onwards. It is concluded that the disk made of isotropic compressible material is on the safer side of the design as compared to disk made of isotropic incompressible material as it requires higher percentage increase in an angular speed to become fully plastic from its initial yielding...|$|R
