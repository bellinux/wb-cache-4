5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants.

Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use.
