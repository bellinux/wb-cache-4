25|$|Jewish {{settlement}} in the Livingston Manor area began in 1882 when what was then known as the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad built a depot there. Local farmers could ship their produce to New York City. Some German Jews who had emigrated to the United States {{found their way to}} the Catskills and developed dairy farms. The railroad provided access to the region for city residents who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the summer heat, leading some farmers and residents to get into the resort and summer camp business. Many resort facilities discriminated against Jews, refusing them as guests.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew {{that the only way to}} get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

500|$|With {{over twenty}} years of {{parliamentary}} majorities, Liberal ministers did as they wished {{with little regard for}} the opposition parties. The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state, a development initially opposed by many Tories. C.D. Howe, considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government, told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them, [...] "Who would stop us?...

500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a government surplus. In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us?

500|$|Within the Labour Party, Livingstone {{was aligned}} with the hard left. Historian Alwyn W.

[...] Biographer John Carvel, a journalist from The Guardian, remarked that Livingstone's political motivation was a [...] "fundamental desire... for a more participative, cooperative society", leading him to oppose [...] "concentrations of power and... exploitation {{in all its forms}} – economic, racial and sexual." [...] However, Livingstone has also described his approach to fiscal policy as [...] "monetarist": [...] "I was a monetarist right from the beginning when I was leader of the GLC. We paid down debt every year. We had an absolutely firm rule." ...|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman {{rendered}} the original three-page [...] "Maus" [...] and [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] in highly detailed, expressive styles. [...] Spiegelman planned to draw Maus {{in such a}} manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. [...] Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. [...] Spiegelman <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the rendering {{of the characters in}} the original [...] "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, [...] "tells you how to feel, tells you how to think". [...] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. [...] He drew the cat-Nazis {{the same size as the}} mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions. [...] The contrast between the artwork in [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork—"Prisoner" [...] is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.|$|E
500|$|By {{at least}} July 1999, Monolith {{has decided to}} {{introduce}} many major changes to the game; the main reason being that the gaming press unexpectedly started comparing the game to James Bond games, like GoldenEye 007 (1997). Hubbard mentioned that their intention was to [...] "make a 60s spy game", and that they [...] "didn't {{want to make a}} 'Bond' style game, so when people were obviously drawing that comparison, we decided to rework things a bit. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the Bond comparisons that people were making, so we've changed the main character and the back-story a fair amount." [...] As a result, the player controls a female protagonist in the final game, Cate Archer, who works for an organization called UNITY. Changing the main character to a woman not only helped the separation of the game from the Bond franchise, but also allowed for [...] "more interesting dramatic possibilities", and the [...] "list of gadgets got a lot more visually interesting". As Hubbard said, before switching to a female protagonist, he had been [...] "struggling with trying to distinguish him from all the other male superspies from the era—extraordinarily handsome, intelligent, knowledgeable, resourceful, and so on. But a woman with those same characteristics immediately stood out because of the social climate of the time. No matter how qualified she might be, she'd have to overcome some serious barriers just {{to get a chance to}} prove herself. And if things didn't go flawlessly on a mission, she'd catch more heat than she deserved." ...|$|E

2500|$|In effect, Verdi {{is taking}} control over {{all aspects of}} the piece, which {{includes}} the condensation of the sprawling play into his four acts. (The first three acts of Hugo's play become act 1 of the opera). Rather than allow the librettist a free hand in composing his verses, [...] "this would have perpetuated in a diminished form the word-music division that Verdi precisely <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from. The composer's desire to take charge of every aspect of an opera implied that he had the power to decide what weight to give the text and the music, respectively, depending upon the [...] "moment" [...] of the action.|$|E
2500|$|Back in high school, Gilbert {{never looked}} at big-time {{football}} factories such as Michigan. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from what he saw in Detroit.

So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan {{to go to a}} school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas.

2500|$|A {{few days}} later Tito arrived and Maclean had to convey Churchill's displeasure at his sudden and unexplained departure. [...] Tito had been to Moscow at Stalin's invitation, to arrange matters with the Soviet High Command. [...] Maclean helped to hammer out a draft agreement, and went to London with it, while Tito's envoys took it to Moscow. [...] "It was a {{difficult}} and thankless task. King Peter, quite naturally, {{was not easy to}} reassure, and Tito, sitting in Belgrade with all the cards in his hand, was not easy to satisfy." [...] The bargaining went on for months, and meanwhile Maclean's staff <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> to assist guerrilla wars elsewhere. [...] When the Big Three (Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin) met at Yalta in February 1945, and made it clear that Tito and Šubašić had to get on with it, King Peter gave in, and all the pieces fell into place. The regents were sworn in, as was the united government, and the British ambassador flew in. [...] Maclean was finally able to leave.|$|E

2500|$|Banville {{was educated}} at CBS Primary, Wexford, a Christian Brothers school, and at St Peter's College, Wexford. Despite having {{intended}} to be a painter and an architect, he did not attend university. Banville has described this as [...] "A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from my family. I wanted to be free." [...] Alternately he has stated that college would have had little benefit for him: [...] "I don't think I would have learned much more, and I don't think I would have had the nerve to tackle some of the things I tackled as a young writer if I had been to university — I would have been beaten into submission by my lecturers." [...] After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus, which allowed him to travel at deeply discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland, he became a sub-editor at The Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of Iberian sculpture {{became an issue}} in 1939, when Alfred Barr claimed that the primitivism of the Demoiselles derived from the art of Côte d'Ivoire and the French Congo.

Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero with Andre Malraux in June 1907, about which he later said [...] "When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. The flea market, the smell. I was all alone. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was happening to me, right. The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things." [...] Maurice de Vlaminck is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of Fang extraction in 1904.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{classification}} {{system for the}} sport was developed in Scandinavia and was a medical system for skiers with amputations. [...] At the time, other types of disability were not eligible for classification. [...] In developing a system for use at the first Winter Paralympics, organisers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from a medical {{classification system}} and use a functional system, but they {{ended up with a}} system based on equipment utilised by the skier instead. [...] As the 1970s progressed, equipment improvements made it possible for skiers with spinal cord injuries to participate and a classification system developed for these skiers. [...] By the 1990s, there were over ten Nordic skiing classes and a percentage system was developed to allow skiers with different disabilities inside one of three groups to compete against each other. [...] The skiers time {{at the end of the}} race would be multiplied against a percentage to determine a time that allowed for fair cross classification comparisons. [...] While the actual percentages change from time to time, this system to calculate a winner is still in use. [...] Despite repeated efforts to move to a true functional mobility based classification dating back to the 1970s, medical assessment still took place during the classification process in the 2010s.|$|E
