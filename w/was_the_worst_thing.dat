25|$|During the 1980s, {{crime rates}} in New York City were peaking after rising since 1966. Between 1966 and 1981, violent crime {{rates in the}} city had more than tripled from 325 to 1100 violent crimes per 100,000 people annually. By mid-decade, the city had a {{reported}} crime rate over 70% higher {{than the rest of}} the United States. In 1984, there were 2 homicides, 18 violent crimes, and 65 property thefts reported per 10,000 people. The subway became a symbol of the city's inability to control crime. In an opinion poll of New York City residents taken the month after the shootings, more than half of those surveyed said crime <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> about living in the city; about a quarter said they or a family member had been a victim of crime in the last year; and two-thirds said they would be willing to pay for private security for their building or block.|$|E
500|$|In the lead-up to the match, Ferguson criticised Arsenal's {{previous}} conduct at Old Trafford and likened their behaviour {{to that of}} a mob: [...] "What Arsenal players {{did that}} day <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> I've seen in this sport. No wonder they were so delighted at the verdicts." [...] He described the game as must win given Arsenal's points advantage, but highlighted it was still all to play for given the league leaders needed to play several top teams twice. Although Ferguson praised Arsenal's unbeaten run, he disputed whether this heralded a shift of power in English football: [...] " [...] are still the team every club wants to beat most of all – regardless of who is champions or unbeaten records. In that respect, our profile as the major club in the country is untouchable. That is obvious and will never change." ...|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> possible. And {{not because it is}} a bad government. Really, it is not a bad government. It is a good one--and they know it--much better than they would make for themselves, probably. But for that reason it is so very bad." ...|$|R
500|$|Geoff Ryman wrote several award-winning {{novels and}} short stories that {{prominently}} feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of The Child Garden (1989), an outsider {{because of her}} resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into {{a relationship with a}} similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. Lust (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. Was (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally-challenged abused child, linked by their connection to The Wizard of Oz books and film. In a Locus magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible: “In 1990, if you had asked me which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I'd have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then Was came out.... They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn't say SF — at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sources are}} {{inconsistent}} regarding {{the extent of}} the persecution in Constantius's domain, though all portray it as quite limited. Lactantius states that the destruction of church buildings <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that came to pass. Eusebius explicitly denies that any churches were destroyed in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Life of Constantine, but lists Gaul as an area suffering from the effects of the persecution in his Martyrs of Palestine. A group of bishops declared that [...] "Gaul was immune" [...] (immunis est Gallia) from the persecutions under Constantius. The death of Saint Alban, the first British Christian martyr, was once dated to this era, but most now assign it to the reign of Septimius Severus. The second, third and fourth edicts seem not to have been enforced in the West at all. It is possible that Constantius's relatively tolerant policies were the result of Tetrarchic jealousies; the persecution, after all, had been the project of the Eastern emperors, not the Western ones. After Constantine succeeded his father in 306, he urged the recovery of Church property lost in the persecution, and legislated full freedom for all Christians in his domain.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the public}} controversy, on October 18, 2007, the Board of Trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory {{suspended}} Watson's administrative responsibilities. On October 19, Watson issued an apology; on October 25, he resigned from his position as chancellor. In 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. As of 2009, he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a 2008 BBC documentary, Watson said: [...] "I have never {{thought of myself as}} a racist. I don't see myself as a racist. I am mortified by it. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> in my life." [...] An editorial in Nature at the time acknowledged that his remarks were [...] "beyond the pale," [...] but wished that the tour had not been cancelled so that Watson would be forced to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter.|$|E
2500|$|The Ninth Doctor {{intentionally}} electrocuted the Dalek {{he encountered}} in [...] "Dalek" [...] despite its pleas {{for him to}} have pity, coldly stating [...] "you never did". The Tenth Doctor notably had a [...] "one chance only" [...] policy when dealing with aliens invading the Earth, leading to his companion Donna Noble commenting that he needs [...] "someone" [...] to keep his temperament in check. In [...] "The Family of Blood", the Doctor defeats an alien who noted retrospectively that [...] "he never raised his voice – that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing,</b> the fury of a Time Lord". The Eleventh Doctor was the only Doctor to undergo three significant personality changes: becoming even more ruthless when alone in his travels, when Amy Pond and Rory Williams were absent; falling into a depression beyond his other incarnations when the couple were lost to him, becoming the first Doctor to retire voluntarily; and finally being overjoyed at the prospect that Clara Oswin Oswald was alive.|$|E
2500|$|When Sondheim {{was about}} ten years old (around {{the time of his}} parents' divorce), he became friends with James Hammerstein, son of lyricist and playwright Oscar Hammerstein II. The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's {{surrogate}} father, influencing him profoundly and developing his love of musical theatre. Sondheim met Hal Prince, who would direct many of his shows, at the opening of South Pacific, Hammerstein's musical with Richard Rodgers. The comic musical he wrote at George School, By George, was a success among his peers and buoyed the young songwriter's self-esteem. When Sondheim asked Hammerstein to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author, he said it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> he had ever seen: [...] "But {{if you want to know}} why it's terrible, I'll tell you." [...] They spent the rest of the day going over the musical, and Sondheim later said, [...] "In that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bright {{became friends}} with Tim DuBois, head of Arista Records in Nashville, who {{was not only a}} label {{executive}} but a creative-type person whom Bright naturally related to as a fellow [...] "song junkie". The two enjoyed playing songs for each other and analyzing them critically, leading DuBois to recognize Bright's keen insight into what makes a commercially good song. DuBois had under contract three musicians whom he suggested work together rather than go for separate careers. The new trio was named [...] "BlackHawk" [...] and consisted of Henry Paul, Dave Robbins, and Van Stephenson. They had recorded several songs, but DuBois was not happy with their sound and he asked Bright to spend time with them {{to come up with something}} with more commercial appeal. Bright collaborated with the band on intensive rehearsal sessions in a basement studio over several months, coming up with a bluegrass-type sound but with rock guitars, blending a mandolin and close vocal harmonies. Bright thought the sound was a [...] "game changer". DuBois agreed and was willing to give Bright his first job as producer. Bright's production of BlackHawk's first single, [...] "Goodbye Says It All" [...] was released in 1993 and reached number 11 on the Billboard Country charts. Their next four songs were even more successful, all reaching the top ten. BlackHawk eventually sold over four million albums. Over a 12 year span Bright had ascended from the tape room to Vice President of EMI Publishing. With this extraordinary success, Bright said, [...] "I thought I was king of the world". His success did not last. The next four acts he produced were failures and he was subsequently terminated by EMI. Bright stated [...] "God kicked me back down the ladder[...] [...] it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> in my life at that time." [...] Later, EMI's then competitor, Sony/ATV approached Bright with a joint venture giving him his own publishing company, a production deal, and seed money for a management deal. He accepted, and with associate Marty Williams, co-founded the publishing company Teracel Music.|$|E
