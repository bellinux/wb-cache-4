60|$|First as to Health. One of {{the first}} duties of a citizen is to keep himself in mental and bodily health {{in order to be}} fit {{for the rest of his}} duties. Now the real Bible, our model, is {{extremely}} explicit upon a number of points, upon what constitutes cleanness or uncleanness, upon ablutions, upon what a man or woman may eat and what may not be eaten, upon a number of such points. It was for its times and circumstances a directory of healthy practice. Well, I do not see why the Bible of a Modern Civilization should not contain a book of similarly clear injunctions and warnings--why <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>tell</b> every one of our people what is to be known about self-care.|$|R

60|$|We follow John {{upstairs to}} the General's apartments, and enter with Mr. George Esmond Warrington, who makes a prodigious fine bow. There is only one lady in the room, seated near a window: there is not often much {{sunshine}} in Dean Street: the young lady in the window is no especial beauty: but it is spring-time, and she is blooming vernally. A bunch of fresh roses is flushing in her honest cheek. I suppose her eyes are violets. If we lived a hundred years ago, and wrote in the Gentleman's or the London Magazine, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> Mr. Sylvanus Urban that her neck was the lily, and her shape the nymph's: we should write an acrostic about her, and celebrate our Lambertella in an elegant poem, still to be read between a neat new engraved plan {{of the city of}} Prague and the King of Prussia's camp, and a map of Maryland and the Delaware counties.|$|E
60|$|But Vane {{never left}} my elbow. Suspecting, I suppose, {{he gave me}} clearly to {{understand}} that if I did so, I must expect no mercy from him. My story, denounced by him as an outrageous lie, would {{be regarded as the}} funk-inspired subterfuge of a young rogue. At the best I should handicap myself with suspicion that would last me throughout my career. On the other hand, what harm had we done? Presented in some twenty or so small towns, where it would soon be forgotten, a play something like. Most plays were something like. Our friend would produce his version and reap a rich harvest; ours would disappear. If by any unlikely chance discussion should arise, the advertisement would be to his advantage. So soon as possible we would replace it by a new piece altogether. A young man of my genius could surely write something better than hotch-potch such as this; experience was all that I had lacked. As regarded one's own conscience, was not the world's honesty a mere question of convention? Had he been a young man, and had we diddled him out of his play for a ten-pound note, we should have been applauded as sharp men of business. The one commandment of the world was: Don't get found out. The whole trouble, left alone, would sink and fade. Later, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> it as a good joke--and be laughed with.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have a bad}} {{prospect}} before us," [...] Julian went on. [...] "There is {{no denying}} that; but it will {{make all the difference}} how we face it. Above all things we have got to keep up our spirits. I have heard that the captains of the whalers in the northern seas do everything in their power to interest and amuse their crews. They sing, they dance, they tell stories of adventures, and the great thing is to keep from brooding over the present. I am but a young sergeant, and most of you here have gone through many a campaign, and it is not for me to give advice, but I should say that above all things we ought to try to keep up the spirits of our men. If we could but start the marching songs we used to sing as we tramped through Germany, it would set men's feet going in time, would make them forget the cold and hunger, and they would march along erect, instead of with their eyes fixed on the ground, and stumbling as if they could not drag their feet along. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>tell</b> them why we sing, or they might think it was a mockery. Tell them that the Grenadiers of the Rhone mean to show that, come what may, they intend to be soldiers to the last, and to face death, whether from the Russians or from the winter, heads erect and courage high. Let us show them that, as we have ever done our duty, so we shall do it to the end, and {{that it will be a}} matter of pride that throughout the division it should be said, when they hear our songs, 'There go the Grenadiers of the Rhone, brave fellows and good comrades; see how they bear themselves.'" ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{interest}} in argumentation is provoked {{at least in}} part by the apparent paradox it presents. People are arguing because they disagree, sometimes deeply. But despite their disagreement, their transaction is orderly—at least, somewhat orderly. Furthermore, this orderliness apparently has a normative element; it establishes grounds for participants to critique each other's conduct as good and bad. How is this normative orderliness achieved, {{even in the face of}} disagreement?—That must be a central question for any theory, especially one that aims to deepen our understanding of the normative pragmatics of arguing (van Eemeren, 1994; Jacobs, 1999; Goodwin, 2002, 2007). In this essay, I want to probe one rather abstract aspect of this question, about what I will call the general "shape " of the account <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be giving of argumentative orderliness. In attempting to understand or explain argumentative talk, how <b>should</b> <b>we</b> represent the activity? What basic model <b>should</b> <b>we</b> be using? In what terms <b>should</b> <b>we</b> explain the affairs? What story <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> about them? Or, again, to put this generally, what shape should an account of arguing take? One common approach to this question has been to say that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> account for arguin...|$|R

He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct his wife; he will then be able to tell her that there is not only a God, and that He is the just rewarder of good and evil, but that He is a merciful Being, and with infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears to punish those that offend; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should return and live; and even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution; that it is a clear evidence of God and of a future state that righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till they come into another world; and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of the last judgment.

40|$|Personal {{jurisdiction}} is a mess, {{and only}} Congress can fix it. The field is a morass, filled with buzzwords of nebulous origin and application. Courts have sought a single doctrine that simultaneously guarantees convenience for plaintiffs, fairness for defendants, and legitimate {{authority for the}} tribunal. Caught between these goals, we 2 ̆ 7 ve let each new fact pattern pull precedent in a different direction, robbing litigants of certainty and blunting the force of our substantive law. Solving the problem starts with reframing it. Rather than ask where a case may be heard, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ask who may hear it. If the parties are from the same state, that state 2 ̆ 7 s courts are open. If not, the federal courts are. But while most hard jurisdictional problems involve states, the federal courts still follow state jurisdictional rules. This is a mistake, and also something we can change. Following the McIntyre plurality 2 ̆ 7 s invitation, this Article suggests a system of nationwide federal personal jurisdiction, erasing the state lines that separate federal courts. In a federal forum, the court’s authority is usually clear and its location largely irrelevant [...] letting us address the parties 2 ̆ 7 convenience through well-crafted venue rules, backstopped by due process guarantees of fundamental fairness. The Article goes on to develop draft legislative language addressing the new system 2 ̆ 7 s consequences for venue, choice of law, appeal rights, and so on. The goal isn 2 ̆ 7 t to defend one specific proposal, but to encourage new proposals and, eventually, to change {{the direction of the}} debate.

All too often, the political and institutional dimensions of knowledge production are lost beneath the intellectual debates. This book redresses the balance. Written in a narrative style and drawing on archival sources and oral histories, it depicts the complex pattern of personal and administrative relationships that shape scholarly worlds. Focusing {{on the field of}} social anthropology in twentieth-century Britain, this book describes individual, departmental and institutional rivalries over funding and influence. It examines the efforts of scholars such as Bronislaw Malinowski, Edward Evans-Pritchard and Max Gluckman to further their own visions for social anthropology. Did the future lie with the humanities or the social sciences, with addressing social problems or developing scholarly autonomy? This new history situates the disciplines rise within the post-war expansion of British universities and the challenges created by the end of Empire...|$|R
