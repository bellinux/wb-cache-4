5|$|Aside {{from the}} team sport of football, which had 16 participants, fencing and wrestling were the sports in which Egypt had the most participants, sending 12 representatives to each. Of them, wrestling was almost {{exclusively}} male with only one female, Rabab Eid, taking part. The sport with the most Egyptian female participation was synchronized swimming, an all-woman tournament at the Olympics, with eight, while the nation sent six women to fencing, the highest amount for a mixed sport. Among tournaments <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> {{both men and women}} to take part, Egypt qualified females, but not males, for badminton, and males, but not females, for track and field athletics, boxing, canoeing, equestrian, football, judo, and sailing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the threat}} from the French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of {{the threat posed by}} the Italian Fleet to British North African operations, based in Egypt. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, {{considerably}} upsetting the balance of power, the Italians who were following the theory of a fleet in being had left their ships in harbour. This made the threat of a sortie against the British Fleet a serious problem. At the time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers. The Admiralty, concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> an attack, had drawn up Operation Judgement; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier , commanded by Lumley Lyster, to join HMS Eagle in Cunningham's fleet.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed to the British Waterways Board on 1 January 1963, {{and for the first}} time in over 100 years, it was managed by an {{organisation}} which was not under railway control. The Transport Act 1968 classified all waterways under the jurisdiction of British Waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. All of the remaining Shropshire Union network was designated as cruising waterway, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> leisure use. By that time there was little commercial traffic. The branch to the River Dee at Chester had been unused since 1932–34, with the demise of steel traffic from Shotton steelworks to Ellesmere Port, and long distance carrying of tar from Ellesmere Port to the Midlands had ended in 1957–58.|$|E

5|$|Players receive {{five points}} {{for a first}} team vote, three points for a second team vote, and one point for a third team vote. The five players with the highest point totals make the first team, with the next five making the second team and so forth. In {{the case of a}} tie at the fifth {{position}} of any team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> more expansion in the event of additional ties. A tie has occurred only once, in 1952, when Bob Davies and Dolph Schayes tied in votes received. From 1946 to 1955, players were selected without regard to position; however, since 1956, each team has consisted of two guards, two forwards, and one center.|$|E
5|$|Reports as to {{the size}} of the mosque have varied considerably. Ali Mangera of Mangera Yvars Architects, {{submitted}} a proposal for the design competition, stated that his design would accommodate up to 40,000visitors simultaneously, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> expanding to contain 70,000people. These figures led to much consternation. London Borough of Newham Councillor Alan Craig, of the Christian Peoples Alliance, criticised the development plans on the grounds that they would change the character of the local area, making it predominantly Muslim, and has called for a public inquiry into the mosque's development. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Newham planning department would refuse the mosque's application, as a project of that size had the potential to cause damage to community relations in the area.|$|E
5|$|The NBA All-Rookie Team is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) honor given since the 1962–63 NBA season {{to the top}} rookies during the regular season. Voting is {{conducted}} by the NBA head coaches; who {{are not allowed to}} vote for players on their own team. The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a first team and a second team. The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when Kawhi Leonard, Iman Shumpert, and Brandon Knight tied in votes received. No respect is given to positions. For example, the first team had four forwards, and one guard in 2008, while the first team had four centers (two of which were forward-centers) and one guard in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The UK Independence Party (UKIP) {{candidate}} was chosen via a selection committee, unlike previous mayoral candidate selections {{that had been}} made by London-based party members. The supposed favourite for selection among party members was Suzanne Evans, UKIP Deputy Chairman, former Interim Leader, Welfare Spokesman and candidate for Shrewsbury and Atcham in the 2015 general election. Press such as The Spectator speculated that the decision had been moved to a committee to allow for the selection of national party leader Nigel Farage's preferred candidate, Peter Whittle, Culture Spokesman and candidate for Eltham in the 2015 general election. UKIP claimed that the changed selection process was intended to produce a candidate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> receiving the most votes. Whittle was eventually selected, and announced as the candidate at the UKIP party conference on 26 September 2015. No shortlist was released but others who had stated their intention to stand had included: Alan Craig, former leader of and mayoral candidate in 2008 for the Christian Peoples Alliance, and UKIP candidate for Brent North in the 2015 general election; Peter Harris, candidate for Dagenham and Rainham in the 2015 general election; Richard Hendron, LGBT activist and candidate for Brentford and Isleworth in the 2015 general election; Elizabeth Jones, candidate for Dartford in the 2015 general election; David Kurten, candidate for Camberwell and Peckham in the 2015 general election; Winston McKenzie, perennial candidate and UKIP candidate for Croydon North in the 2015 general election; and Shneur Odze, former Hackney councillor.|$|E
