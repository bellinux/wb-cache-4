5|$|Rather {{than trying}} to release the game in tandem <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper made sure to give the {{developers}} {{as much time as}} they needed to finish the game. GoldenEye 007 was developed through two and a half years, the first year of which was spent developing the engine and producing art assets. The game was released on a 96Mb cartridge on 25 August 1997, nearly two years after the film. Additionally, every cartridge of the game contains a fully functional ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare staff and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches.|$|E
