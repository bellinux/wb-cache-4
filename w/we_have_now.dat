For example, with drink driving advertising in New Zealand, a decade ago we saw cars smashing into each other as a scare tactic. The content of these adverts has become less and less shocking the more we {{have been exposed to}} them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> become so desensitised to them that a humour approach has to be taken and the latest example is the ‘Legend’ advert.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E
25|$|The common {{heritage}} of humanity principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to {{the tragedy of the}} commons dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by Garrett Hardin in the journal Science in 1968. The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of conscience in achieving justice and equality in society. Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting economic rationalism on such social and ecosystems. Though there are many that point out that as what we are seeking is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on malthusian ideas of competition and over population, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment. Hardin, like many who criticise principles of commonality, have to rely on long debunked 18th century ideas to make their point.|$|E

[...] Batygin's and Brown's work is similar to how Urbain Le Verrier predicted the position of Neptune based on Alexis Bouvard's observations and theory of Uranus' peculiar motion.|$|E

By 1863, however, the minutes of {{a meeting of the}} Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War referred to Fort Runyon as [...] "an important work when it was first built, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> an exterior line of fortifications ... there is merely a guard in Fort Runyon now." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Emanuel also faced some {{criticism}} for {{his failure to}} support some progressive candidates, as Howard Dean advocated. Emanuel had [...] "aggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans". Many of the Representatives that Rahm had recruited such as Heath Shuler ending up [...] " [...] against important Obama Administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care". Howie Klein has suggested that Emanuel's congressional campaign strategy was short-sighted as it [...] "contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now,</b> the biggest since the nineteen-twenties" [...] when the Democrats {{lost control of the}} House in the 2010 midterm elections.|$|E
500|$|Ali Gomaa, the Grand Mufti of Egypt, said: [...] "I greet President Mubarak {{who offered}} {{dialogue}} {{and responded to}} the demands of the people.

I call on all parents to ask their children to stay home." [...] A former general who was a part of the intelligence services said that Mubarak would have no qualms about [...] "setting the whole country on fire." [...] Western media suggested the possibility of civil war as violence between the two sides escalated, leaving over a thousand injured.|$|E
500|$|Concomitant to the {{maritime}} subsistence hypothesis was an implied dominance of sites immediately {{adjacent to the}} coast over other centers. This idea was shaken by {{the realization of the}} magnitude of Caral, an inland site. Supplemental to Shady's 1997 article dating Caral, a 2001 Science news article emphasized the dominance of agriculture and also suggested that Caral was the oldest urban center in Peru (and the entire Americas). It deprecated the idea that civilization might have begun adjacent to the coast and then moved inland. One archaeologist was quoted as suggesting that [...] "rather than coastal antecedents to monumental inland sites, what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> are coastal satellite villages to monumental inland sites".|$|E

500|$|Frederick {{fought in}} the wars against Denmark, Austria and France. Although he had opposed {{military}} action in each case, once war had started he supported the Prussian military wholeheartedly and took positions of command. Since he had no political influence at all, these were opportunities to prove himself. Frederick experienced his first combat in the Second Schleswig War. Appointed to supervise the supreme German Confederation commander Field Marshal Wrangel and his staff, the Crown Prince tactfully managed disputes between Wrangel and the other officers. The Prussians and their Austrian allies defeated the Danes and conquered {{the southern part of}} Jutland, but after the war they spent two years politicking to assume leadership of the German states. This culminated in the Austro-Prussian War. Frederick [...] "was {{the only member of the}} Prussian Crown Council to uphold the rights of the Duke of Augustenberg and oppose the idea of a war with Austria which he described as fratricide." [...] Although he supported unification and the restoration of the medieval empire, [...] "Fritz could not accept that war was the right way to unite Germany.". However, when war with Austria broke out, he accepted command of one of Prussia's three armies, with General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal as his chief of staff. The timely arrival of his II Army was crucial to the Prussian victory in 1866 at the decisive Battle of Königgrätz, which won the war for Prussia. After the battle, William presented Frederick with the Order Pour le Mérite for his personal gallantry on the field and leadership of the II Army. Nevertheless, the bloodshed caused him great dismay. A few days before Königgrätz, Frederick had written to his wife, expressing his hope that this would be the last war he would have to fight. On the third day of the battle he wrote to her again: [...] "Who knows whether we may not have to wage a third war in order to keep what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> won?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2003, he made {{controversial}} {{comments about}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), saying: [...] "It's about time we started honouring those {{people involved in the}} armed struggle.

2500|$|On 9 October 2006, it was {{confirmed}} that the second series of Life on Mars would be the last.

Graham's claim that two endings had been filmed was later revealed to be a ruse.|$|E

2500|$|James Clerk Maxwell {{said of the}} aether, [...] "In several {{parts of}} this {{treatise}} an attempt {{has been made to}} explain electromagnetic phenomena by means of mechanical action transmitted from one body to another by means of a medium occupying the space between them.

2500|$|Subsequently however, {{a public}} {{statement}} signed by {{six of the}} 10 LSE student participants on the trip said that [...] "We feel that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been put in more risk than was originally the case, {{as a result of}} the LSE's decision to go public with their story".

2500|$|In 1973 she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma and later died of the same disease in 1974 in her home at the age of seventy. She attributed her getting cancer to her early years in college where she ate junk food before learning about its negative effects on health and a number of x-rays she underwent. Before her death she stated, [...] "In my opinion there is no question whatsoever that the terrific amount of cancer <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> is related to the inadequacies of our American diet." ...|$|E
