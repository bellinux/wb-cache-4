5|$|Fremantle Prison's {{officers}} {{were known as}} warders until the early 20th century. They lived in specially built terrace houses <b>within</b> <b>walking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. In the 1890s warders still had stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve-hour working days. Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902. As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship.|$|E
5|$|The ARS had the Blue Line end at Addison Road. However, {{sports fans}} {{continually}} {{argued for a}} three-mile (5km) extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland.

However, the extension still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is <b>within</b> <b>walking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FedExField football stadium. The extension cost $456 million.|$|E

5|$|Summer Hill's largest mansion, Carleton (now the Grosvenor Hospital's main building), {{was built}} in the early 1880s on Liverpool Road for Charles Carleton Skarrat. The suburb boomed {{with the opening of the}} railway station in 1879, and was {{followed}} by subdivision of much of the surrounding area. Between 1880 and 1910, the area became an upper-class suburb, and was a popular choice for professionals in banking and insurance who worked in the city. Subdivision of gardens for housing continued in the 1920s and 1930s, and socioeconomically the suburb changed as some of the wealthier inhabitants moved to the North Shore. Demolition of most of the surviving mansions in the 1970s allowed erection of home units, especially <b>within</b> <b>walking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway station.|$|E
