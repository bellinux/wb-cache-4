5|$|The Concert for Bangladesh {{was first}} issued on CD on 30 July 1991 in America and 19 August in Britain. It <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a two-disc set, with {{significant}} editing of the breaks between songs. Having stated his disappointment in a 1988 {{interview that the}} album {{had been allowed to}} go out of print, Harrison recorded a promotional interview on the 20th anniversary of the concerts, to accompany the CD release.|$|E

5|$|A one-man {{play about}} Mal Evans called Beatle Mal's Legendary Band was {{presented}} at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe between 5 and 27 August 2012. It had previously previewed at the Cavern Club in Liverpool on Wednesday 25 July, with members of Mal's family in the audience.

5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. When {{the last of his}} sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him {{inferior}} to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed. Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E

In the second season, Whitmore was replaced {{in the lead}} role by comedian Paul Lynde, and Asher was replaced as producer by Duke Vincent and Bruce Johnson. The series was re-titled The New Temperatures Rising Show, and featured a new supporting cast: Sudie Bond, Barbara Cason, Jennifer Darling, Jeff Morrow, and John Dehner. Cleavon Little was the only returning member of the original cast.

They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{the same}} game {{structure}} can always <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a gain or a loss game. Because of the Framing effect players respond completely differently when it <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a gain or a loss. If public good games <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a loss, i.e. a player's contribution in a private engagement diminishes other player's payoff, contributions are significantly lower.|$|R

5|$|New Labour {{refers to}} a period {{in the history of}} the British Labour Party from the mid-1990s until 2010, under the {{leadership}} of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The name dates from a conference slogan first used by the party in 1994, later seen in a draft manifesto published in 1996, New Labour, New Life for Britain. It <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> the brand of a newly reformed party that had altered Clause IV and endorsed market economics.

Chi-square tests were used for dichotomous data.|$|R
5|$|Star Trek {{has been}} blended with Gilbert and Sullivan at least twice. The North Toronto Players {{presented}} a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan entitled H.M.S.

5|$|The project <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} {{original}} proposal of the Bergen Line when approved by Parliament in 1894, but due to the narrow gauge on the Drammen Line at the time, a temporary solution via Roa was chosen instead. Later proposals have been launched, and parliament has voted over it in 1954, 1978, 1984 and 1992; only the last being passed, but not followed up by funding, and the Norwegian National Rail Administration has not allocated any date to start construction; detailed plans have however been produced.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
5|$|After the May elections, the Grinius/Sleževičius {{government}} lifted martial law, {{still in}} effect in Kaunas and other localities, restored democratic freedoms, and granted broad amnesty to political prisoners. For the first time, Lithuania had become truly democratic. However, the change {{did not meet}} with universal approval. Many of the released prisoners were communists who quickly used the new freedoms of speech to organize a protest attended by approximately 400 people in Kaunas on 13 June. The protest was dispersed. The new government's opposition used this protest as the platform for a public attack on the government, alleging that it was allowing illegal organizations (the Communist Party of Lithuania was still outlawed) to continue their activities freely. Despite its local nature, the incident <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{a major threat to}} Lithuania and its military; the government was said to be incapable of dealing with this threat.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} content-independent {{formulation}} of higher cognitive pedagogy, by identifying higher cognitive pedagogy with executive function {{which in turn}} we equate with continual multi-dimensional processing of drivers of outcomes. The key focus in this definition is on multiple dimensions.

We show consistency and correlation between the executive-function pedagogical approach and the Bloom-Anderson approach...|$|R
