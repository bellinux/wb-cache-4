5|$|The {{rules by}} which signs can be {{combined}} to form <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> are called syntax or grammar.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in and around Madras (now Chennai) and wrapped in December 1954. Missamma was released on 12 January 1955, two days before Missiamma theatrical debut. Both versions were commercially successful, completing 100-day theatrical runs. The bilingual film brought recognition to its cast and studio, and <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> from Missamma became part of Telugu vernacular. AVM Productions remade the film in Hindi as Miss Mary in 1957, Prasad's Bollywood directorial debut. Bapu, Mullapudi Venkata Ramana and Raavi Kondala Rao rewrote and adapted Missamma as Pelli Pustakam in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology {{are central to}} Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E
40|$|The {{factor of}} failure in Arabic {{language}} learning in Indonesia {{is the lack}} of activities in language learning. One of language learning activities is identifying meaning or <b>word</b> meaning <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> in dictionary.

After having collected the <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> index that were collected from teaching materials of Arabic language at MI non-pesantren in Indonesia, then it was tested at MIN Malang. The result showed that: there was a development in Arabic language learning through <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> index; that was students’ competence to identify meaning and collaboration in understanding text and context in a sentence.

5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases.</b> When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E

5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases.</b> Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases.</b> The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E
5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} {{in language and}} communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E

5|$|Linguistic {{study of}} the Khmer {{language}} divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrases</b> in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following {{the end of the}} Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E

The stimuli consisted of vowels embedded in a two-syllable nonsense word that were varied systematically with respect to <b>phrase</b> position <b>and</b> focal accent. At phrase level, the results showed that FL in accented words in IDS was significantly greater as compared to ADS. Earlier studies have shown that young children are sensitive to pauses as markers to phrase constituents. In line with these experiments, the perceptual importance of FL in IDS is discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to convert the}} prosody {{boundary}} detection task into a syllable position labeling task. In order to detect both prosodic <b>word</b> <b>and</b> prosodic <b>phrase</b> boundaries, 6 types of syllable positions are defined. For each position, context-dependent position models are trained from manually labeled data. These models are used to label syllable positions in unseen speech. <b>Word</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> boundaries are then easily derived from syllable position labels. The proposed approach is tested with a large scale single speaker database. The precision <b>and</b> recall for <b>word</b> boundary are 96. 1 % and 90. 1 %, respectively, <b>and</b> for <b>phrase</b> boundary are 83. 7 % and 80. 5 %, respectively. Results of a listening test shows that only 28 % of <b>word</b> boundaries <b>and</b> 50 % of phrase of boundaries detected automatically are critical error, implying only about 2. 2 % and 10 % errors for <b>word</b> <b>and</b> <b>phrase</b> boundaries, respectively. The results are rather good, especially when it is considered that only acoustic features are used in this work.
