The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition HDW-F900 video camera, the same model used in the production of the three Star Wars prequels. About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in public art for the project. Faculty from Columbia College Chicago was also involved in the production of the video.

500|$|The first {{rehearsal}} in March 1942 {{was intended}} to be three hours long, but had to be stopped after 15 minutes because the 30 musicians present were too weak to play their instruments. They frequently collapsed during rehearsals, especially those playing brass instruments. Eliasberg himself had to be dragged to rehearsals on a sledge, and was eventually moved by Communist officials to an apartment nearby and given a bicycle for transport. His first attempts at conducting <b>were</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "wounded bird with wings that are going to drop at any moment". A report by Babushkin noted that [...] "the first violin is dying, the drum died on his way to work, the French horn is at death's door...". Orchestral players were given additional rations (donated by civilian music enthusiasts) in an effort to combat starvation, and hot bricks were used to radiate heat; nevertheless, three performers died during rehearsals. Posters went up around the city requesting all musicians to report to the Radio Committee for incorporation into the orchestra. Performers were also recalled from the front or reassigned from Soviet military bands {{with the support of the}} Soviet commander of the Leningrad front, Leonid Govorov.|$|E

[...] With the Peppers now playing shows at arenas rather than theaters, the promoters of the tour decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act. Kiedis contacted Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, {{and asked him if}} Nirvana would replace Pearl Jam on the tour—an offer Grohl accepted. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, however, refused to play with Nirvana as he once dated frontman Kurt Cobain's wife Courtney Love. The Pumpkins were, therefore, taken off the concert bill and replaced with Pearl Jam. Their first show with Nirvana was at the L.A Sports Arena. Kiedis considered their act to be [...] "raw energy; their musicality, their song selection, they <b>were</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chain saw cutting through the night."

500|$|Before {{the end of}} 1971, the Kinks {{signed a}} five-album deal with RCA Records and {{received}} a million-dollar advance, which helped fund the construction of their own recording studio, Konk. Their debut for RCA, Muswell Hillbillies, was replete with the influence of music hall and traditional American musical styles, including country and bluegrass. It is often hailed as their last great record, {{though it was not}} as successful as its predecessors. It was named after Muswell Hill, where the Davies brothers were brought up, and contained songs focusing on working-class life and, again, the Davies' childhood. Muswell Hillbillies, despite positive reviews and high expectations, peaked at number 48 on the Record World chart and number 100 on the Billboard chart. It was followed in 1972 by a double album, Everybody's in Show-Biz, which consisted of both studio tracks and live numbers recorded during a two-night stand at Carnegie Hall. The record featured the ballad [...] "Celluloid Heroes" [...] and the Caribbean-themed [...] "Supersonic Rocket Ship", their last UK Top 20 hit for more than a decade. [...] "Celluloid Heroes" [...] is a bitter-sweet rumination on dead and fading Hollywood stars (Mickey Rooney was still alive), in which the narrator declares that he wishes his life <b>were</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> movie, [...] "because celluloid heroes never feel any pain ... and celluloid heroes never really die." [...] The album was moderately successful in the United States, peaking at number 47 in Record World and number 70 in Billboard. It marks the transition between the band's early 1970s rock material and the theatrical incarnation in which they immersed themselves for the next four years.|$|E

Sadoveanu, a traditionalist among the Poporanists, much celebrated for his historical novels, antagonized the nationalist publications when, in that context, he explicitly stated a commitment to democratic methods. Among many others, Alexandru Gregorian denounced Sadoveanu for [...] "betrayal", in the Sfarmă-Piatră piece M. Sadoveanu. Împărat ("M. Sadoveanu. Emperor"). Gregorian described his rival as manipulated by the Jewish entrepreneur Breuer, and, emphasizing Sadoveanu's prominent status within Romanian Freemasonry, a worshiper of both the Supreme Architect and Ucigă-l toaca (that is, the devil). His two newspapers, Gregorian claimed, <b>were</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "ghetto", with Sadoveanu as a circumcised [...] "aurochs of Moldavia".

2500|$|Seeking to musically express Raekwon's {{blend of}} Five Percenter creed and inner-city experience, {{producer}} RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered {{than that of}} Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from Kung Fu movies, and Mafia films. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... to play like scenes in a crime movie. RZA has cited soul musician Isaac Hayes as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks. He also later revealed {{that several of the}} album's beats, such as [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces," [...] were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's Liquid Swords album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for Cuban Linx. In regard to this, Raekwon clarified [...] "RZA's house was more or less like a candy store. You come in and have all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats <b>were</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> grab bag.

At what was described as a [...] "stormy" [...] Cabinet meeting on May 30, 2002, Chrétien stated that he intended to serve out his entire term, and ordered the end of all leadership fundraising. Martin left his cabinet on June 2, 2002. Martin claimed that Chrétien dismissed him from Cabinet, while Chrétien said that Martin had resigned. In his memoirs, Chrétien wrote that he regretted not having fired Martin a few years earlier. In the aftermath of Martin's departure from the Cabinet, there occurred an angry caucus meeting on June 5, 2002, where much of the caucus came out in support of Martin; demanded that he fire his much hated communications director Françoise Ducros, who many MPs claimed was impossible to work with, leading to a chorus of MPs chanting [...] "Bring back Peter, bring back Peter" [...] (a reference to Ducros's predecessor Peter Donolo); and several pro-Martin M.Ps asked forthright for Chrétien to resign. Liberal MP Dan McTeague told Chrétien that [...] "You made a decision for Paul Martin. You should make the same decision for yourself". Many of the MPs accused the PMO of riding roughshod over them, and accused the prime minister of being a bully. Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish recalled about that caucus meeting that she could not believe that [...] "these ungrateful sons of bitches", as she called the pro-Martin MPs, would attack Chrétien at a caucus meeting so openly. For Chrétien's reaction, Parrish stated: [...] "His face was evil.
