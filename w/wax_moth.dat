25|$|A strong hive {{generally}} {{needs no}} treatment to control wax moths; the bees themselves kill and {{clean out the}} moth larvae and webs. <b>Wax</b> <b>moth</b> larvae may fully develop in cell cleanings when such cleanings accumulate thickly where they are not accessible to the bees.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wax</b> <b>moth</b> {{development}} in comb {{is generally not}} a problem with top bar hives, as unused combs are usually left in the hive during the winter. Since this type of hive is not used in severe wintering conditions, the bees are able to patrol and inspect the unused comb.|$|E
2500|$|When honey supers {{are stored}} {{for the winter}} in a mild climate, or in heated storage, the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larvae can destroy {{portions}} of the comb, though they will not fully develop. Damaged comb may be scraped out and [...] replaced by the bees. <b>Wax</b> <b>moth</b> larvae and eggs are killed by freezing, so storage in unheated sheds or barns in higher latitudes is the only control necessary.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Wax</b> <b>moths</b> can be {{controlled}} chemically with paradichlorobenzene (moth crystals or urinal disks). [...] If chemical methods are used, the combs must be well-aired for several days before use.

[...] Control of <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> by other means includes the freezing of the comb for at least 24 hours.|$|R
25|$|Because <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> cannot {{survive a}} cold winter, {{they are usually}} {{not a problem for}} beekeepers in the {{northern}} U.S. or Canada, unless they survive winter in heated storage, or are brought from the south by purchase or migration of beekeepers.

50|$|These animals {{should be}} housed in pairs in a well planted terrarium. The {{temperature}} should be between 25 and 28 C. The humidity should be maintained between 75. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, <b>wax</b> <b>moths,</b> fruits flies, mealworms and houseflies.|$|R
50|$|Wax worms are {{the larvae}} of <b>wax</b> <b>moths.</b> They are {{caterpillars}} {{that are used}} widely across {{the world for a}} variety of uses such as human and reptile food, fish bait, animal testing and even plastic degradation. Wax worms have high fat content, making them a valuable source of fat for many animals and insectivorous organisms. Wax worms are popular {{in many parts of the}} world due to their ability to live in low temperatures and their simplicity in production. Wax worms are bred by putting <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> in a container often filled with ground bran, oatmeal, and cereal grains along with <b>wax</b> paper. The <b>moths</b> lay eggs that then become larvae. The wax worm caterpillars then feed on their bedding until they are large enough for consumption. Wax worms are eaten cooked, fried, fresh, or baked in to other things. They are also often used as a garnish. Wax worms are said to taste like pine-nuts and butter.|$|R

40|$|Plant allelo{{chemicals}} are nonnutritional {{chemicals that}} interfere with the biology of herbivores. We posed the hypothesis that ingestion of a glycoalkaloid allelochemical, α-solanine, impairs biological parameters of greater <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> Galleria mellonella. To test this idea, we reared <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> on artificial diets with 0. 015, 0. 15, or 1. 5 mg/ 100 g diet of α-solanine. Addition of α-solanine to the diet affected survival of seventh-instar larvae, pupae, and adults; and female fecundity and fertility. The diet containing the highest α-solanine concentration led to decreased survivorship, fecundity, and fertility. The diets supplemented with α-solanine led to increased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in midgut and fat body and the effect was dose-dependent. Dietary α-solanine led to increased midgut glutathione S-transferase activity and to decreased fat body glutathione S-transferase activitiy. We infer from these findings that α-solanine influences life history parameters and antioxidative enzyme activities in the midgut and fat body of G. mellonell...|$|R
40|$|Greater <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> (Galleria mellonella L., Pyraloidea) use {{ultrasound}} sensitive ears {{to detect}} clicking conspecifics and echolocating bats. Pyralid ears have four sensory cells, A 14. The audiogram of G. mellonella has best frequency at 60 kHz with a threshold around 47 dB sound pressure level. A 1 and A 2 have almost equal thresholds {{in contrast to}} noctuids and geometrids. A 3 responds at + 12 to + 16 dB relative to the A 1 threshold. The threshold data from the A-cells give no indication of frequency discrimination in greater <b>wax</b> <b>moths.</b> Tethered greater <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> respond to ultrasound with short-latency cessation of flight at + 20 to + 25 dB relative to the A 1 threshold. The behavioural threshold curve parallels the audiogram, thus further corroborating the lack of frequency discrimination. Hence, the distinction between bats and conspecifics is probably based on temporal cues. At a constant duty cycle (percentage of time where sound is on) the pulse repetition rate {{has no effect on}} the threshold for flight cessation, but stimulus duration affects both sensory and behavioural thresholds. The maximum integration time is essentially the same: 45 ms for the A 1 -cell and 50 – 60 ms for the flight cessation response. However, the slopes of the time-intensity trade-off functions are very different: − 2. 1 dB per doubling of sound duration for the A 1 -cell threshold, and − 7. 2 dB per doubling of sound duration for the behavioural threshold. The significance of the results for sexual acoustic communication as well as for bat defence is discussed...|$|R
