5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer,</b> while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
25|$|The usual Daimler luxury {{fittings}} included: {{heating and}} ventilating equipment, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer,</b> cigar lighter, lockable glove compartment, two courtesy lights when any door is opened, special reading lights for passengers, spring-balanced lid for the luggage compartment which is illuminated {{when the car}} sidelights are in use, etc.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 a {{study by}} the UK Health Protection Agency {{reported}} that 20% of cases may be caused by infected <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> systems filled with pure water. The finding came after researchers spotted that professional drivers are five times more likely to contract the disease. No cases of infected systems were found whenever a suitable washer fluid was used.|$|E
50|$|Optional extras {{included}} a heater, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers,</b> radio and leather upholstery {{to replace the}} standard PVC.|$|R
5000|$|... 1978: All models {{now have}} hydragas {{suspension}} instead of previous hydrolastic system, and all models now feature electric <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers.</b> The HL loses its {{three-spoke steering wheel}} and a walnut finish dash replaces its padded dash.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{available}} in standard or special equipment versions with the former lacking a tachometer, heater (available as an option), <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers,</b> fog lights and cigarette lighter. Both versions did however have leather upholstery and polished walnut trim.|$|R
2500|$|British-made Mokes were {{fitted with}} a low-end 848cc {{transverse}} inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10inch wheels as the standard Mini. In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> and a removable canvas top were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves. The base price was GB£ 405. The [...] "Mk I" [...] Mokes had a single windscreen wiper and a floor-mounted headlight dip switch, and the only colour available was [...] "Spruce Green". In 1967, the [...] "Mk II" [...] Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.|$|E

50|$|October 1963: All models had the <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> bottle {{relocated}} {{to prevent it}} from freezing up.|$|E
5000|$|The XT Falcon {{range was}} {{introduced}} in March 1968 [...] as a facelifted version of the XR Falcon, which it replaced. The XT featured a revised grille and taillights and improved safety features including split-system brakes, larger tyres and electrically operated <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The car had {{front and}} rear bench seats, which were covered, as standard, in Vynide. Leather was an option on the home market and cloth for {{exported}} models. A heater and (unusual for the time) electric <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers</b> were factory fitted, although a radio remained an option.|$|R
50|$|The {{first few}} cars {{retained}} the Imp rear cooling radiator but tended to overheat so in 1969 a Mk ii version with front mounted radiator with electric fan was fiited instead which cured the problem. The Mk II {{also had a}} revised dashboard and improved seats. A heater and <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers</b> were optional extras.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{like the}} Volkswagen Beetle used spare tires for {{ancillary}} purposes such as supplying air {{pressure to the}} <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> system.|$|E
50|$|The usual Daimler luxury {{fittings}} included: {{heating and}} ventilating equipment, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer,</b> cigar lighter, lockable glove compartment, two courtesy lights when any door is opened, special reading lights for passengers, spring-balanced lid for the luggage compartment which is illuminated {{when the car}} sidelights are in use, etc.|$|E
5000|$|A minor {{facelift}} on the 2005 {{model year}} featured redesigned {{front and rear}} aprons, a slightly modified grille, remodeled rear light clusters, an aluminium bonnet, and a new 2.7-litre V6 diesel engine with [...] The <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> jets were incorporated into the windscreen wiper arms. There were no changes made to the cabin interior. 2006 to 2008 models featured no fog lights.|$|E
5000|$|April 1974: Introduction of the R5 LS, {{same as the}} R5 TL {{but with}} a larger 1.3 engine, {{different}} design steel wheels, H4 iodine headlights, electric <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers,</b> fully carpeted floor ahead of the front seats, carpeted rear parcel shelf, electronic rev counter, daily totalizer, two-speed ventilation system, rear wiper, and illuminated ashtray with cigarette lighter.|$|R
5000|$|The Zephyr Zodiac (or Zodiac Mark I) was an {{upmarket}} {{version of}} the Zephyr launched at the London Motor Show in autumn 1953. It had two-tone paintwork, leather trim, a heater, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers,</b> whitewall tyres, and spot lights. The engine had a higher compression ratio - 7.5:1 instead of 6.8:1 - increasing the maximum power to [...]|$|R
50|$|Second Series Volgas were {{introduced}} in 1959, with a new grille painted the body color or in chrome. Halfway through the 1959 production run (model year 1959½), a vinyl cover {{was added to the}} dash. Added were <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers</b> and tubeless tires. just Before the series concluded, telescopic shocks replaced the lever type. The 1961 Volgas were priced at 5,100 rubles.|$|R
5000|$|Affectionately {{known as}} the [...] "Bugeye" [...] the Australian model prefix was YHAN1, and {{assembly}} numbers started at number 501. The BMC A-Series engine 9C-U-H (948cc) motor {{was used for the}} model. Front bumpers, tachometer, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer,</b> locking petrol cap and tonneau cover were standard on Australian cars (these items being optional extras on UK cars). Price was 998 pounds (Australian), plus on road costs. 894 Mk1 Sprites were assembled in Australia.|$|E
50|$|In warmer climates, {{water may}} also work, {{but it can}} freeze in colder climates, {{damaging}} the pump. Although automobile antifreeze is chemically similar to windscreen wiper fluid, {{it should not be}} used because it can damage paint. The earliest documented idea for having a windshield wiper unit hooked up to a windshield washer fluid reservoir was in 1931, Richland Auto Parts Co, Mansfield, Ohio. Uruguayan racecar driver and mechanic Héctor Suppici Sedes developed a <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> in the late 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|The Alexander TS {{also came}} with a {{completely}} redesigned back axle, which significantly improved the car's handling, and anticipated the rear-suspension configuration on the Lloyd Arabella (which appeared in Lloyd showrooms the next year). [...] The rear axle was attached using semi-trailing arms (generally identified in contemporary sources simply as [...] "trailing arms") with [...] "progressively acting" [...] coil springs. The TS also incorporated detailed enhancements such as the <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> system and, new for 1957, asymmetrically dipping headlight beams.|$|E
50|$|The Meridian {{system is}} also {{equipped}} with subwoofers and Audyssey MultEQ audio tuning system. Also a 5-inch colour display screen is standard {{even at the}} newer entry-level models. An optional cold climate package includes heated front windscreen, heated front seats with two heating levels and heated <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers.</b> The optional lighting package includes bi-xenon headlights, adaptive front-lighting, memory for the driver seat, as well as exterior mirrors and approach and puddle lamps.|$|R
50|$|Individual {{seats were}} fitted in the front, with a bench {{at the rear}} that could fold down to {{increase}} luggage capacity. The trim material was a vinyl treated fabric. Options included a heater, radio, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers</b> and white-wall tyres. The gearchange lever was floor-mounted with the handbrake between the seats. The door windows were not opened by conventional winders, but pulled up and down using finger grips; a window lock position was on the door handle.|$|R
5000|$|February 1976: Introduction of the R5 Alpine, with 1397 cc engine with {{hemispherical}} combustion chambers, {{high compression}} ratio and special five-speed manual gearbox. The R5 GTL was also launched in 1976 with the 1289 cc engine from the R5 TS (with the power reduced to 42 bhp), the equipment specification of the R5 TL plus grey side protection strips and some features from the R5 TS {{such as the}} styled wheel rims, reversing lights, cigarette lighter, illuminated heater panel, and electric <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Charger was now {{marketed as}} the Chrysler Charger {{rather than as}} the Chrysler Valiant Charger [...] with Chrysler script badging having {{replaced}} Valiant badging front and rear. Some further changes with the VK model included 'white-out' grille treatment, revised rear light clusters, and revised 'C' pillar ornamentation utilising extended fibreglass panels in black, incorporating XL or 770 badge identification. Inside, wiper and <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> controls were now integrated into the indicator stalk and there were also some trim revisions that included bold Boca-Raton cloth seat inserts for the Charger 770.|$|E
5000|$|For 1962, the Beetle {{received}} a mechanical fuel level gauge {{in place of}} the former fuel tap. The Standard model continued without a gas gauge {{until the end of the}} 1965 model year. At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> was replaced by a new design using compressed air. A Schrader valve located on the washer fluid tank allowed the system to be charged at a filling station to the recommended [...]|$|E
50|$|The 16-slit {{vertical}} grille for {{models from}} 1958 (which {{gave it the}} unofficial nickname Akula (Shark)) was by far not the only change. Most of the changes came in February 1959, and included new front fenders with raised wheel arches, reflector glasses in the tail lights, a flock trim on the dashboard (later replaced by leatherette), a new radio with a metallic mesh speaker, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> and lock actuator on the boot. The following year {{was to have a}} new rear design with more contemporary tailfins http://www.gaz21volga.com/21/21_proto_1958/2serie_proto_003.jpg, but this was not implemented. Instead, the car body received several reinforcement supports and the novel, but ultimately troublesome central lubrication system was removed.|$|E
5000|$|Although more {{expensive}} than its opposition, the Freeway was well equipped by contemporary standards, offering features such as <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers</b> and a fresh air heater / demister. The sedan combined a new full-width grille with the rear-end styling of the British MG Magnette and Riley 4 models. The station wagon utilised the Austin A60 Cambridge rear-end styling.3,090 units were sold {{in its first year}} but volumes fell well short of those of its Holden and Ford Falcon rivals and of the much more powerful six-cylinder Chrysler Valiant, introduced in Australia earlier the same year.|$|R
50|$|The Holden HR {{range was}} {{released}} in April 1966, replacing the Holden HD series which had been in production since 1965. In addition to a revised grille, the HR featured a reworked roofline and larger rear window (on the sedans), revised rear lights (on sedans and wagons) and changes to almost all exterior body panels.Other changes included revised ball joint front suspension, widened track, improved interior trim and woodgrain interior finish for the Premier models. Six months after {{the launch of the}} HR, all models were given a safety upgrade with the addition of front safety belts, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers,</b> reversing lights, sunvisors and a shatterproof interior rearview mirror.|$|R
50|$|The final {{members of}} the series were the 95 and 110. The Rover 95 was a re-geared for economy Rover 100 offered at the price level of the four-cylinder Rover 80 it replaced. The Rover 110 was a Rover 100 with a more {{powerful}} engine. Announced 27 September 1962 these cars represented {{the end of an}} era. They were fitted with not alloy but steel door panels to reduce cost. Their very full equipment included electric <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers.</b> Although the Roverdrive automatic had been put to rest, overdrive was standard on the 110. The 95 made do with a higher ratio final drive (3.9:1).|$|R
50|$|Factory {{options and}} extras - Triumph offered {{a wide range}} of {{optional}} parts and accessories for both the competition-minded enthusiast and those simply wishing to personalize their vehicle. While many of these items were factory fitments, local dealers supplied some as well. Among these were: overdrive, wire wheels (48-spoke, 60-spoke available from 1959), steel hardtop kit (part No. 900711), occasional rear seat (No. 801264), push-button radio, interior heater, leather upholstery, <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> (No. 553729), cast aluminium sump (No. 502126), 2138cc engine (from 1959), aluminum ‘Al-fin’ brake drums (No. 202267 or No. 301590 (9- and 10-inch respectively)), spot and fog lamps (Nos. 501703, 501702), and a continental touring kit (No. 502022, spares for travels in remote regions).|$|E
50|$|The Twingo III {{is about}} 100 mm {{shorter than the}} Twingo II. The rear-engine layout {{improves}} the manoeuvrability and the cabin space, but reduced the boot capacity. The suspension is composed by MacPherson struts on the front axle and a De Dion tube on the rear. The car uses a five-door architecture, which differs it from its three-door predecessors. Brakes are ventilated disks {{on the front and}} drums on the rear, except in the base model (SCe 70) which uses drum brakes all-round. The bonnet features a special opening mechanism and allows only partial opening to give access to the <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> fluid, brake fluid and coolant reservoirs, and to the battery.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1959 {{model year}} the company {{introduced}} an Ariane Super Luxe with {{increased levels of}} chrome trim on the outside as well as vanity mirrors {{on the inside and}} a <b>windscreen</b> <b>washer</b> to help the view out. All the Arianes also received restyled tail light clusters at this point which resembled those already used on the more flamboyantly styled but broadly similar Vedette models. Further upgrades to the interior trim were implemented for 1961, and newly available options included bench seats that could now be folded flat to form a double bed of sorts. [...] There followed yet another new name: for the final two years of its life the Ariane was branded as the Simca Miramas.|$|E
5000|$|... 1972: Introduction of the Maxi 1750 HL, {{with twin}} SU HS6 {{carburettor}} {{version of the}} 1748 cc engine, which gave a higher output of [...] at 5250 rpm. Other additional features for the HL were 165 x 13 radial ply tyres, black grille with chrome upper and lower strips, with red [...] "HL" [...] motif fitted, red chequered front badge, front bumper under-riders, chrome exhaust trim, black rimmed hub caps, body coloured mouldings along the sides and rear, electric <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers,</b> 3 spoke-alloy steering wheel with leather-bound rim, padded vinyl dashboard, dipping rear view mirror, vanity mirror on passenger sun visor, front door pockets, simulated wooden gear knob and brushed nylon upholstery.|$|R
40|$|As {{early as}} 1982, {{with the release}} of Jerzy Skolimowski’s German-British co-production Moonlighting, filmmakers from various European {{countries}} (the UK, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, [...] .) have been engaged in adapting aspects of Polish migration in cinematographic fiction. This device has become particularly widespread during the past ten years, when at least five European movies featuring Polish immigrant characters have made it to the screens (viz., La Ballata dei Lavavetri (Ballad of the <b>Windscreen</b> <b>Washers</b> – 1998), De Poolse bruid (The Polish Bride – 1998), Small Time Obsession (2000), Fyra Veckor I Juni (Four Weeks in June – 2004), It’s a Free World (2007)). The present paper will investigate to what extent and in what ways Polish migrant culture is represented in these films. status: accepte...|$|R
5000|$|The Ascona B {{retained}} the same engine range as its predecessor, versions with higher compression ratio and needing 98 octane petrol, dubbed S, were available alongside the 90 octane models. The first change {{took place in}} January 1976, when laminated window glass became available as a no-cost option. The 1.9 L [...] "S" [...] cam-in-head engine {{was replaced by the}} modernised 2.0 L (20S) in September 1977. The 20N became available in January 1978, and all models now also received electric <b>windscreen</b> <b>washers.</b> A 2.0 L diesel motor was added to the Ascona B range in 1978, mostly targeted at the BeNeLux countries and Italy, where local tax structures provided an incentive for diesel-powered automobiles - in 1979, 97% of diesels were exported, while 59% of petrol powered cars went in the export.|$|R
