5|$|In January 1689, a Convention Parliament {{assembled}} in England {{and declared that}} James had effectively abdicated when he fled, and that the thrones of England and Ireland were therefore vacant.

5|$|In late 1077 {{or early}} 1078 trouble began between <b>William</b> <b>and</b> his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis {{describes}} it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers, <b>William</b> <b>and</b> Henry, including a story that the quarrel was started when <b>William</b> <b>and</b> Henry threw water at Robert, {{it is much more}} likely that Robert was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William's supporters. Included among them was Robert of Belleme, William de Breteuil, and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band of young men went to the castle at Remalard, where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William's continental enemies. William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at Gerberoi, where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces sallied from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman. William's forces were forced to lift the siege, and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, <b>William</b> <b>and</b> Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died.|$|E
