5|$|Although he {{left the}} {{direction}} of the battle to subordinates, General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general for the greatest American victory of the war to date. He may have conspired <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> replace George Washington as the commander-in-chief. Instead, he received the command of the main American army in the South. He led it to a disastrous defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field again.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian and Dutch governments {{subsequently}} {{ordered the}} improved Hunter F.6, with Nos. 1, 7 and 9 Wings of the Belgian Air Force receiving 112 Fokker-built aircraft between 1957 and 1958. Although {{built in the}} Netherlands, 29 aircraft had been assembled from kits in Belgium by SABCA and 59 by Avions Fairey, and were operated by 7 and 9 Wings. No. 9 Wing was disbanded in 1960, and by 1963 the Hunter squadrons in 7 Wing had also been disbanded. A large number of the surviving Hunters were sold to Hawker Aircraft and re-built for re-export to India and Iraq, <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> Chile, Kuwait and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Training {{can help}} the user make use of their AAC system to {{communicate}} effectively <b>with</b> <b>others,</b> <b>to</b> control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes. Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Until 1914, {{artillery}} generally fired over open sights at visible targets, {{the largest}} unit accustomed to firing {{at a single}} target was the artillery regiment or brigade. One innovation {{brought about by the}} adoption of trench warfare was the barrage—a term first used in the battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915. Trench warfare had created the need for indirect fire, with the use of observers, more sophisticated artillery fire plans, and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery, where artillerymen had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns. Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> form a pattern; {{in the case of a}} barrage, the pattern was a line.|$|E

5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined {{together to make a}} map of the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> make a map of the hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts). If there was any trouble about the collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or if the question of chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial officials could readily carry out their duties by the aid of the maps.|$|E
5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election. Afterward, with the financial aid of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.|$|E
