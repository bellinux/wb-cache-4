40|$|The {{goal for}} this thesis is to {{minimize}} clearances and tolerances, {{in order to}} prevent water leakage. A proper seal on the seal rings does not let excess water flow through the turbine runner, thus conserving more water and wasting less energy. Moreover, water leakage past worn <b>wear</b> <b>plates</b> allows for an extra load for the turbine when operating in condense mode. When the wicket gates are closed, water leakage past worn plates wastes mechanical energy in the water; thus, decreasing the efficiency of the Francis turbine, especially when operating at partial loads. Furthermore, the wicket gates also known as guide vanes can increase the efficiency of the turbine in their relation to their laminar profile and proper seal. Water is a very vital resource in today 2 ̆ 7 s society. This thesis illustrates how existing hydro machinery can be improved to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels as an electric energy source. This study provides actual examples of improvements using the generating units located at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam located in Boulder City, NV is part of the Lower Colorado Region, of the U. S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation. Overhauling a hydro unit to obtain better efficiency is very similar to overhauling a vehicles engine to improve the vehicles fuel economy. Modifying and replacing three major hydro-machinery components: seal rings, <b>wear</b> <b>plates,</b> and wicket gates, improves the efficiency of Hoover Dam units by an average of 2 percent. This increase in capacity equates to an additional 8, 000 MW-hrs per year per unit.

Design/methodology/approach: <b>Wear</b> resistant <b>plates</b> can be used for elements working in intensive abrasion resistance conditions to obtain considerable material and economical savings based on the manufacturing costs reducing and decreasing turnaround time for replacing worn parts. During the welding process of two materials, when one is <b>wear</b> <b>plate</b> and the other is steel plate significant structure changes and mixing of alloying components in weld area are observed. Findings: Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of <b>wear</b> resistant <b>plate</b> with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root, most of important changes during welding of wear resistant material are connected with melting, mixing and carbides passage into weld area, non uniform chemical composition of the welded joint creates different microstructures with different hardness.

40|$|Intensive {{quenching}} (IQ) {{process is}} an alternative way of hardening (quenching) steel parts {{through the use of}} highly agitated water and then still air. It was developed by IQ Technologies, Inc. (IQT) of Akron, Ohio. While conventional quenching is usually performed in environmentally unfriendly oil or water/polymer solutions, the IQ process uses highly agitated environmentally friendly water or low concentration water/mineral salt solutions. The IQ method is characterized by extremely high cooling rates of steel parts. In contrast to conventional quenching, where parts cool down to the quenchant temperature and usually have tensile or neutral residual surface stresses at the end of quenching. The IQ process is interrupted when the part core is still hot and when there are maximum compressive stresses deep into the parts, thereby providing hard, ductile, better wear resistant parts. The project goal was to advance the patented IQ process from feasibility to commercialization in the heat-treating and forging industries to reduce significantly energy consumption and environmental impact, to increase productivity and to enhance economic competitiveness of these industries as well as Steel, Metal Casting and Mining industries. To introduce successfully the IQ technology in the U. S. metal working industry, the project team has completed the following work over the course of this project: A total of 33 manufacturers of steel products provided steel parts for IQ trails. IQT conducted IQ demonstrations for 34 different steel parts. Our customers tested intensively quenched parts in actual field conditions to evaluate the product service life and performance improvement. The data obtained from the field showed the following: Service life (number of holes punched) of cold-work punches (provided by EHT customer and made of S 5 shock-resisting steel) was improved by two to eight times. Aluminum extrusion dies provided by GAM and made of hot work H- 13 steel outperformed the standard dies by at least 50 %. Dies provided by an AST customer, made of plain carbon 1045 steel and used for pellet manufacturing outperformed the standard dies by more than 100 %. Concrete crusher liner <b>wear</b> <b>plates</b> provided by an EHT customer and made of 1045 steel, had the same surface hardness as the plates made of more expensive, pre-hardened high alloy HARDOX- 500 material supplied by a Swedish company and used currently by the EHT customer. The 1045 material intensively quenched <b>wear</b> <b>plates</b> are currently in the field. Concrete block molding machine <b>wear</b> <b>plates</b> provided by an IQT customer and made of 8620 steel were processed at the AST production IQ system using a 40 % reduced carburization cycle. An effective case depth in the intensively quenched <b>wear</b> <b>plates</b> was the same as in the standard, oil quenched parts. Base keys provided by an EHT customer and made of 8620 steel were processed using a 40 % reduced carburization cycle. The intensively quenched parts showed the same performance as standard parts. IQT introduced the IQ process in heat treat practices of three commercial heat-treating shops: Akron Steel Treating Co., Summit Heat Treating Co. and Euclid Heat Treating Co. CWRU conducted a material characterization study for a variety of steels to develop a database to support changing/modification of recognized standards for quenching steel parts. IQT conducted a series of IQ workshops, published seven technical papers and participated in ASM Heat Treating Society conference and exposition and in Furnace North America Show. IQT designed and built a fully automated new IQ system installed at the Center for Intensive Quenching. This system includes the following major components: a stand-alone 1, 900 -gallon IQ water system, a 24 '' x 24 '' atmosphere pit furnace, and an automated load transfer mechanism. IQT established a ''Center for Intensive Quenching'' at the AST facilities. The 4, 000 square feet Center includes the following equipment: High-velocity single part quenching IQ unit developed and built previously under EMTEC CT- 65 project. The unit is equipped with a neutral salt bath furnace and a high-temperature, electric-fired, atmosphere, box furnace. New 1, 900 gallon IQ system with a 24 '' x 24 '' atmosphere pit furnace and a load transfer mechanism.

Chromium cast iron wear resistant plates were compared with typically used wear resistant plates made from Hardox 400 steel and two different, wear resistant, materials cladded by welding technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The tests of abrasive wear were conducted in accordance to procedure “A” of standard ASTM G 65 - Standard Test Method for Measuring Abrasion Using the Dry Sand/Rubber Wheel Apparatus.

40|$|The work {{performed}} {{on this program}} was to develop wear resistant, tough FM composite materials with efforts focused on WC-Co based FM systems.

Cross-cutting technologies investigated included hot metal extrusion dies, drill bits for circuit board fabrication, cutting tools for cast iron and aluminum machining. An important part of the work was identification of the standard materials used in drilling applications. A materials trade study to determine those metals and ceramics used for mining applications provided guidance for the most important materials to be investigated. WC-Co and diamond combinations were shown to have the most desirable properties. Other considerations such as fabrication technique and the ability to consolidate shifted the focus away from diamond materials and toward WC-Co. Cooperating partners such as Kennametal and Kyocera assisted with supplies, evaluations of material systems, fabricated parts and suggestions for cross-cutting technology applications for FM architectures. Kennametal provided the raw materials (WC-Co and Al-TiCN powders) for the extent of the material evaluations.

40|$|External {{gear pumps}} {{are the most}} widely {{employed}} source of power in hydraulic applications, allowing good performance and low manufacturing costs. The present paper reports the description of a numerical model for the simulation of these kind of machines, developed by the authors. The model has been implemented using the software AMESim®, introducing new in-house C++ models, with the main aim of an accurate prediction of the pressure ripple at the delivery port and the calculation the flow rate time course through the pump. In fact the reduction of flow pulsations {{is one of the}} crucial targets in the development of these machines. The fluid dynamic model of the pump is based on a finite volumes framework: each chamber presents uniform fluid proprieties and is connected with the adjoining ones by variable orifices. The pump is described by the interaction between a fluid dynamic model, that predicts the instantaneous pressures and the flow rates between the chambers, with a geometrical sub-model for the evaluation of the actual values of the variable volumes (defined by teeth, housing, and side <b>wear</b> <b>plates)</b> and the throat areas, as functions of the shaft angular position. This paper reports a deep description of the fluid dynamic model and a comparison between its numerical results and data available from experiments, showing how a correct evaluation of the flow when the chambers expand (and oil is pushed from the supply tank) or decrease (and oil is ejected into the outlet port) allows a good prediction of the pump characteristics. The results reported in the paper show how the model can be a powerful tool for design and development of external gear pumps, e. g. it easily allows the prediction of the maximum and minimum pressure reached inside the teeth space volumes, giving important information to prevent cavitation and damages as well as to reduce the pump noise. Moreover the simulation environment easily allows the evaluation of the pump behaviour when it works in a given hydraulic system...|$|E
