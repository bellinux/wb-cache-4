25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} {{ideas on the}} roles that workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The Human Factor in <b>Works</b> <b>Management</b> in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E
500|$|Harry Carter (who with George Buday {{made the}} modern {{attribution}} to Kis) wrote that [...] "the letters of Monotype Ehrhardt are {{like those of}} the Janson, but the appearance of a page set in it is different. The Janson is more rotund and has greater contrast of thick and thin." [...] Writing in the 1970s, Carter had misgivings about the condensation, saying that it came close to turning Kis's work into an [...] "accurate drudge" [...] but that [...] "it is a successful type-face". He also suggested that some condensed typefaces made by Kis and sold to the Ducal printing establishment in Florence might have made for a more authentic model. Printing historian James Mosley's review of Morison's memoir, A Tally of Types, described the original metal type as [...] "crudely drawn" [...] compared with some earlier Monotype designs, and suggested that this was due to a change in <b>works</b> <b>management</b> at Monotype with the retirement of head engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010. Effective and {{efficient}} operations management {{is the cornerstone}} of any company's success. Presently, because of cost-cutting pressures, all investors look out for companies' operations before making any investment commitment. The South African Government (through the Department of Public Enterprises), as an owner and investor in Eskom, is looking at optimising operational excellence within state-owned enterprises like Eskom. Eskom is presently experiencing problems with increased electricity consumption which it cannot meet due to the limited plant capacity it presently has. These challenges are forcing Eskom to be more efficient and effective in management of the present plant assets (like Matimba Power Station) it presently operates. Matimba Power Station has consistently shown improvement in the areas of plant, financial and operations performance over the last three years. It is presently the standard bearer for the whole Eskom in terms of plant and operational performance. Asset management (through maintenance and management thereof), especially preventative management with in a power utility like Eskom, is a critical factor because supply (generation of electricity) has to meet demand (consumption of electricity) instantaneously as electricity cannot be saved. The planning, scheduling and execution of maintenance (through a <b>work</b> <b>management</b> process) to ensure success of business operations are very critical. An Eskom document titled Routine <b>Work</b> <b>Management</b> Manual emphasised the criticality of preventative management and included a six-step process of <b>work</b> <b>management</b> within the power generation business. The Japanese success in ensuring that operations costs are limited by implementing total productive maintenance (which includes <b>work</b> <b>management)</b> is suggested in the study as a way to go for operational success at Matimba Power Station. Many of the research studies done at Eskom in regard to maintenance were based on and confined to a sampling population of senior staff members like managers, engineers and supervisors. Experience has shown that progress of implementing change (whether in systems or structures) is slow if there was no proactive involvement of all participants and stakeholders, especially employees at lower levels involved in operations. A <b>work</b> <b>management</b> process, {{which is one of the}} pillars of total productive maintenance, was recently implemented at Matimba and is currently experiencing teething problems which are being attended to. Employee involvement in making sure of the success of <b>work</b> <b>management</b> is critical. The study investigates the implementation of <b>work</b> <b>management</b> from the employees' perspective in order to address problems for possible full implementation of total productive maintenance.
