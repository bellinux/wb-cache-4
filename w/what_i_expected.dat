500|$|Depp said {{of working}} with Baron Cohen, when asked what he was like in real life (meaning, not doing one of his {{trademark}} characters), [...] "He's not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> I didn't look at those characters and think, 'This will be the sweetest guy in the world'. He's incredibly nice. A real gentleman, kind of elegant. I was impressed with him. He's kind of today's equivalent of Peter Sellers." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time I told him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
2500|$|On September 22, 2006, {{she told}} reporters that she has no regrets and said [...] "I am having a {{wonderful}} time here. It's been more than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> and I am enjoying every single second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> to do. <b>I</b> {{would like}} to find some good spot. Where {{would be the best}} place for me to locate, do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect.</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> {{you to say}} {{something}} without my prompting you. You {{know that it was}} outrageous for me to talk about your apparition without your leave, and to be the means of its getting into the newspapers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Extreme's guitarist, Nuno Bettencourt, {{has signed}} on to lead the band. Bettencourt {{explained}} that the rehearsals have been [...] "better than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> because she also has the most incredible band, and I get the privilege to add to their wall of sound. It's gonna be fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haye was due {{to fight}} Manuel Charr at Manchester Arena on 29 June 2013. However, the fight was called off because Haye had {{suffered}} an injury. Haye later arranged a fight with Tyson Fury at the same venue on 28 September 2013. However, {{a week before the}} fight, David Haye sustained a cut to the head which required several stitches, so yet again the fight was postponed. It was originally rescheduled for 8 February 2014. However Haye dropped out of the fight on 17 November 2013 after shoulder surgery. Fury meanwhile, believed that Haye was making excuses because he didn't want the fight, with Fury himself saying [...] "I'm absolutely furious but in all honesty this is exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> Everyone knows I was very suspicious when he pulled out the first time and this confirms to me that he's always been afraid of me and never wanted this fight." [...] Aside from training camp expenses, Haye also cost Fury his positions in the world rankings including an IBF final eliminator bout which would have made him mandatory for a shot at the world title. Although doctors advised Haye to retire from boxing, he never officially announced his retirement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Teacher," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{have seen}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> {{to see and}} heard <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> to hear on this night of full moon, but I am guarded and do not fear." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR FOLKS,--I know I {{ought to}} write oftener (just got your last,) and more fully, but I cannot {{overcome}} my repugnance to telling <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am doing or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> {{to do or}} propose to do. Then, <b>what</b> have <b>I</b> left to write about? Manifestly nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may have}} told thee <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> will shortly happen, {{rather than what}} has happened. But Don Camillo keeps me so much upon the water of late, that I do little besides dream, when not at the oar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are wrong}} to mistrust yourself; {{but it is}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> owe to you and not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> from you that I try to express by {{speaking}} of you as an angel. I {{know that you are}} not an angel to yourself. But you are to me." ...|$|R
60|$|DR. FREEMANTLE. Ah! [A silence.] Forgive me--I'm an {{old friend}} of the family. You're not a bit <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. Do you know, you {{are just}} like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> I hope you are {{disposed}} {{to be friends with}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, thank you,' said Cunningham Haze, looking it over. 'Ah--I {{perceive}} {{it is not}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> to see. Mr. Somerset was mistaken.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, ay,' {{said the}} old lady; 'but don't be soft-hearted and weak, Mary. It is not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> of you, as a {{sensible}} woman, to be harbouring a mere vagrant whom you know nothing about, and injuring your own children.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the truest}} word {{you have said}} for many a day, sir-- rubbish. That's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> they are. Nearly eighty good gold sovereigns gone; a {{perfectly}} clean sweep of your drawer, sir. Bless me if I understand!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Hepzibah, ma'am," [...] said he once, {{after they}} had all been cheerful together, [...] "I really enjoy these quiet little {{meetings}} of a Sabbath afternoon. They are very much like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> to have after I retire to my farm!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> to do; but {{the office}} hasn't made any money. All that I've saved {{is in my}} colt and cutter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For one thing, he's straight--straight as a plumb-line, which isn't {{altogether}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> Then, {{for a man}} {{engaged in}} business, he's a type that's new to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} looking forward to seeing you for days, and now I feel that this is not quite <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> You have changed," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|Appleby smiled gravely. “I think I grasp your meaning, {{but if you}} try {{to follow}} up any clue I may have given you it can only lead you into a pitfall. Please wait, and I think I can engage that Tony will tell you the whole story. It would come best from himself, but he must {{substantiate}} it, and that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>I</b> can enable him to do.” ...|$|R
60|$|The reply being exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>expected,</b> <b>I</b> {{was not in}} {{the least}} disappointed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect,</b> Macumazahn, but <b>I</b> do know that never while I live will I be parted from the lady Heddana. At last I have found some one to love, and {{you and the other}} would steal her away from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, oh dear," [...] said poor Grandma. [...] "This is just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> They've {{never got}} Cyrus's telegram. Well, I {{might have known}} it. What shall I do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then the Duke blazed out, {{which was}} very much <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> from him. Horror, amazement, and scornful disbelief were all {{expressed}} in his transfigured face and angry words.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have it" [...] {{said his}} friend earnestly. [...] "Thank 'ee. That's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> Grummidge. Now what I {{want to know}} is, d'ye think God will forgive me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should. My first duty {{would be}} to my parish and to my school. If I could befriend him {{otherwise}} I would do so;--and that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> from Dr. Wortle. We shall have to go, and I shall be forced to approve of our dismissal." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nasmyth {{laughed as}} {{he glanced at}} the flaring lamp above his head. [...] "There's a hole with a stick in it just at your elbow. I've been filling the holes as we made them. In view of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> those folks in the city are arranging, it seemed advisable." ...|$|R
5000|$|My {{works are}} {{collected}} {{messages from the}} soul, and transferred in image to represent an inside world. I pick up feelings and intuitions to reverse them to the exterior, trying to launch a call in this world. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> is a definitive inside awakening of whom picks up the call... (Massimo Taccon) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Jimmy, with {{a little}} indrawing of his breath. [...] "Still, it is only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> and I suppose I must face it. You are quite sure about that shock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There now!" [...] {{he said in}} tearless despair. [...] "That's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> I did s'pose if I couldn't go you would, {{and tell}} me about it. You're mean as mean can be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{thank you}} very much for everything, Mr. John Strangewey," [...] she returned. [...] "You have given me what we are all sighing for, a new sensation--not exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected,</b> perhaps, but {{something}} new." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course he}} has effaced {{himself with a}} new name and a disguise. This means that I may have to search the whole globe to find him. Indeed it is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect.</b> Do you see, mother? It is I that am the Wandering Jew. The irony of it! We {{arranged}} that for another.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect,</b> you know," [...] said Mr. Brooke, not {{wishing to}} betray how little he enjoyed this prophetic sketch--"what <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> as an {{independent}} man. As to the Whigs, a man who goes with the thinkers {{is not likely to}} be hooked on by any party. He may go with them up to a certain point--up to a certain point, you know. But that is what you ladies never understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I do say that, father. When even Captain Hampton {{was willing}} {{enough to believe}} me guilty, <b>what</b> can <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> from others?' ...|$|R
