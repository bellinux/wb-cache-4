5|$|Phallus calongei was {{discovered}} on June 16, 2008, near the Khanspur stream in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly {{known as the}} North Western Frontier Province) in Pakistan. It was described as new to science in a 2009 Mycotaxon publication. The specific epithet calongei honors Spanish mycologist Francisco D. Calonge <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> on the Gasteromycetes, and who has himself published or co-published three Phallus species: P.atrovolvatus (Kreisel & Calonge), P.maderensis (Calonge) and P.minusculus (Kreisel & Calonge). P.calongei {{is one of four}} Phallus species known to exist in Pakistan, the others being P.celebicus, P.impudicus, and P.rubicundus.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E

[...] "If a woman spends all her time worrying about whether she is normal, or has a G spot or not, she will focus on just one area, and ignore everything else. It's telling people that there is a single, best way to have sex, which isn't the right thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|The brickwall {{mastering}} technique utilised {{during the}} recording of the album has led to some journalists claiming that it was responsible for initiating the loudness war, as its heavy use of compression, first widely used by Morris on Definitely Maybe, was leaps and bounds beyond what any other album up until then had attempted. Music journalist Nick Southall, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> on the loudness war, commented, [...] "If there's a jump-the-shark moment as far as CD mastering goes then it's probably Oasis." [...] In Britpop and the English Music Tradition Andy Bennet and John Stratton noted {{that as a result}} of this technique [...] "the songs were especially loud.

500|$|In 1751, {{with his}} {{large volume of}} prints, Boydell moved to larger {{premises}} at 90 Cheapside. By 1755, he had published A Collection of One Hundred and Two Views, [...] in England and Wales. [...] This cheap but successful book gave him capital to invest. He became increasingly immersed in the commercial side of the print business and like most print dealers began importing prints to sell. [...] These included print reproductions of landscapes by artists such as Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa. The bulk of the imports came from the undisputed masters of engraving during the 18th century: the French. Boydell made a small fortune in the 1750s from these imported prints. His early success was acknowledged in 1760 when he was named {{a member of the}} Royal Society. Winifred Friedman, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> on Boydell, explains that despite this success, [...] "hat rankled Boydell was that the French would not extend credit, or exchange prints; he was required to produce hard cash.

25|$|Few {{figures in}} 20th century Ireland were as {{controversial}} as Noël Browne. To his supporters {{he was a}} dynamic liberal who stood up to conservative and reactionary Catholicism.

Browne further alienated the middle ground in 1986 with the publishing of his autobiography Against the Tide. Historians like Dr. Ruth Barrington, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> about Irish health policy and had access to the files from the 1940s and 1950s, questioned the book's reliability.|$|R

Most of his other churches are closer to the city, in New York, Ossining or Long Island. His church in rural Red Hook is not any different from his urban churches of the period.

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Royal Serbian Army had only three planes, {{one of which was}} piloted by Tomić. His plane was quite primitive even for 1914. Misha Glenny, a journalist <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> on the Balkans, likens it to [...] "a box kite on perambulator wheels". At the beginning of the war, Tomić was attached to the 1st Danube Division. On the afternoon of 12 August 1914, he flew a reconnaissance mission over Šabac, and disclosed to the Serbian High Command that, contrary to initial reports, the Austro-Hungarians had not set up pontoon bridges on the Sava and were attempting to cross the river with boats. On 15 August, Tomić encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian aviator initially waved at Tomić, who waved back. The enemy pilot then took a revolver and began shooting at Tomić's plane. Tomić produced a pistol of his own and fired back. He swerved away from the Austro-Hungarian plane and the two aircraft eventually parted ways. This incident is considered the first recorded dogfight of the war. Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed. The Serbians equipped their planes with [...] Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 machine guns, six 100-round boxes of ammunition and several bombs. The first armed Serbian plane was given the name OЛУЈ (Oluj), or [...] "storm". It was mostly flown by Tomić.|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of Manning's works is the British empire in decline. Her fiction {{contrasts}} deterministic, imperialistic views of history with one that accepts {{the possibility of}} change for those displaced by colonialism. Manning's works take a strong stance against British imperialism, and are harshly critical of racism, anti-Semitism and oppression {{at the end of}} the British colonial era. [...] "British imperialism is shown to be a corrupt and self-serving system, which not only deserves to be dismantled but which is actually on the verge of being dismantled", writes Steinberg. The British characters in Manning's novels almost all assume the legitimacy of British superiority and imperialism and struggle with their position as oppressors who are unwelcome in countries they have been brought up to believe welcome their colonising influence. In this view, Harriet's character, marginalised as an exile and a woman, is both oppressor and oppressed, while characters such as Guy, Prince Yakimov and Sophie seek to exert various forms of power and authority over others, reflecting in microcosm the national conflicts and imperialism of the British Empire. Phyllis Lassner, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> on Manning's writing from a colonial and post-colonial perspective, notes how even sympathetic characters are not excused their complicity as colonisers; the responses of the Pringles assert [...] "the vexed relationship between their own status as colonial exiles and that of the colonised" [...] and native Egyptians, though given very little direct voice in The Levant Trilogy, nevertheless assert subjectivity for their country.|$|E
500|$|John L. Flynn, a Towson University English {{professor}} <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>written</b> <b>extensively</b> about science-fiction film, unfavorably compared Night of the Blood Beast to The Creeping Terror (1964), {{which was}} also about an astronaut returning from space with a stowaway alien creature. Although Flynn said it lacked the [...] "epic pretentiousness" [...] of that film, he nevertheless said of Blood Beast: [...] "Corman {{made a career out}} of making cheap knock-offs of popular films, but he seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel here". The Washington Post writer Tom Shales said [...] "it would be hard to find a worse movie" [...] and that the monster [...] "looks like the San Diego Chicken after having been tarred and feathered". Film critic and historian Steven H. Scheuer said the plot was a good idea but criticized what he called a [...] "sloppy execution". Literary and film critic John Kenneth Muir said he considered the film a failure because the monster [...] "simply could not live up to expectations once revealed". Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars with the entry: [...] "Well directed, but too low budget to succeed." [...] Night of the Blood Beast was among several films universally considered terrible that film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed it on a B movie level, calling it [...] "cheap but enjoyable and buoyed by its ideas". John Stanley, who hosted the San Francisco television show Creature Features about science-fiction films, said Night of the Blood Beast deliberately imitated the best scenes from The Thing from Another World. Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the alien in the film [...] "looks like a human-sized parrot covered in feces" [...] and ranked it as the fifth worst movie monster of all time. However, he said that the film's idea of an alien impregnating a human being was an [...] "interesting concept," [...] noting that it was reused in Ridley Scott's Alien.|$|E
