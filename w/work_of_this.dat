5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen's {{music was}} {{by this time}} championed by, among others, Pierre Boulez, who {{programmed}} first performances at his Domaine musical concerts and the Donaueschingen festival. Works performed included Réveil des oiseaux, Chronochromie (commissioned for the 1960 festival) and Couleurs de la cité céleste. The latter piece {{was the result of}} a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone, xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones. Another <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum, was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the Sainte-Chapelle, then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E

5|$|The third {{important}} <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{period is}} the Virgin of the Rocks, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, {{to be done}} {{with the assistance of the}} de Predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece. Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant John the Baptist, in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water. While the painting is quite large, about , it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of St Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.|$|E

25|$|After the {{publication}} of Rabbit at Rest, Updike {{spent the rest of}} the 1990s and early 2000s publishing novels in a wide range of genres; the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period was frequently experimental in nature. These styles included the historical fiction of Memories of the Ford Administration (1992), the magical realism of Brazil (1994), the science fiction of Toward the End of Time (1997), the postmodernism of Gertrude and Claudius (2000), and the experimental fiction of Seek My Face (2002).|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Palestinians focused on {{investigating}} Palestinian folklore and customs. In 1920, the Palestine Oriental Society was founded by, most prominently among them Tawfiq Canaan. The <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> society was more ethnographic and anthropological than archaeological. Interest in archaeological fieldwork increased as West Bank universities {{emerged in the}} 1980s and cultivated {{a new approach to}} Palestinian archaeology. A new generation of Palestinians, like Albert Glock, introduced innovations to the field by studying Islamic and Ottoman period ruins in village contexts.|$|E

Salihar remained as the main vocalist though Chindlund would perform the lead vocals on certain songs.
