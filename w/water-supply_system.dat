The company built five groups of water towers, thirty-one towers total, designed by its chief architect Sune Lindström, called [...] "the mushroom towers". For a sixth site, the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed, wanted a more spectacular design. This last group, known as Kuwait Towers, consists of three towers, two of which also serve as water towers. Water from the desalination facility is pumped up to the tower. The thirty-three towers have a standard capacity of 102,000 cubic meters of water. [...] "The Water Towers" [...] (Kuwait Tower and the Kuwait Water Towers) were awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (1980 Cycle).|$|E

40|$|Many {{municipal}} <b>water-supply</b> <b>systems</b> in the United States face {{serious problems}} associated with capital deterioration, deferred maintenance, unreliable water supply, and underpricing of services. In addition, local governments are projected to fall $ 17 billion short of the estimated $ 49 billion cost (1993 – 2000) {{to comply with the}} Safe Water Drinking Act amendments. Because municipal <b>water-supply</b> <b>systems,</b> frequently publicly owned and operated, face little capital-market competition and generally cannot go bankrupt, they lack incentives to operate efficiently. Private systems also face operational and management problems as a result of rate-of-return regulation and unequal tax treatment with publicly owned systems. Rate regulation removes incentives to innovate and adopt least-cost practices. In addition, in contrast to municipally owned systems, privately owned systems pay taxes, do not have wide access to tax-exempt funds, and thus operate at a considerable competitive disadvantage. Privatization in the form of long-term, competitive-franchise agreements or asset sales, introduces elements of competition that can generate incentives for efficien...|$|R

One contaminant that is of concern is naturally occurring arsenic. The arsenic leaches from oxidized pyrite.

The new standard is 10 ppb. <b>Water-supply</b> <b>systems</b> must comply with the new standard from January 23, 2006 (EPA, 2004).

These stations were known as refuges for the missionaries and indicative that their work had been of some assistance and importance to the people in Africa.

40|$|Planned {{construction}} {{of more than}} 30 dams, lake-reservoirs and regional <b>water-supply</b> <b>systems,</b> are the basis of long-term water-supply strategy of the Republic of Serbia. The strategy was adopted in the 1970 s and some experiences so far indicate the necessity of revision and rationalization, because of the following: - Quantity and effects of realized works are far lower than planned. The main reasons {{is the lack of}} finance as well as some systemic weaknesses shown in the processes of construction and management of the water systems. - Forecasted demographic growth as well as water consumption rates, dating back to 1970 s- 80 s, are significantly oversized. -Global and domestic experiences in the field of construction and management of artificial lake- reservoirs indicate numerous techno-economic and environmental risks and negative consequences. - So far results of hydrogeological researches and groundwater capturing in Serbia show that this resource is a very good basis for municipal water-supply in the most part of the territory. - Water pipe lines are, on average, in very poor condition. Water supply deficits are recorded frequently because of enormous losses in distribution. The rationalization means an approach suited to the real water-supply need {{as well as to the}} financial and organizational capabilities. Orientation to the available groundwater resources is the basic guideline. One of the priorities is repairing of water pipe networks. This approach allows: - Much faster solving of water-supply problems - Big financial savings in the {{construction of}} dams, reservoirs, regional pipelines, raw water treatment plants as well as in the space adaptation and maintenance of regional <b>water-supply</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The public {{standpipe}} is the user interface of most rural water systems in South Africa.

Statewide, there are about 710 community public drinking-water systems, of which about 690 use groundwater as their only water source. These groundwater systems serve more than 870,000 residents. Additionally, there are about 35 facilities defined by the SDWA as noncommunity, nontransient public water systems that rely on groundwater.
