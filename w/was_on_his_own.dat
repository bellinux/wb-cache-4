5|$|On 14 January 1892, {{six weeks}} after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of pneumonia, leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just {{recovered}} from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with typhoid fever, the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert. Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May as a suitable match for her grandson, and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning. A year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. Throughout their lives, they remained devoted to each other. George <b>was,</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> admission, unable to express his feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.|$|E
25|$|Elder {{was born}} in 1952, the second of Randolph and Viola Conley Elder's three sons. At the time, the family lived in the largely Latino Pico-Union {{district}} of Los Angeles. Elder's father, Randolph, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{from the age of}} 13 and worked a variety of jobs. He enlisted in the US Marines and served as a cook in the Philippines during World War II. Following the war, he was refused employment as a short-order cook many times because he had no references.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lee, {{who was in}} {{his private}} cabin {{at the time of}} the incident, {{immediately}} rushed to the bridge. After a short period, all the ship's mates and helmsmen arrived there as well. Around this time, the chief engineer stopped the engines, although it is unknown whether it <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> volition or following an order from Captain Lee. At 8:50, the chief engineer ordered an evacuation of the engine room through a call to the assistant engineer. During this time, Park was crying, as she was taken aback by the sudden incident; this lasted until at least 9:06a.m.|$|E

25|$|After the divorce, Vedder {{learned the}} truth about his parentage: Mueller was really his stepfather. Vedder had met his {{biological}} father briefly as a child, but had believed that Severson was merely {{an old friend of}} his parents. By the time Vedder learned the truth, Severson had died of multiple sclerosis. By his senior year at San Dieguito High School, Vedder <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> living in an apartment and supporting himself with a nightly job at a drug store in Encinitas. He eventually {{dropped out of high school}} in his senior year due to the pressures of balancing school with working. He joined the rest of his family in Chicago, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Eddie Vedder, Vedder being his mother's maiden name.|$|E
25|$|In late 1905, Harry {{left the}} trio {{following}} {{an argument with}} Al. Harry had refused Al's request {{to take care of}} Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair, while he was dating. After Harry's departure, Al and Joe Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906 the two agreed to separate, and Jolson <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> Jolson became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in San Francisco, California, and remained successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer. He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the earthquake-devastated people needed someone to cheer them up. In 1908 Jolson, needing money for himself and his new wife, Henrietta, returned to New York. In 1909, Al's singing caught the attention of Lew Dockstader, the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels. Al accepted Dockstader's offer and became a regular blackface performer.|$|E
25|$|While Ambrose and Reigns did {{not fall}} out with each other, they did begin to take {{separate}} paths as Ambrose declared his intentions to take revenge on Rollins, while Reigns {{set his sights on}} the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. While the duo were still referred to as The Shield on the June 13 episode of SmackDown, Ambrose debuted new theme music while no longer wearing The Shield's attire and entering the ring through the traditional entrance on the June 16 episode of Raw, while Reigns largely retained The Shield's ring attire and theme music as well as continuing to enter the ring through the live audience, which indicated that Ambrose and Reigns were now working on their own and that The Shield had quietly disbanded. On the June 24 episode of Main Event, Reigns confirmed that he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> and no longer with The Shield, thus confirming that The Shield had dissolved.|$|E

25|$|For his {{entrance}} {{prior to}} the main event Myzteziz was lowered from the ceiling wearing a harness, holding a pose {{similar to that of}} Ethan Hunt (portrayed by Tom Cruise) from the first Mission Impossible movie. Once he landed on the ground and was unhooked he revealed a half black/half white version of his normal wrestling gear, alluding to comments made {{prior to the}} show that he may or may not work as a tecnico for the match. Initially Rey Mysterio Jr. took control of the match, much to Myzteziz's frustration, with Myzteziz only gaining control of the match by using punches, kicks and other rudo tactics. This drew boos from the crowd as they were vocally behind Rey Mysterio Jr. At one point during the match Myzteziz slammed Rey Mysterio Jr. onto of the English Language commentator's table, and at another point he suplexed Mysterio Jr. out of the ring, through a table. At one point Rey Mysterio Jr. threw Myzteziz into one of the ring posts, making it look like Myzteziz hit his head on the metal. While the cameras were focusing on Rey Mysterio Jr. Myzteziz made it look like the impact had cut his forehead open as blood (or a similar red substance) covered the white portion of his mask. Once the two wrestlers returned to the ring Rey Mysterio Jr. started to tear at Myzteziz's mask, tearing it open around the eye holds. Late in the match Rey Mysterio Jr. managed to apply Myzteziz's finishing hold, the La Mistica Fujiwara armbar, on Myzteziz but did not gain a submission from the move. Later on Mysterio Jr. managed to apply La Mistica once more, this time with Myzteziz being forced to tap out. As Mysterio Jr. celebrated on the floor Averno, Pentag√≥n Jr. and Joe Lider ran to the ring to attack Myzteziz while he was down. When Rey Mysterio Jr. noticed the attack he entered the ring and helped Myzteziz fight off the rudo trios. When Mysterio Jr. offered a handshake Myzteziz spit a liquid in Mysterio's eyes and then declared that he did not care about the fans or Rey Mysterio Jr. He later challenged Mysterio to put his mask on the line in a Luchas de Apuestas match. As the show went off the air Myzteziz declined to join Konnan's La Sociedad, stating he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> train, the Look Ahead, Neighbor, stumping through Missouri, and on {{the morning}} of the 19th, his {{campaign}} staff made him aware of the gathering storm. Eisenhower publicly called upon Nixon to release all documents relating to the Fund, somewhat to the dismay of Chotiner, who wondered, [...] "What more does the general require than the senator's word?" [...] Eisenhower aides contacted the senior Republican senator from California, William Knowland, and persuaded him to fly from Hawaii to join the Eisenhower train and be available as a potential replacement running mate.|$|E

2500|$|Ismail's father {{believed}} {{strongly in}} the benefits of education, unlike many Malays of the time, and ensured his children received the best education possible. Two of his sons became lawyers and another an economist. In 1939, the British General Adviser W.E. Pepys lamented that [...] "the only Johore Malay who has got a university degree is Encik(Mr.) Suleiman bin Abdul Rahman, the son of Dato Abdul Rahman, State Treasurer, Johore." [...] Ismail himself went on to obtain a degree at the King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore. In 1945, {{he became the first}} Malay to obtain a MBBS from University of Melbourne, Australia. Ismail's son later said that his education in Australia greatly impacted his worldview: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> and a member of a minority there. He didn‚Äôt have other Malays to prop him up and he had a sense of loneliness. He felt that he was treated as an equal and that this was the way he would want to treat other people as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 Aphex Twin {{released}} Drukqs, {{an experimental}} double album featuring computer-controlled piano (influenced by Erik Satie and John Cage) and abrasive, fast, meticulously-programmed songs. Many track names {{are written in}} Cornish‚Äîfor example, [...] "Jynweythek" [...] ("Machine Music"). Rolling Stone described the piano pieces as [...] "aimlessly pretty". The release polarized reviewers, some believed that Drukqs was released as a contract-breaker with Warp Records, since James' next major release <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Rephlex label. The musician told interviewers he accidentally left an MP3 player {{with a large number}} of new songs (labelled [...] "Aphex Twin‚Äîunreleased tracks") on a plane, and rushed the album's release to preempt an Internet leak. In 2001 James also released a short EP, 2 Remixes By AFX, with remixes of songs by 808 State and DJ Pierre. It also had an untitled third track, consisting of a SSTV image with high-pitched sounds which can be decoded to a viewable image with appropriate software (such as MultiMode for Macintosh or MMSSTV for Windows). In 2002, James was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male.|$|E

60|$|Undy Scott, {{among his}} other good qualities, possessed an {{enormous}} quantity {{of that which}} schoolboys in these days call 'cheek.' He was not easily browbeaten, and was generally prepared to browbeat others.

Could Undy Scott have had Mr. Chaffanbrass down at the clubs, there would have been, perhaps, another tale to tell.|$|E

60|$|John was {{comforted by}} {{seeing in the}} face of his brother the same rapt {{expression}} which he felt <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> He walked along almost mechanically, scarcely feeling the sidewalk, his thoughts still dwelling on the lady and the play. It was after ten o'clock, and the stores were all shut, the frost lay thick and white on the plank walk, and the moon was shining as only a moon can shine through the rarefied air on the Western prairies, and overhead the stars in innumerable hosts swam in the absolutely cloudless sky.|$|E

60|$|Now {{and again}} short, stump, thick-legged figures of Cornish miners passed him, and he {{invariably}} gave them goodnight, {{as if to}} insist that he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> ground.

And as he went along the dreary road, looking now at {{the lights of the}} dwellings on land, now at the lights away to sea, vessels veering round in sight of the Longships Lighthouse, the whole of the Atlantic Ocean in darkness and space between him and America, he seemed a little excited and pleased with himself, watchful, thrilled, veering along in a sense of mastery and of power in conflict.|$|E
