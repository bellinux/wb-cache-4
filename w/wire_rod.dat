40|$|Abstract: Al-Cu-Mg (Russian grade V 65) alloys {{are used}} for {{riveting}} applications in aerospace industries due to their relatively high shear strength {{of the order of}} 25 kg/mm 2 combined with a high plasticity. This paper presents the processing of V 65 aluminium alloy rivets from <b>wire</b> <b>rods.</b> It was observed that <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> which have not been intermittently annealed and having more than 25 % cold working prior to heading operation, cracked on the free bulged surface of the head. In view of this, it is recommended that a maximum of 25 % of cold work is allowed in the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> to be used for rivet fabrication to successfully realize defect free rivets. 1...|$|R
