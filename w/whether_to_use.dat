5|$|Nuclear war, or {{at least}} {{deployed}} nuclear arms, is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels. In Player Piano, the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> high-explosive or nuclear arms. In Cat's Cradle, John's original purpose in setting pen to paper is to write an account of what prominent Americans had been doing as Hiroshima was bombed.|$|E

Besides accreditation issues, officials must resolve <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> local four-year educational institutions or to build a separate site in Summit Township for community college classes.|$|E

On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned London Underground, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it. V meets Party Leader Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, he returns to Evey and tells her he loves her before dying.|$|E

50|$|Like a looper, the all-round {{attacker}} {{uses the}} loop {{as a primary}} weapon. In addition, an equally effective backhand increases the chances of having the first attack, {{and the number of}} angles that could be attacked. While this potentially means that the player could get confused <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> attack <b>using</b> the forehand or backhand, most players tend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the more powerful forehand, making all-round attackers not that different from loopers.|$|R

If Random Garbage Rules is selected, during each game played, either Normal, Point, or Hard Nuisance Puyo will be used.|$|R
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{adaptive}} resource reser-vation protocol for high-speed resource information adver-tisement. The adaptive resource reservation protocol (ARRP) is a protocol that adaptively decides <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>uses</b> a 1 -way reservation scheme or 2 -way reservation scheme {{on the basis}} of resource information in the route calculation. Examples of the resource information are unreserved bandwidth and unreserved wavelength. The 1 -way reservation is used when all links along the calculated route has enough resources. Otherwise, the 2 -way reservation is used. In GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching) network, the source router decides a label switched path (LSP) route using collected resource information from the network. The resource information is advertised by an OSPF-TE (Open Shortest Path First-Traffic Engineering) protocol...|$|R
5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E

There is debate about <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>using</b> catgut in a medical setting, since cotton is usually cheaper and wounds closed with either cotton or synthetic threads are less prone to infection. Catgut sutures remain in use in developing countries where they are locally less expensive and easier to obtain.|$|R

The UA1204 and UA1207 boosters were considered, with the highest total impulse configuration using four UA1207 boosters, capable of placing 146,000 lb of payload into low Earth orbit. Designers considered changing the amount of fuel loaded into the rocket, and <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> ignite the S-II stage on the ground, or <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> launch <b>using</b> the solids, and start the main stage in flight. Two versions omitted the S-IVB stage.|$|R
