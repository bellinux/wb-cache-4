50|$|Reflectors {{are often}} used in the lamps to {{maximize}} light efficiency. Plants or lights are moved as close together as possible so that they receive equal lighting and that all light coming from the lamps fall upon the plants. Maximum efficiency {{can be obtained by}} creating a slightly concave canopy such that the periphery and center of the canopy are both at the optimum distance from the light source. Often, the distance between lamp and plant is in the range of 0.6 m with high pressure sodium lamps, to 10 cm <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>lamps,</b> such as compact, large and high-output fluorescent lamps. With proper cooling any light type can be moved extremely close to plants to combat the inverse square law, but there are reasons to keep some distance from the canopy regardless of heat concerns; excessive light can cause bleaching of the plant material and the total canopy area contacted by light is decreased as the source is moved closer. Maximum efficiency should be obtained by maximizing the average light intensity (measured in PAR watts) per square foot times the number of square feet of plant matter contacted. Some cannabis cultivators cover the walls of their grow-room with some type of reflective material (often Mylar or Visqueen), or alternatively, white paint to maximize efficiency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler poultry {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on artificial lightening. Power consumption costs of artificial lighting systems is the second largest expense related to broiler industry, second only to feed expenses. Therefore, the current study focused to analyze technical and economic feasibility of replacing incandescent lamps already used in aviaries <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>lamp</b> types. Costs related to power consumption, implementation and maintenance of the lighting systems were evaluated {{with the aid of}} financial mathematics using net present value, return over investment and payback. Systems composed of six lamp types were analyzed in two different configurations to meet the minimum illuminance of 5 and 20 lux and for use in conventional sheds and dark house. The lamps tested were incandescent (LI) of 100 W, compact fluorescent (CFL) of 34 W, mixed (ML) 160 W sodium vapor (SVL) of 70 W, tubular fluorescent T 8 (TFL T 8) of 40 W and tubular fluorescent T 5 (TFL T 5) of 28 W.

5000|$|As <b>with</b> <b>other</b> LED <b>lamps</b> {{available}} today, {{the quality}} and color temperature of the white light produced by such lamps varies. Many tend towards the blue end of the spectrum, being even [...] "cooler"-coloured than fluorescent lighting. Because of this variability, some MR16 and MR11 compatible LED lamps will create significantly more natural looking light than others. The least efficient of these lamps produce about 26 lumens per watt (lm/W), {{which is similar to}} the efficacy of halogen MRs. The most efficient of these lamps available today produce about 100 lm/W, which exceeds the efficacy of compact fluorescent lamps.|$|R

40|$|Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLS) and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) {{have risen}} to a great {{popularity}} in recent years due to outstanding features such as longevity and energy-efficient design. These bright, compact lights are usually designed to reduce the energy consumption without sacrificing light or productivity. In fact, manufacturers are now producing CFLs {{that are designed to}} fit into our exiting light fixtures which eases the transition from traditional incandescent bulbs to more energy-efficient alternatives. Fluoroscent Lamps practically emerged in 1934. During the past 80 years this lamp has undergone numerous changes in materials and design to ensure a leading position as the lamp offering the lowest total cost of ownership while producing a high quality white light.

50|$|When a mercury vapor lamp {{is first}} turned on, it {{will produce a}} dark blue glow because {{only a small amount}} of the mercury is ionized and the gas {{pressure}} in the arc tube is very low, so much of the light is produced in the ultraviolet mercury bands. As the main arc strikes and the gas heats up and increases in pressure, the light shifts into the visible range and the high gas pressure causes the mercury emission bands to broaden somewhat, producing a light that appears more nearly white to the human eye, although it is still not a continuous spectrum. Even at full intensity, the light from a mercury vapor lamp with no phosphors is distinctly bluish in color. The pressure in the quartz arc-tube rises to approximately one atmosphere once the bulb has reached its working temperature. If the discharge should be interrupted (e.g. by interruption of the electric supply), it is not possible for the lamp to restrike until the bulb cools enough for the pressure to fall considerably. The reason for a prolonged period of time before the lamp restrikes is because mercury vapor ballasts along <b>with</b> <b>other</b> HID <b>lamp</b> ballasts send relatively low voltage to the lamp upon start up, but as pressure increases inside the arc-tube, higher voltage is required to keep the lamp lit so the ballast sends higher voltage to the lamp. Once the ballast is shut off and turned on again, it starts over at a low voltage but if the lamp is still hot, then high pressure inside the arc-tube prevents the lamp from striking an arc and turning on.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Over {{the last}} decade there has been {{increasing}} concern regarding the presence and possible toxic effects of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment. The studied benzophenones include UV filters, a pharmaceutical, its phototransformation products and others. The aim of this work was {{to gain a better}} understanding of the fate of the selected benzophenones in the aquatic environment under the influence of ultraviolet irradiation. Compounds were exposed to UV irradiation using low pressure (LP) monochromatic mercury lamp with a peak emission at 254 nm and medium pressure (MP) mercury lamp with a pyrex glass filter. Whereas ketoprofen was prone to UV irradiation (it was completely degraded after 15 minutes of irradiation <b>with</b> MP <b>lamp),</b> <b>other</b> compounds were found to be highly resistant. Therefore the efficiency of the UV treatment was increased by combining UV irradiation (LP lamp) and hydrogen peroxide. As a result of adding 0. 1 % hydrogen peroxide, improved removal of 2 -hydroxy- 4 methoxybenzophenone (77 %) and 3 -i-propylbenzophenone (92 %) was achieved...|$|R

50|$|Security {{lighting}} may {{be subject}} to vandalism, possibly to reduce its effectiveness for a subsequent intrusion attempt. Thus security lights should either be mounted very high, or else protected by wire mesh or tough polycarbonate shields. <b>Other</b> <b>lamps</b> may be completely recessed from view and access, with the light directed out through a light pipe or reflected from a polished aluminium or stainless steel mirror. For similar reasons high security installations may provide a stand-by power supply for their security lighting.|$|R
50|$|CDM lamps use one {{fifth of}} the power of {{comparable}} tungsten incandescent light bulbs for the same light output (80-117 lm/W) and retain color stability better than most <b>other</b> gas discharge <b>lamps.</b> Like <b>other</b> high-intensity discharge <b>lamps,</b> they require a correctly rated electrical ballast in order to operate.|$|R
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the <b>other</b> <b>lamp</b> lags the mains phase.|$|R

Asymmetric lamps often cause more reflected glare than <b>other</b> <b>lamps.</b> In workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control (ref:1).|$|R
