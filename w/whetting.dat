2500|$|Until {{the late}} 1980s, {{ordinary}} East Germans were only permitted {{to travel to}} the West on [...] "urgent family business" [...] such as the marriage, serious illness or death of a close relative. In February 1986, the regime relaxed the definition of [...] "urgent family business", though it still required travellers to leave behind [...] "collateral" [...] (in effect, a hostage) such as a spouse, child or other close relative. This massively increased the number of citizens able {{to travel to the}} West. The number of legal East German border-crossers rose from 66,000 in 1985 to 573,000 in 1986, 1.2million in 1987 and 2.2million in 1988. The [...] "pensioner traffic" [...] increased greatly as well, from 1.6million a year in 1985 to 3.8million in 1987. According to East German official figures, more than 99.5% of the border-crossers returned home. The relaxation of the border restrictions was said to have been motivated by a desire {{on the part of the}} East German leadership to reduce their citizens' desire to travel and shrink the number applying to emigrate. In practice, however, it had exactly the opposite effect. A Washington Post article of April 1988 wondered prophetically whether the policy would lead to East Germany [...] "fac the prospect that the freer travel policy could be destabilizing by <b>whetting</b> desires for additional liberties." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the royal Norwegian {{monopoly}} on shipping contributed to the end of trade and contact. However, Christianity and European customs continued to hold sway among the Greenlanders for the greater part of the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1921, a Danish historian, Paul Norland, found human remains from the Eastern Settlement in the Herjolfsnes church courtyard. The bodies were dressed in 15th century medieval clothing with no indications of malnutrition or inbreeding. Most had crucifixes around their necks with their arms crossed as in a stance of prayer. Roman papal records report that the Greenlanders were excused from paying their tithes in 1345 because the colony was suffering from poverty. The last reported ship to reach Greenland was a private ship that was [...] "blown off course", reaching Greenland in 1406, and departing in 1410 with the last news of Greenland: the burning at the stake of a condemned witch, the insanity and death of the woman this witch was accused of attempting to seduce through witchcraft, and the marriage of the ship's captain, Thorsteinn Ólafsson, to another Icelander, Sigridur Björnsdóttir. However, there are some suggestions of much later unreported voyages from Europe to Greenland, possibly as late as the 1480s. In the mid-1500s, a German ship drifted off-course to Greenland and, coming ashore a small island, discovered the body of a dead man lying face down who demonstrated cultural traits of both Norse and Inuit. An Icelandic crew member of the ship wrote: [...] "He had a hood on his head, well sewn, and clothes from both homespun and sealskin. At his side lay a carving knife bent and worn down by <b>whetting.</b> This knife they took with them for display." ...|$|E
