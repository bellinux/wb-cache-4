2500|$|Mullen, who had mostly been {{absent from}} the {{sessions}} {{to start a family}} and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November 1995. Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting as a group but also allowing them to pursue different musical influences. Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording. Eno attempted to convince the other band members to wait for Mullen, but as the Edge explains, [...] "The thinking was that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>further</b> experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, 'Let's just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.'" [...] Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from fully dedicating himself to recording. As he described, [...] "I needed a little more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, I had {{to put a lot of}} time in." [...] Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.|$|E
5000|$|In 1803, the United States {{purchased}} the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon for $11,000,000. The territory included {{most of the}} western half of the Mississippi watershed and covered nearly all of present-day South Dakota, except for a small portion in {{the northeast corner of}} the state. The region was still largely unexplored and unsettled, and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly referred to as the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the newly acquired region over a period of more than two years. The expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery, was tasked with following the route of the Missouri to its source, continuing on to the Pacific Ocean, establishing diplomatic relations with the various tribes in the area, and taking cartographic, geologic, and botanical surveys of the area. The expedition left St. Louis on May 14, 1804 with 45 men and 15 tons of supplies in three boats (one keelboat and two pirogues). The party progressed slowly against the Missouri's current, reaching what is today South Dakota on August 22. Near present-day Vermillion, the party hiked to the Spirit Mound after hearing local legends of the place being inhabited by [...] "little spirits" [...] (or [...] "devils"). Shortly after this, a peaceful meeting took place with the Yankton Sioux, while an encounter with the Lakota Sioux further north was not as uneventful. The Lakota mistook the party as traders, at one point stealing a horse. Weapons were brandished on both sides after it appeared as though the Lakota <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>further</b> delay or even halt the expedition, but they eventually stood down and allowed the party to continue up the river and out of their territory. In north central South Dakota, the expedition acted as mediators between the warring Arikara and Mandan. After leaving the state on October 14, the party wintered with the Mandan in North Dakota before successfully reaching the Pacific Ocean and returning by the same route, safely reaching St. Louis in 1806. On the return trip, the expedition spent only 15 days in South Dakota, traveling more swiftly with the Missouri's current.|$|E

30|$|We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>further</b> {{study the}} {{generalized}} ADMM. Note {{that the first}} sub-problem in the generalized ADMM is irrelevant to the relaxation factor α. That is, the updating formula for x_ 1 does not incorporate the relaxation factor α explicitly. Furthermore, α∈(1, 2) is often advantageous for the generalized ADMM [14]. Therefore, in this paper, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> propose a new generalized ADMM, whose both sub-problems incorporate the relaxation factor α directly. The new method generalizes the method proposed in [29] by relaxing the feasible set of α from the interval [1, 2) to the infinite interval [1,+∞), and {{can be viewed as}} a symmetric version of the generalized ADMM.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—On-chip {{interconnection}} networks {{consume a}} significant {{fraction of the}} chip’s power, and the rapidly increasing core counts in future technologies <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>further</b> aggravate {{their impact on the}} chip’s overall power consumption. A large fraction of the traffic originates not from data messages exchanged between sharing cores, but from the communication between the cores and intermediate hardware structures (i. e., directories) for the purpose of maintaining coherence in the presence of conflicting updates. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Directories, a method allowing the directories to be placed arbitrarily in the chip by piggy-backing the virtual to physical address translation. This eliminates a large fraction of the on-chip interconnect traversals, hence reducing the power consumption. Through trace-driven and cycle-accurate simulation in a range of scientific and Map-Reduce applications, we show that our technique reduces the power and energy expended by the on-chip interconnect by up to 37 % (16. 4 % on average) with negligible hardware overhead and a small improvement in performance (1. 3 % on average). 21 Keywords-On-chip networks; Non-uniform caches; Multicore architectur...|$|R

Approximately ninety per cent of their production is exported. Apart from the neighbouring countries, which are traditional customers, Czech poppy is starting to penetrate the markets in the Russian Federation, the United States, the Scandinavian countries etc. The transformation of the centrally-planned economy within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (MEA) to a market system without more significant international integration links forced the Czechoslovak Federative Republic and then the Czech Republic to change the structure of its agricultural sector.
