25|$|Creep {{can cause}} gradual {{cut-through}} of <b>wire</b> <b>insulation,</b> especially when stress is concentrated by pressing insulated wire against a sharp edge or corner. Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (polyvinylidene fluoride) {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist cut-through due to the sharp corners of wire wrap terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow cut-through failures caused by creep.|$|E

40|$|Polymers {{have been}} widely used as <b>wiring</b> {{electrical}} <b>insulation</b> materials in space/air-craft. The dielectric properties of insulation polymers can change over time, however, due to various aging processes such as exposure to heat, humidity and mechanical stress. Therefore, the study of polymers used in electrical <b>insulation</b> of <b>wiring</b> is important to the aerospace industry due to potential loss of life and aircraft {{in the event of an}} electrical fire caused by breakdown of <b>wiring</b> <b>insulation.</b> Part of this research is focused on studying the mechanisms of various environmental aging process of the polymers used in electrical <b>wiring</b> <b>insulation</b> and the ways in which their dielectric properties change as the material is subject to the aging processes. The other part of the project is to determine the feasibility of a new capacitive nondestructive testing method to indicate degradation in the <b>wiring</b> <b>insulation,</b> by measuring its permittivity...|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} devices unintentional short circuits are usually caused when a <b>wire's</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks down, or when another conducting material is introduced, allowing charge to flow along {{a different path}} than the one intended.|$|R
25|$|When <b>wire</b> <b>insulation</b> disintegrates, it {{can result}} in an {{unintended}} electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple {{is used in the}} closed loop control of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically outgas, which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.|$|E
25|$|Power {{handling}} {{is related}} to the heat resistance of the <b>wire</b> <b>insulation,</b> adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the voice coil windings is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100mm diameter voice coil, with a 12mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50mm diameter voice coil with a 24mm winding height.|$|E

5000|$|After the accident, a {{thorough}} investigation of wiring systems in various ELV families was undertaken, which discovered that, among other things, the Delta had thinner <b>wiring</b> <b>insulation</b> than Titan, Atlas, and other launch vehicles.

50|$|An arc {{fault is}} a high power {{discharge}} of electricity between two or more conductors.

50|$|Plenum-rated and riser-rated cables are {{restricted}} to only allow certain chemicals for manufacture of the <b>wire</b> <b>insulation</b> and cable sheath.

40|$|Abstract: Spacecraft, and {{especially}} aircraft, often fly well past their original design lives and, therefore, {{the need to}} develop nondestructive evaluation procedures for inspection of vital structures in these craft is extremely important. One of the more recent problems is the degradation of <b>wiring</b> and <b>wiring</b> <b>insulation.</b> This paper describes three nondestructive characterization methods which afford the possibility to detect <b>wiring</b> and <b>insulation</b> degradation in-situ prior to major problems with the safety of aircraft and spacecraft Introduction: Civilian and military aircraft, as well as spacecraft, often fly well past their original design lives. A major problem that ensues is the aging of the wiring and associated electrical components. Destructive testing of the wiring systems is both highly expensive and labor intensive since it involves removing the wiring from the craft, determining the serviceability, and then either reinstalling or replacing with new wiring. It is essential that a les...|$|R

He retired from GE in June 1988, but continued his polymer research until his death in February 1989.|$|E
5000|$|A punch-down block (also punchdown block, punch block, punchblock, quick-connect {{block and}} other variations) {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} connection often used in telephony. It is named because the solid copper wires are [...] "punched down" [...] into short open-ended slots which are a type of insulation-displacement connectors. These slots, usually cut crosswise (not lengthwise) across an insulating plastic bar, contain two sharp metal blades which cut through the <b>wire's</b> <b>insulation</b> as it is punched down. These blades hold the wire in position and make the electrical contact with the wire as well.|$|R
30|$|Most {{observations}} for <b>wiring</b> <b>insulation</b> had complete inactivation of spores {{and could}} not be modeled using RSM. All runs from Table  1 had complete inactivation except for runs two, three, nine, and twelve. The notable thing about these four points is that they all had two or more predictors at the low setting; i.e., at least two of x 1, x 2, or x 3 were equal to − 1 for these four observations. This might be considered as the “back corner” of the predictor space. Excepting these four points, the model would be Ŷ[*]=[*]∞ or, equivalently, prob(inactivation)[*]=[*] 1.|$|R
50|$|A {{high current}} flowing through a battery {{can cause a}} rapid {{increase}} of temperature, potentially resulting in an explosion {{with the release of}} hydrogen gas and electrolyte (an acid or a base), which can burn tissue and cause blindness or even death. Overloaded wires will also overheat causing damage to the <b>wire's</b> <b>insulation,</b> or starting a fire. High current conditions may also occur with electric motor loads under stalled conditions, such as when the impeller of an electrically driven pump is jammed by debris; this is not a short, though it may have some similar effects.|$|R
