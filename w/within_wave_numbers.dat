The dissipation is proportional to the second derivative of the velocity. The applied equation is made non-dimensional by selecting a length scale from which the time scale and the velocity scale may be determined. The resulting equation contains no parameters apart from the forcing. The integrations use a large number of spectral components and no approximation is made with respect to the non-linear interaction among the spectral components. Starting from an initial state in which all the velocity components are set to zero the equation is integrated for a long time to see if it reaches a steady state. The spectral distribution of the kinetic energy is determined in the steady state, and it is found that the distribution, in agreement with observational studies, may be approximated by a power law of the form n - 3 <b>within</b> certain <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> regions. The <b>wave</b> <b>numbers</b> for which the - 3 power law applies is found between the region of maximum forcing and the dissipation range.

The predicted towed electrode GEK signal is determined to second-order for long-crested internal waves in a finite but deep ocean. The analysis includes the determination of GEK signatures for small amplitude and finite amplitude interfacial waves along shallow thermoclines. In addition, the GEK response to internal waves existent in a continuously stratified fluid is discussed along with a particular application of the GEK theory to internal waves in a sea possessing a density profile of the form p₀ = p₀ (0) (1 -μz). The validity of the theory is restricted to <b>waves</b> <b>within</b> the <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> range k = 10 ⁻⁴ m⁻¹ to k = 10 m⁻¹ due to {{the assumption that the}} electric currents associated with time variations in the induced magnetic field be negligible. The results indicate that internal waves of reasonable amplitude would produce a detectable signal at mid and high latitudes, but would be undetectable at low latitudes. The vertical component of the Earth's magnetic field, Hz, and the wave amplitude are shown to have the dominant effect in determining the magnitude of the GEK signal. For fixed latitude and <b>wave</b> <b>number,</b> the interfacial <b>wave</b> GEK signal increases as the depth of the thermocline decreases. Similarly for fixed latitude and thermocline depth, the signal increases as the <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> k decreases. As the density difference across the thermocline increases, the GEK response will increase. Corresponding relationships exist for continuous density internal wave GEK values but are found to be less influential. Finally, internal standing waves are shown to produce no detectable signal voltages. A discussion of experimental precautions necessary in the GEK monitoring of internal waves is also included...|$|R

Also, for wave propagation {{in the direction}} of symmetry, some wave types revert to pure modes, leading to a simpler characteristic equation of lower order. A consequence of thermoelastic anisotropy in media is the loss of pure wave modes for general propagation direction. At low <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> limits, modes are found to highly influence and they vary with the thermal relaxation times. At relatively low values of the <b>wave</b> <b>number,</b> little change is seen in these values. As the <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> increases, other high modes appear; one of the modes seems to be associated with quick change in the slope of the mode.
