40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{isotropic}} {{materials with}} a significant fraction of micro-pores, the cumulative water intake per unit of inflow surface area typically yields a linear function of the square root of time elapse. The authors postulate that this dependence has a limited range of validity. The validity of this approximation starts from an initial period that is inversely proportional to the rate of water intake and ends much before the material reaches the capillary moisture content. Experimental investigation presented here uses a differential presentation of the cumulative water inflow and clearly indicates that material such as calcium silicate or brick belong to a broad class of materials characterized by a constant water absorption coefficient (A-coefficient). Initial period varies from 12 to 4 minutes. On the other hand, materials with a multiple pore-system such as an Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) may display a systematically varying A-coefficient. Authors propose a test procedure limited to 1 -hour duration {{that can be used}} to derive a practical and reproducible value of A-coefficient.

40|$|Background: The neuropeptide galanin {{increases}} food intake. Chronic ethanol (EtOH) {{increases the}} expression of galanin in the hypothalamus. The research presented here examines the effects of microinjection of galanin in the third ventricle on voluntary alcohol intake. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats with a cannula in the third ventricle were given access to increasing concentrations of EtOH for 12 hr/day until all acquired a preference for 7 % EtOH over water in a two-bottle choice. Rats then received a microinjection of galanin (0, 1, and 3 nmol) alone or {{in combination with the}} galanin antagonist M 40 (1 nmol) and with M 40 alone to determine the effects on EtOH and <b>water</b> <b>intake.</b> <b>Tests</b> were conducted during both the light and dark periods of a 12 : 12 -hr light-dark cycle with food available ad libitum. As a control for galanin-induced calorie intake, both EtOH and food were measured in a subset of rats during the dark. Results: Microinjections of galanin (1. 0 and 3. 0 nmol) increased EtOH consumption during both periods of the light-dark cycle. Galanin’s effect on ethanol intake during the light was large relative to the very low intake of food and water during this period. Rats increased their intake of EtOH but not food. Receptor specificity for galanin (3 nmol) was shown by the galanin antagonist M 40, which blocked the increase in EtOH intake. M 40 alone decreased EtOH intake slightly. Conclusions: These data show that galanin injected in the third ventricle increases EtOH consumption and that the effect can occur during both the light and the dark periods of the diurnal cycle in the presence of food and water. This suggests that galanin {{may play a role in}} augmenting voluntary alcohol intake and perhaps the development of alcohol dependence...|$|R
40|$|Drinking {{response}} to hypertonio saline, a cellular thirst stimulus, and to isoproterenol, probably an extracellular thirst stimulus, was normal in rats with bilateral lesions in the basolateral {{region of the}} amygdala. The overnight <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> of the lesioned rats was a little higher than normal. However, the lesioned rats showed a major impairment in learning to avoid ingesting a poisonous solution of LiCl when they were thirsty. The lesioned rats also showed an increased preference of 25 % sucrose in a two-bottle sucrose-water test. The main conclusion is that the basolateral region of the amygdala {{is involved in the}} effects of previous experience on drinking and not primarily in the cellular or extracellular controls of drinking. In the preceding article (Rolls & Rolls, 1973) it is shown that the basolateral region of the amygdala is involved in food selection. It does not appear {{to play a major role}} in the amount of food eaten. In this article, the role of the amygdala in the regulation of fluid intake is considered. It has previously been shown that amygdaloid neurons are directly excited in stimulus-bound drinking and eating and have the same refractory periods as the neurons involved in the drinking and eating (Rolls, 1972, 1973). Lesions in the amygdala can lead to increased or decreased <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> (Grossman & Grossman, 1963). It is not possible to determine whether there was a specific deficit in the regulation of <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> because <b>tests</b> for osmotic regulation (Fitzsimons, 1961 a) and extracellular regulation (Fitzsimons, 1961 b; Strieker, 1966) of <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> were not reported. Injections of carbachol into the amygdala do not induce <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> but can modulate drinking induced by water deprivation (Grossman, 1964).

40|$|Central {{angiotensin}} II (AngII) stimulates {{water and}} salt solution intake. Pretreatment with low-dose mineralocorticoid (DOCA) enhances this AngII-induced intake of salt solutions (the synergy theory) in Wistar and Sprague Dawley rats {{but not in}} Fischer rats. This response is mediated via the AT- 1 receptor. Electrophysiological experiments using iontophoretic application of AngII and the AT- 1 receptor-specific non-peptide antagonist losartan showed excitation of neurons in the preoptic/medial septum region of urethane-anesthetized male Wistar rats. DOCA pretreatment further enhances this neuronal excitation in response to AngII and reduces the responses to losartan. This generated the hypothesis that DOCA-enhanced AngII-induced neuronal excitation is the neural support for the synergy theory. AT- 2 receptors modulate these intake responses depending on sodium in the diet, and diuretic-induced dehydration during pregnancy produces a higher salt intake in the offspring. AngII-induced salt and <b>water</b> <b>intakes</b> were <b>tested</b> in offspring from Sprague Dawley mothers with only 1. 8 % NaCl to drink in which half were treated with furosemide. The important observations were a) the AT- 1 antagonist alone suppressed intakes in offspring from mothers not treated with furosemide, b) both AT- 1 and AT- 2 antagonists suppressed intakes in offspring from furosemide-treated mothers, and c) combined administration of AT- 1 and AT- 2 antagonists greatly suppressed <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> in offspring from mothers not treated with furosemide. These results suggest that AT- 1 and AT- 2 receptors have variable properties (receptor number and/or second messengers). Furthermore, the activity and function of these central AngII receptors depend on the background mineralocorticoid levels. The exact mechanism of this influence, however, remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nandrolone {{decanoate}} (ND) is a {{doping agent}} {{which is used}} by athletes and {{has a lot of}} adverse effects on the body. Objectives: This survey was carried out to evaluate the effects of subacute supraphysiological dose of ND administration on liver enzymes and lipid profiles in male and female rats. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 40 Wistar-Albino rats, which after weighing divided into 4 groups as control (female and male) and test (female and male) groups (N = 10). The test groups received 15 mg/kg nandrolone decanoate by intra muscular (im) injection for 2 weeks, but control groups received the same volum of oil vehicle. At the end, animals were deeply anesthetized by diethyl ether, scarified and their blood samples were collected. Liver enzymes and lipoproteins were measured by usual methods. Obtained data were analyzed by SPSS- 15, applying ANOVA and Tukey tests. Results were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical difference was recognized significant by P ≤ 0. 05. Results: Results showed that AST value in the test groups were significantly increased compared to those of the control groups. In addition, HDL and cholesterol values in female test group were significantly increased compared to those of male test group.

We used a nationally representative sample of 25, 122 Korean adults aged ≥ 19 years, from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008 – 2012. We performed multiple regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related variables to investigate the contribution of overall energy and dietary intakes and eating behaviors to total <b>water</b> <b>intake.</b> The mean total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> excluding plain <b>water</b> was 1071 g (398 g from beverages and 673 g from foods) and the estimated plain <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> was 1. 3 L.

40|$|Salt appetite, the {{primordial}} instinct to favorably ingest salty substances, represents a vital evolutionary important drive to successfully maintain body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. This innate instinct was shown here in Sprague-Dawley rats by increased ingestion of isotonic saline (IS) over <b>water</b> in fluid <b>intake</b> <b>tests.</b> However, this appetitive stimulus was fundamentally {{transformed into a}} powerfully aversive one by increasing the salt content of drinking fluid from IS to hypertonic saline (2 % w/v NaCl, HS) in <b>intake</b> <b>tests.</b> Rats ingested HS similar to IS when given no choice in one-bottle tests and previous {{studies have indicated that}} this may modify salt appetite. We thus investigated if a single 24 h experience of ingesting IS or HS, dehydration (DH) or 4 % high salt food (HSD) altered salt preference. Here we show that 24 h of ingesting IS and HS solutions, but not DH or HSD, robustly transformed salt appetite in rats when tested 7 days and 35 days later. Using two-bottle tests rats previously exposed to IS preferred neither IS or water, whereas rats exposed to HS showed aversion to IS. Responses to sweet solutions (1 % sucrose) were not different in two-bottle tests with water, suggesting that salt was the primary aversive taste pathway recruited in this model. Inducing thirst by subcutaneous administration of angiotensin II did not overcome this salt aversion. We hypothesised that this behavior results from altered gene expression in brain structures important in thirst and salt appetite. Thus we also report here lasting changes in mRNAs for markers of neuronal activity, peptide hormones and neuronal plasticity in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamu...|$|R

40|$|A 2008 Associated Press {{study of}} 28 major United States municipalities’ water {{provider}} testing results uncovered traces {{of a wide}} variety of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and antibiotics in 24 of the cities’ drinking water. These chemical compounds have been linked to two sources; the flushing or dumping of medications down the drain, and the passage of excess chemicals through the human body and into municipal wastewater. Municipal wastewater treatment plants do not have the technology or infrastructure to remove these chemicals from the water, so they enter a stream or river and are carried downstream. In the Animas River Basin, in and around Durango, Colorado no testing has been conducted for the presence of pharmaceutical compounds or endocrine disrupting chemicals. Many case studies have screened wastewater effluent and stream water for these chemicals throughout the country, the majority with similar results. A cooperative study with United States Geological Survey and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection of the Environmental Protection Agency tested streams near drinking <b>water</b> <b>intakes</b> in Pennsylvania in 2007. Over a three-year study, 27 drinking <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> sites were <b>tested</b> throughout the state. These <b>intakes</b> were <b>tested</b> for levels of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and antibiotics. All of the 27 sites had at least one compound detected. The most commonly detected pharmaceuticals were caffeine, Carbamazepine, (A mood stabilizing drug), Acetaminophen, antihistamines, and Cotinine, a derivative of nicotine. The most commonly detected hormones included Estrone, Androstene, 17 -beta estradiol, and Cis-androsterone, all human male and female hormones. All levels of contaminants were found at very minimal levels in the parts per trillion concentrations. Although low, these levels have been proven detrimental to wildlife. Aquatic species are most reactive to these chemicals and have been proven to intersex and stop reproduction altogether when introduced to certain human hormones like Estrone or Estradiol, common hormones in birth control. Emerging research has prompted the research and development of wastewater chemical removal methods such as Ozonation, Activated Carbon removal, and Forward Osmosis removal. This research suggests a screening of the Animas River needs to be conducted for the presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors so solutions and prevention strategies can be implemented if needed...|$|R

40|$|Aim The {{prevalence}} of hyponatremia {{in the elderly}} is quite high due to the rising of ADH and ANP concentrations which are part of eight physiologic changes. The complications are quite specific, among others, increased risk of bone fracture, declining of conciousness, and convulsion. The frequent cause of hyponatremia is high <b>water</b> <b>intake.</b> To achieve the optimal <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> designated as the highest <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> that did not cause hyponatremia and hypovolemia. Methods A study was conducted on 31 healthy elderly subjects, selected from 107 persons using simple random sampling and exclusion criteria. By block randomisation were classified into five water-intake groups (1000 - 2500 mL). Results In this study, it could be proved that 1000 mL was the optimal. It was also unraveled that the ADH levels {{had a role in}} determining the <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> volume that did not cause hyponatremia and NT-proBNP concentrations did not correlate with spot urine sodium. Conclusion The optimal <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> for the elderly is 1000 mL per day. (Med J Indones 2009; 18 : 18 - 24) Keywords: Hyponatremia, healthy elderly, <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> </p...|$|R

Male Holtzman rats weighing 200 - 250 g with canulae implanted into the SON were used. The drugs were injected in 0. 5 �L over 30 - 60 sec. The <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> after injection of saline SAL+SAL 0. 15 M NaCl was 0. 40 � 0. 1 mL 2 h - 1; SAL+ANGII increase <b>water</b> <b>intake.</b> Losartan decreased the <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> induced by ANGII. PD 123319 injected prior to produce no change in <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> induced by ANGII. AVPA prior to ANGII reduced the <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> with a less intensity than losartan. L-arginine prior to ANGII decreases the <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> at a same intensity than losartan. L-NAME prior to ANGII potentiated the dipsogenic effect of ANGII. Losartan injected simultaneously with L-arginine prior to ANGII blocked the dipsogenic effect of ANGII. These results confirm the importance of SON in the control of <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> and strongly suggest that AT 1, V 1 receptors interact with nitrergic pathways within the SON influencing the dipsogenic effect of ANGII...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of present tomb {{conditions of the}} Royal Tomb of Seti I in the Valley of the Kings with Burton's photographs (1921 – 1928) reveals that the rock structure and tomb decoration have undergone severe deterioration. In fact, several other Royal Tombs in the Valley of the Kings have shown similar decay features. Most of the Royal Tombs in the Valley of the Kings and the West Valley were excavated into the marls of the middle and lower part of Member I, the lowermost unit of the Thebes Formation. However, several tombs penetrate into the underlying interbedded shales and marls of the Esna Formation. All of them show severe, irreversible rock structure deterioration originating from swelling and shrinkage. Since the burial of Seti I, 3300 years ago, water and debris from flash floods had minor impacts on wall decoration of the uppermost chambers and on wall structure in the lower chambers. Historic flooding since {{the discovery of the}} tomb has caused major destruction of walls and pillars by repeated swelling and shrinkage of the shale. Moreover, accelerated humidity changes over the past 70 years have contributed to increasing deterioration of the rock structure. Rock mechanic analyses were done on samples from the tomb of Seti I {{in order to understand the}} propelling mechanism of deterioration. Marls and limestones of the Thebes Formation are predominantly composed of calcite, with 10 – 40 % clay minerals and minor amounts of quartz and anhydrite. Sepiolite and palygorskite are the dominant clay minerals in the Thebes Formation, with subordinate amounts of kaolinite and illite/smectite mixed layers. The shales of the Esna Formation contain more than 70 % clay minerals, which are composed of illite/smectite mixed layers, with high swelling capacity, kaolinite and subordinate palygorskite and sepiolite. The marls of the lower Thebes Formation showed dry compressive strength values between 48 MPa (7000 psi) and 78 MPa (11 300 psi) before violent failure, with a maximum elastic deformation of 0. 4 – 0. 5 %. The Esna Shale samples had maximum stress loads of 60 MPa (8500 psi) and 74 MPa (10 800 psi) with a maximum deformation of more than 2 %. The deformation character changed with increasing pressure from an elastic to an inelastic mode. Long-term swell tests on Esna Shale samples revealed an enormous water absorption and swelling capacity. Swell heaving is between 50 and 80 %, most of which takes place within the first hour. The swell pressure exceeds 5 MPa (700 psi) and 13 MPa (1900 psi) with a deformation of 1. 5 and 3. 3 %, respectively. The swell pressure increases to its maximum over a period of 7 – 12 days. The rock tests showed that the swell pressure capacity of the Esna shales might exceed the strength of the brittle and highly jointed marls of Member I, into which most of the tombs are hewn. The swell and <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated that <b>water</b> absorption of the Esna shales is immediate. Mineralogical analyses showed that mixed-layer clay minerals are able to release enormous pressure, which may be ‘compensated’ through ductile deformation by the shales or may result in brittle failure of the marls...|$|R

Injections of 80 nmol/rat of both GR 113808 and SB 204070 were unable to modify <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> in normohydrated rats. Pretreatment with GR 113808 (40 and 80 nmol/rat) and SB 204070 (80 and 160 nmol/rat) blunted <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> after third ventricle injections of angiotensin II (9. 6 pmol/rat) compared to saline-pretreated controls. Pretreatment with 80 nmol/rat of both antagonists potentiated drinking induced by third ventricle injections of carbachol (11. 0 nmol/rat) compared to saline-pretreated control. In all doses employed, none of the compounds was able to modify <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> in dehydrated rats. A separate control test using one-bottle taste aversion paradigm indicated that the reduction in <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> observed in some of the present experiments could not be attributed to a drug-induced malaise.

However, when these compounds were administered SC in combination with either the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, isoproterenol (10 to 25 micro-g/kg, SC), or with angiotensin 2 (200 micro-g/kg, SC). <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> was enhanced.
