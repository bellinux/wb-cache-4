5|$|At age 15, Northrup {{moved in}} with sister Helen and her husband Jack, while she {{finished}} high school. Parsons had subdivided the house, a rambling mansion {{next door to the}} estate of Adolphus Busch (which later became the first Busch Gardens), into 19 apartments which he populated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> artists, writers, scientists and occultists.

5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C {{for a few minutes}} results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3. It may possibly be produced by acting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000°C.|$|E

5|$|Route X43 was {{initially}} served <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> double-deck Leyland Titans and single-deck Leyland Tigers. In the early 1960s these {{were replaced by}} new Leyland Leopards. From 1974 coaches were used on the route, with Leyland Leopards again the preferred choice. In 1982 a small number were branded for the route, using the name Timesaver and the tagline Regular Motorway service.|$|E
5|$|Rura Penthe {{was created}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> on-set and {{location}} shots, {{along with an}} establishing sequence created by Matte World. The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on fiberfill clouds with lights behind them to create a lightning storm underway in the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} was not recorded, {{but it probably}} involved replacing the blood <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> turpentine and vermilion. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored {{in the house of}} Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|The {{summit of}} Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, {{featuring}} {{plants such as}} Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens). Also noted are Carex atrata var. pullata, Salix desertorum, Platanthera hyperborea, Thalictrum fendleri, Aquilegia canadensis, Chenopodium album, Gentiana detonsa var. hallii, and Bigelovia parryi. Below treeline the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> lodgepole pine, spruce, aspen and fir.|$|E
5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials. Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|E

5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E
5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's name and title, usually spelt <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> runes and Latin script, with {{some aspects of}} the coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or a cross) within a circle of pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of a cross and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest that few of his dies remain undiscovered.|$|E

5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become indifferent to the yōkais presence, and fail to see them as they go about their lives.|$|E
