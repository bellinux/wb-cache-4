5|$|An {{alternative}} mourning {{style is}} to <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> spherical finial with black cloth {{and place a}} black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style {{dates back to the}} death of Emperor Meiji on July 30, 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the national flag should be raised in mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.|$|E
5|$|By 1874, the Louvre Palace had {{achieved}} {{its present form}} of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the Cour Carrée (Square Court) and the oldest parts of the Louvre; and two wings which <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> Cour Napoléon, the Richelieu Wing {{to the north and}} the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south. In 1983, French President François Mitterrand proposed, as one of his Grands Projets, the Grand Louvre plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid to stand over a new entrance in the main court, the Cour Napoléon. The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988; the pyramid was completed in 1989. The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan, La Pyramide Inversée (The Inverted Pyramid), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{his first}} Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 {{in the first}} Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in {{first-class}} cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests. India went on to <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings. In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali, his second highest ODI score. He then made 65 in the series-deciding fifth game at Visakhapatnam which India won.|$|E

5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E

25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E

25|$|If not {{consumed}} immediately, {{there are}} storing techniques {{that can help}} to keep the bagel moist and fresh.

25|$|By {{counting}} {{the number of}} wraps for the skein, and measuring the length of one <b>wrap,</b> <b>the</b> approximate yardage can be calculated. The yardage is approximate because an exact yardage requires an even tension throughout wrapping the whole skein. Also, a very large skein requires wrapping the new layers on top of the old, which increases the length of the top layers.|$|E
25|$|By {{the tenth}} century, the Persians, who had {{converted}} to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks.

25|$|Method of storing the material. <b>Wrap</b> <b>the</b> scabs {{carefully}} in paper {{and put them}} into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated.

The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not usually}} {{stated in the}} score, timpanists will change sticks to suit {{the nature of the}} music. However, the choice during a {{performance}} is subjective and depends on the timpanist's preference and occasionally the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of sticks. The weight of the stick, size and latent surface area of the head, materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and method used to <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.|$|E

25|$|Others {{started looking}} for ways to {{stabilise}} the plasma during compression, and by 1953 two concepts had come to the fore. One solution was to <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> vacuum tube in a sheet of thin but highly conductive metal. If the plasma column began to move, the current in the plasma would induce a magnetic field in the sheet, one that, due to Lenz's law, would push back against the plasma. This was most effective against large, slow movements, like the entire plasma torus drifting within the chamber.|$|E
25|$|Both women {{allegedly}} {{helped to}} <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> {{body in a}} napkin. They kept some of the clothes Marmon had packed; the rest was destined for the pawnbroker. Dyer paid the rent to the unwitting landlady, {{and gave her a}} pair of child's boots as a present for her little girl. The following day, Wednesday 1 April 1896, another child, named Harry Simmons, was taken to Mayo Road. However, with no spare white edging tape available, the length around Doris' corpse was removed and used to strangle the 13-month-old boy.|$|E
25|$|Maniaq (lit. «roasted thing») is roasted (barbecued) over an {{open fire}} fish. All parts of the fish except the guts are used.
