40|$|This study investigates {{experimentally}} {{the effects}} of hydrogen addition in the intake manifold of a diesel generator operating with a 7 % biodiesel-diesel oil blend (B 7). An experimental apparatus setup was used to conduct performance and emissions tests in a single cylinder, air cooled diesel engine. This setup consisted of a generator set connected to a <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistor</b> load bank {{that was used to}} vary engine load. In addition, a flowmeter was used to determine hydrogen volumetric flowrate and a digital anemometer coupled with an air box to measure air flowrate. Furthermore, a digital precision electronic scale was used to measure engine fuel consumption and a gas analyzer was used to determine exhaust gas composition and exhaust gas temperature. A thermopar was installed near the exhaust collection to measure cylinder temperature. In-cylinder pressure was measured using an AVL Indumicro data acquisition system with a piezoelectric pressure sensor. An AVL optical encoder was installed in the crankshaft and synchronized with in-cylinder pressure in real time. The experimental procedure consisted of injecting hydrogen into the engine intake manifold at different mass concentrations of 2, 6, 8 and 10 % of total fuel mass (B 7 + hydrogen), which represented energy fractions of 5, 15, 20 and 24 % of total fuel energy respectively. Due to hydrogen addition, the total amount of fuel energy introduced increased and the generators fuel injection governor prevented any increases of engine speed. Several conclusions can be stated from the test results. A reduction in specific fuel consumption as a function of hydrogen concentration increase was noted. Likewise, carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) decreased as hydrogen concentration increased. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides emissions (NOx) increased due to average temperatures inside the cylinder being higher. There was also an increase in peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate inside the cylinder, since the fuel ignition delay was smaller due to hydrogen content increase. All this indicates that hydrogen promotes faster combustion and higher heat release rates and can be an important additive to all kind of fuels used in diesel generators...|$|E
50|$|Applications of <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> {{are similar}} to those of {{composition}} resistors with the exception of the high frequency. The high frequency response of <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> is substantially worse than that of a composition resistor.|$|R
25|$|There {{can also}} be failure of {{resistors}} due to mechanical stress and adverse environmental factors including humidity. If not enclosed, <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> can corrode.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> are {{commonly}} made by winding a metal wire, usually nichrome, around a ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core. The {{ends of the}} wire are soldered or welded to two caps or rings, attached {{to the ends of}} the core. The assembly is protected with a layer of paint, molded plastic, or an enamel coating baked at high temperature. These resistors are designed to withstand unusually high temperatures of up to 450°C. Wire leads in low power <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> are usually between 0.6 and 0.8mm in diameter and tinned for ease of soldering. For higher power <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors,</b> either a ceramic outer case or an aluminum outer case on top of an insulating layer is used – if the outer case is ceramic, such resistors are sometimes described as [...] "cement" [...] resistors, though they do not actually contain any traditional cement. The aluminum-cased types are designed to be attached to a heat sink to dissipate the heat; the rated power is dependent on being used with a suitable heat sink, e.g., a 50 W power rated resistor overheats at a fraction of the power dissipation if not used with a heat sink. Large <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> may be rated for 1,000 watts or more.|$|R
25|$|Carbon {{film and}} {{composition}} resistors can fail (open circuit) if running {{close to their}} maximum dissipation. This is also possible but less likely with metal film and <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Earlier power <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors,</b> such as brown vitreous-enameled types, however, {{were made}} with a {{different}} system of preferred values, such as some of those mentioned in the first sentence of this section.|$|R
50|$|Carbon film {{resistors}} have temperature {{coefficients of}} several 100 {{parts per million}} per degree C. Some <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> have coefficients of 10 ppm/°C. Some off-the-shelf metal foil resistors can be as low as 0.2 ppm/°C.|$|R
50|$|When overheated, carbon-film {{resistors}} may decrease {{or increase}} in resistance.Carbon film and composition resistors can fail (open circuit) if running {{close to their}} maximum dissipation. This is also possible but less likely with metal film and <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Because <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> are coils {{they have}} more {{undesirable}} inductance than other types of resistor, although winding the wire in sections with alternately reversed direction can minimize inductance. Other techniques employ bifilar winding, or a flat thin former (to reduce cross-section area of the coil). For the most demanding circuits, resistors with Ayrton-Perry winding are used.|$|R
50|$|Bifilar coil - a coil wound {{with two}} parallel, closely spaced strands. If AC {{currents}} are passed through {{it in the}} same direction, the magnetic fluxes will add, but if equal currents in opposite directions pass through the windings the opposite fluxes will cancel, resulting in zero flux in the core. So no voltage will be induced in a third winding on the core. These are used in instruments and in devices like Ground Fault Interrupters. They are also used in low inductance <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> for use at RF frequencies.|$|R
40|$|In {{the shadow}} of microelectronics, passive {{components}} such as discrete resistors {{would seem to have}} fallen out of the field of view in electronics. Yet, it is the rare circuit that can do without resistors. And a look at a modern circuit board will show that it has become more difficult to locate them visually. OVERVIEW Linear fixed resistors are classified as film, foil, composition, Power Metal Strip®, and <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors,</b> depending on the material used. Film resistors can be further subdivided into carbon, metal and thick film resistors. Fig. 1 - Linear fixed resistors technologies Going by sales figures, metal film and thick film resistors are the most widely used types.

2500|$|A {{resistor}} {{may have}} one or more fixed tapping points so that the resistance can be changed by moving the connecting wires to different terminals. [...] Some <b>wirewound</b> power <b>resistors</b> have a tapping point that can slide along the resistance element, allowing a larger or smaller part of the resistance to be used.|$|R
5000|$|Ayrton-Perry winding {{is a type}} of {{bifilar winding}} pattern used in winding wire on forms to make {{electronic}} components. Its advantage is that the resulting coil of wire has low values of parasitic inductance and parasitic capacitance. [...] Ayrton-Perry windings of resistance wire are used to make <b>wirewound</b> RF <b>resistors</b> that are used at high frequencies, where inductance and capacitance are unwanted.|$|R
50|$|Circuit {{diagrams}} {{are pictures}} with symbols that have differed {{from country to}} country and have changed over time, but are now to a large extent internationally standardized. Simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device. For example, the symbol for a resistor shown here dates back to the days when that component was made from a long piece of wire wrapped in such a manner as to not produce inductance, which would have made it a coil. These <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors</b> are now used only in high-power applications, smaller resistors being cast from carbon composition (a mixture of carbon and filler) or fabricated as an insulating tube or chip coated with a metal film. The internationally standardized symbol for a resistor is therefore now simplified to an oblong, sometimes with the value in ohms written inside, instead of the zig-zag symbol. A less common symbol is simply a series of peaks {{on one side of the}} line representing the conductor, rather than back-and-forth as shown here.|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{temperature}} sensors {{have been developed}} for wide-range temperature applications. The two sensors measure temperature in the range of - 190 to + 200 C and utilize a thin-film platinum RTD (resistance temperature detector) as the temperature-sensing element. Other parts used in the fabrication of these sensors include NPO (negative-positive- zero) type ceramic capacitors for timing, thermally-stable film or <b>wirewound</b> <b>resistors,</b> and high-temperature circuit boards and solder. The first type of temperature sensor is a relaxation oscillator circuit using an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) operational amplifier as a comparator. The output is a pulse train with a period that is roughly proportional to the temperature being measured. The voltage level of the pulse train is high-level, for example 10 V. The high-level output makes the sensor less sensitive to noise or electromagnetic interference. The output can be read by a frequency or period meter and then converted into a temperature reading. The second type of temperature sensor is made up of various types of multivibrator circuits using an SOI type 555 timer and the passive components mentioned above. Three configurations have been developed that were based on the technique of charging and discharging a capacitor through a resistive element to create a train of pulses governed by the capacitor-resistor time constant. Both types of sensors, which operated successfully over the wide temperature range, have potential use in extreme temperature environments including jet engines and space exploration missions...|$|R
