25|$|A key-point of {{the game}} is that the actions of the players do not always have the {{expected}} outcome.

25|$|Publicly, Mr. Obama {{has said}} that both sides bear {{responsibility}} for the latest collapse.

25|$|Resolution 242 {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely affirmed resolutions on the Arab–Israeli {{conflict}} and formed the basis for later negotiations between the parties. These led to Peace Treaties between Israel and Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994), as well as the 1993 and 1995 agreements <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b>|$|E
25|$|EU Ambassador to Israel, Lars Faaborg-Andersen said if {{peace talks}} fail, Israel {{will likely be}} blamed for the break down.

25|$|The Arrow missile, {{a missile}} {{designed}} to destroy ballistic missiles, including Scud missiles, was first deployed by Israel. In 2001, with the Peace Process increasingly in disarray, Ehud Barak called {{a special election}} for Prime Minister.

After this election, the system of directly electing the Premier was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} Israeli {{fatalities}} {{in the current}} conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> exceeded 1,000 last week. Only two of the country's wars – the War of Independence and the Yom Kippur War – have claimed more Israeli lives than this intifada, which began on September 29, 2000. In the Six-Day War, 803 Israelis lost their lives, while the War of Attrition claimed 738 Israeli lives along the borders with Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Fighting between Maronite and Palestinian forces (mainly {{from the}} Palestine Liberation Organization) began in 1975, then Leftist, pan-Arabist and Muslim Lebanese groups formed an {{alliance}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> During {{the course of}} the fighting, alliances shifted rapidly and unpredictably. Furthermore, foreign powers, such as Israel and Syria, became involved in the war and fought alongside different factions. Peace keeping forces, such as the Multinational Force in Lebanon & UNIFIL, were also stationed in Lebanon.|$|E

Arab rioting took place throughout northern Israel. Violence takes place in Umm al-Fahm, Nazareth, Acre, Fureidis, and villages throughout the Galilee. In {{a number of areas}} police came under gunfire, and demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails. An Egged bus was torched in Umm al-Fahm.|$|E
25|$|The Armenian Marxist-Leninist militia ASALA {{was founded}} in PLO-controlled {{territory}} of West Beirut in 1975. This militia was led by revolutionary fighter Monte Melkonian and group-founder Hagop Hagopian. Closely aligned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> ASALA fought many battles {{on the side of}} the Lebanese National Movement and the PLO, most prominently against Israeli forces and their right-wing allies during the 1982 phase of the war. Melkonian was field commander during these battles, and assisted the PLO in its defense of West Beirut.|$|E

The following year, she led her party to win a plurality of seats in the Knesset, but was again blocked from becoming prime minister, due to the rightist parties' majority in the Knesset. Consequently, she served as Leader of the Opposition from 2009, until her resignation from the Knesset in 2012.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} {{peering through the}} keyhole of a closed door on what it {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited over the threshold {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of the Palestinian cause, but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot of the Israelis to oppose reconciliation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b>|$|E
25|$|Concerning energy, Lomborg {{asserts that}} oil {{is not being}} {{depleted}} as fast as is claimed, and that improvements of technology will provide people with fossil fuels for years to come. The author further asserts that many alternatives already exist, and that with time they will replace fossil fuels as an energy source. Concerning other resources, such as metals, Lomborg suggests that based on their price history {{they are not in}} short supply. Examining the challenge of collecting sufficient amounts of water, Lomborg says that wars will probably not erupt over water because fighting such wars is not cost-effective (one week of war <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> for instance, would cost Israel more than five desalination plants, according to an Israeli officer). Lomborg emphasizes the need for better water management, as water is distributed unequally around the world.|$|E
25|$|In a video titled “The Truth About the West Bank” {{released}} by the Israeli foreign ministry in June 2011, Ayalon presents a historical narrative meant to help wage the public diplomacy battle about Israel’s ongoing conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> In the video made in cooperation with StandWithUs, which {{is very similar to}} one released earlier by the Yesha council, the organization of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Ayalon asks viewers to stop referring to the West Bank as “occupied territories”. “It is time for Israel to return to a ‘rights-based diplomacy’ and talk about the facts, rights, history and international law which are little known but give a dramatically different viewpoint to what is currently accepted,” he said after the video’s release. After the video was posted online, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority’s top negotiator, denounced the video as a “falsified account of history and international law”, but refused to participate in a public debate on the issues raised in the video proposed by Ayalon.|$|E
