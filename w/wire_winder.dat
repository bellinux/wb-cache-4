40|$|A {{company for}} car glass repair {{requested}} a physical load evaluation study of three cutting methods for windshield removal. Aim {{was to get}} indications of the cutting forces {{in relation to the}} postures observed. A cutting knife, a traditional cutting wire and a new developed <b>wire</b> <b>winder</b> were tested. With two operators, two test series on 6 similar cars were executed. In series 1, postures were observed without disturbing the task execution. In series 2 we measured the forces with transducers fixed to the tool, requiring breaks in task execution. The results indicate large differences in main forces between tools. Heavy static pushing and pulling, up till the human limit, awkward body postures and precision was observed during the use of the knife. The <b>wire</b> <b>winder</b> rated best for forces and postures. It could be executed sitting in the car, contributing to a preferred variation of prolonged standing in other tasks. The <b>wire</b> <b>winder</b> was recommended, especially for ‘hard to cut’ seams. The tool and the preparational work could be further optimized. The traditional wire cutter was second best, but a risk of backward falling exists if a wire breaks; an improved work method could reduce hand force and risk. The cutting knife was not recommended...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{project was}} {{commissioned}} {{in order to}} provide engineers with the necessary knowledge of steel <b>wire</b> <b>winder</b> ropes so that they may make accurate decisions as to when a rope is near the end of its useful life. For this purpose, a knowledge base was compiled from the experience of experts in the field in order to create an expert system to aid the engineer in his task. The EXSYS expert system shell was used to construct a rule-based program which would be run on a personal computer. The program derived in this thesis is named ROPES, and provides information as to the forms of damage that may be present in a rope and the effect of any defects on rope strength and rope life. Advice is given as to the procedures that should be followed when damage is detected as well as the conditions which would necessitate rope discard and the urgency with which the replacement should take place. The expert system program will provide engineers with the necessary expertise and experience to assess, more accurately than at present, the condition of a winder rope. This should lead to longer rope life and improved safety with the associated cost savings. Rope assessment will also be more uniform with changes to policy being able to be implemented quickly and on an ongoing basis as technology and experience improves. The program ROPES, although compiled from expert knowledge, still requires the further input of personal opinions and inferences to some extent. For this reason, the program cannot be assumed infallible and must be used as an aid only...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{description}} of the industrial machine of the DWT (drywall tape) rewinder. The winder rewinds and cuts the drywall tape tape into smaller tapes, that are then sold. The first part contains a description of the winder, its structure and functions of its individual parts. The second part contains a description of the control system and the power <b>wiring</b> of <b>winder.</b> The next section contains a description of programming and setting of PLC, frequency inverters, and touch panel. Some modifications are then described when putting the winder into operation. The winder has been successfully implemented and built into a continuous shift operation. However, the development of the rewinder continues to improve its features and user-friendliness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Today's {{brushless}} {{permanent magnet}} (PM) drive systems usually adopt motors including the advancements in magnet technology, e. g. better thermal characteristics and higher magnetic strength. By this means, they become capable in the roughest applications yet maintain a high accuracy at competitive prices. These drive {{systems are not}} only appreciated for their high performance, {{but they are also}} advantageous for the applications requiring tough, dependable, and continuous-duty operations, e. g. hybrid or complete electrical vehicles, extruders, <b>wire</b> drawers, <b>winders,</b> cranes, conveyors, and roll formers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an extended comparative study of the different motor configurations for the hybrid electric drive application, aiming at a compromise between high power density and extended speed capability. Design/methodology/approach – To suit strict design requirements, such as the very limited volumetric envelope, high-output power, wide constant power speed range, and pre-selected in-direct cooling system, the constraint variants of possible motor types are researched. Findings – Considerably, high torque density and an extended speed range limit the options of PM rotor configurations for this motor design. The considered rotor configurations are the surface PM (SPM) and interior PM (IPM) types. The advantage of the (non-salient) SPM configuration is its applicability with higher levels of magnetic flux densities without causing significant saturation in the rotor. On the other hand, an IPM rotor, which places the magnets in special rotor slots, open or closed (by saturation bridges), can operate on both the reluctance torque and the magnet alignment torque. This generally leads to a better performance in a wide speed range. However, this advantage can be eliminated by severe iron saturation resulting from the required high-specific power. Originality/value – The most appropriate rotor configuration will finally be selected between the two considered types, depending on detailed electromagnetic and thermal analysis. This paper usefully studies the correlation between the motor parameters required for high power density and field-weakening performance...|$|R
