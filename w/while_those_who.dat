5|$|In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a {{study of}} American {{television}} viewers and found that fans of The Daily Show had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign {{survey conducted by the}} Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as The Daily Show as a source for news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> learned from comedy shows were the least informed.|$|E
5|$|Pollack {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' experiences.

5|$|He re-emerges {{during the}} revolt of Saturninus in 89. On 1 January, 89, the {{governor}} of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, revolted against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} a tribe of the Chatti. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished.

5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E
5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E

They celebrate major cultural festivals such as Hungry Ghost Festival and the Chinese New Year much as their ancestors did. Chinese settlers in Sarawak were not limited to any one area. Those who settled in Kuching did so near the Sarawak River {{in an area that}} is now referred to as Chinatown. Immigrants from Fujian, led by Wong Nai Siong in 1901, settled along the Rajang River in what is now Sibu, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> arrived in Miri sought work in the coal mines and oilfields.|$|E
5|$|After 1555, {{the initial}} {{reconciling}} {{tone of the}} regime began to harden. The medieval heresy laws were restored. The Marian Persecutions of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. This resulted in the Queen becoming known as Bloody Mary, due {{to the influence of}} John Foxe, one of the Protestants who fled Marian England. Foxe's Book of Martyrs recorded the executions in such detail that it became Mary's epitaph; Convocation subsequently ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land. In fact, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were executed after the revolts of 1536, and the St David's Down rebellion of 1549, and the unknown number of monks who died for refusing to submit, may not have been tried for heresy, they certainly exceeded that number by some amount. Even so, the heroism of some of the martyrs was an example to those who witnessed them, so that in some places it was the burnings that set people against the regime.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep into debt and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the creditor would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the creditor demanded payment in sound money.

5|$|During Beebe's later years, Simla was an {{important}} gathering point for researchers in many other areas of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh {{that had been a}} gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left.|$|E
5|$|Following the 39th Battalion's {{return to}} Australia, {{the men were}} given a period of leave before 30th Brigade was reconstituted on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Initially, {{the plan was to}} reorganise the brigade and rebuild it prior to {{returning}} it to New Guinea, but in July it was decided that the 30th Brigade, along with its component battalions—the 39th, 49th, and 3rd Battalions—would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division, with reinforcements being sent to the 16th and 19th Brigades. This came into effect on 3 July 1943 {{and as a result of}} this decision, the Militiamen that had been called up for service were transferred to the 36th Battalion, a Militia battalion from New South Wales, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had volunteered for overseas service were sent to the 2/2nd Battalion; both of these units later saw further service in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{leaders of}} the Kilab {{continued}} to hold the title of amir al-ʿarab after the Ayyubid conquest of Aleppo in 1182. As a result, Haditha's jurisdiction initially did not extend to the Aleppo region (northern Syria). However, during {{the latter half of}} az-Zahir Ghazi (r. 1193–1216) of Aleppo's reign, the Kilab were brought under Haditha's authority and were stripped of the amir al-ʿarab title. According to medieval Arab historian Ibn al-Adim (d. 1262), the Kilab's status was downgraded because of the growing power of the Tayy clans, while al-Hamdani asserts that the numerically-superior Kilab were weakened by a divided leadership. Following the extension of Haditha's jurisdiction to their traditional territory, some of the Kilab migrated north to Anatolia, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> remained became allies of Haditha's Al Fadl clan.|$|E

5|$|Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, was {{singled out}} in {{particular}} for his central {{involvement in the}} rebellion, and for him the multiple was seven rather than five. The same {{was the case for}} Henry de Hastings, who was the commander of Kenilworth Castle. Those who had not taken part in the fighting themselves, but had incited others to rise up against the king, were fined at two years' value, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had been compelled to fight, or played only a minor part, had to pay one year's value of their land. The proceedings from the fines were awarded to royal supporters, some of whom had already been awarded parts of the rebels' land, and now had to give it back.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army Ranger Company was {{deactivated}} on 31 March 1951. Some of its {{equipment was}} subsequently consolidated with the 5th Ranger Infantry Company, which was newly arrived in Korea {{and had been}} assigned to the 25th Infantry Division. The men of the new Ranger company had formally attended Ranger School, though they were inexperienced and less effective in their initial actions with the division. In the meantime, most of the men of the former Eighth Army Ranger Company were transferred to other units of the 25th Infantry Division, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were paratrooper qualified through the United States Army Airborne School were allowed to transfer to the 187th Regimental Combat Team or one of the other Ranger companies then beginning to arrive in Korea. During its brief existence, the Eighth Army Ranger Company saw 164 days of combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
