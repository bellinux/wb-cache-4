40|$|This paper compares {{different}} {{solutions in}} micro <b>wind-power</b> <b>system</b> design. An economic analysis {{is carried out}} {{on the basis of}} the selected generator, power converter, and mechanical system. An interior permanent-magnet (PM) (IPM) generator is considered since it can be driven in the flux weakening region, exploiting higher turbine rotation speeds, without increasing proportionally the terminal voltage. The performance of the <b>wind-power</b> <b>system</b> adopting the IPM generator is compared with that adopting a surface-mounted PM generator. Several cases are considered, by imposing some constraints on both the maximum input torque of the generator and the volt-ampere rating of the power converter, as well as combining both limitations together. This paper highlights a methodology to determine the economic advantages obtained introducing such limitations, in terms of both return on investment and money profit during a given period, e. g., of 20 years. The study focuses on how to apply the proposed technique, such as constant torque region, flux weakening, and stalling mode, founding the optimal power and torque ratings {{on the basis of the}} maximum profit over payback time...|$|E

Today, solar and <b>wind-power</b> <b>systems</b> would be able to collect enough solar energy from the Sun easily.

In addition, the system's minimum acceptable reliability contribution is investigated for determining the minimum cost stand-alone system dimensions. Finally, the consumer size effect is taken into consideration during the best choice selection process.

Predictive current control presents as fast dynamic response and accurate reference tracking as other well established control methods, while providing more flexibility. In this work, three different control strategies are applied to the grid-side NPC converter, in order to fulfil LVRT requirements, which are implemented with the predictive current control technique.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{off-grid}} hybrid {{wind energy system}} is financially attractive and more reliable than stand-alone power systems since {{it is based on}} more than one electricity generation source. One of the most expensive components in a stand-alone <b>wind-power</b> <b>system</b> is the energy storage system as very often it is oversized to increase system autonomy. In this work, we consider a hybrid system which consists of wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, diesel generator and battery storage. One of the main challenges experienced by project managers is the sizing of components for different sites. This challenge is due to the variability of the renewable energy resource and the load demand for different sites. This paper introduces a sizing model that has been developed and implemented as a graphical user interface, which predicts the optimum configuration of a hybrid system. In particular, this paper focuses on seeking the optimal size of the batteries and the diesel generator usage. Both of these components are seen to be trade-offs from each other. The model simulates real time operation of the hybrid system, using the annual measured hourly wind speed and solar irradiation. The benefit of using time series approach is that it reflects a more realistic situation; here, the peaks and troughs of the renewable energy resource are a central part of the sizing model. Finally, load sensitivity and hybrid system performance analysis are demonstrated...|$|E

Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|R

Yet, only one wind turbine has actually been placed in Norwegian waters; a floating demonstration turbine. This development is {{in stark contrast to}} the emphasis on offshore wind-power in some of the neighbouring countries. Thus, it is safe to assume that some of the basic premises for the development of offshore wind-power are not met in Norway. Inspired by the theoretical framework of Functions of Technology-specific Innovation Systems approach, this study aims to identify key political issues that need to be addressed in order to develop a successful Norwegian offshore <b>wind-power</b> innovation <b>system.</b> The findings indicate a high degree of technology push, combined with a lack of demand pull. A lack of coordinated planning on an aggregate level, taking industrial as well energy concerns into consideration, is clear.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a coordinated control method for a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) -based <b>wind-power</b> generation <b>system</b> {{with a series}} grid-side converter (SGSC) under distorted grid voltage conditions. The detailed mathematical models of the DFIG system with SGSC are developed in the multiple synchronous rotating reference frames. In order to counteract the adverse effects of the voltage harmonics upon the DFIG, the SGSC generates series compensation control voltages to keep the stator voltage sinusoidal and symmetrical, which allows {{the use of the}} conventional vector control strategy for the rotor-side converter (RSC), regardless of grid voltage harmonics. Meanwhile, two control targets for the parallel grid-side converter (PGSC) are identified, including eliminating the oscillations in total active and reactive power entering the grid or suppressing the fifth- and seventh-order harmonic currents injected to the grid. Furthermore, the respective PI-R controller in the positive synchronous reference frame for the SGSC voltage control and PGSC current control have been developed to achieve precise and rapid regulation of the corresponding components. Finally, the proposed coordinated control strategy has been fully validated by the simulation results of a 2 MW DFIG-based wind turbine with SGSC under distorted grid voltage conditions...|$|R

Short-term grid disturbance and ride-through analyses were carried out for a 1. 7 -MW DFIG <b>wind-power</b> conversion <b>system.</b> Two simulation models of the wind-power DFIG were compared to reveal {{the consequences of the}} different modeling approaches for the accuracy of transient analysis. The DFIG was represented in the simulator by an analytical two-axis model with constant lumped parameters or by a finite element method-based model. The model of the generator was coupled with a model of the crowbar-protected and direct torque-controlled frequency converter, a model of the main transformer, and a simple model of the grid. In addition, a detailed model of the wind turbine was compared with a simplified model that omits the model of the mechanical part of the wind turbine. The simulator was experimentally validated by a 1. 7 -MW full-scale measurement set-up. The comparison between the simulated and measured results shows reasonable agreement. The analytical model of the DFIG, however, manifests certain drawbacks that are overcome by using a FEM model. The developed coupled field circuit-based simulator has proved to be capable and reliable for modeling of complicated power electronics and electrical machine set-ups and thus is a useful tool for the development and optimization of wind-power generators. reviewe...|$|R

Emphasis was placed on integrated systems, from input energy to hydrogen end use. Included in the PDF document are the Executive Summary of the final report and the various case studies. The activities of task 11 were focused on near- and mid-term applications, with consideration for the transition from fossil-based systems to sustainable hydrogen energy systems. The participating countries were Canada, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. In order for hydrogen to become a competitive energy carrier, experience and operating data need to be generated and collected through demonstration projects. A framework of scientific principles, technical expertise, and analytical evaluation and assessment needed to be developed to aid in the design and optimization of hydrogen demonstration projects to promote implementation. The task participants undertook research within {{the framework}} of three highly coordinated subtasks that focused on the collection and critical evaluation of data from existing demonstration projects around the world, the development and testing of computer models of hydrogen components and integrated systems, and the evaluation and comparison of hydrogen systems.
