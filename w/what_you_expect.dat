500|$|Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole was keen to win {{his first}} trophy in the final: [...] "We don't feel under any great pressure, but we do feel excited about the {{possibility}} of winning our first trophy, we've just been imagining {{what it would be like}} to lift the trophy, who's going where in the line if we win it, and how we'll run round Cardiff with it." [...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect,</b> and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{difference}} between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase [...] "Climate is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect,</b> weather {{is what you}} get." [...] Over historical time spans {{there are a number}} of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5°C (9°F) warming of the northern Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins. Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption, water retention, and rainfall on a regional level. Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global warming or global cooling. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate change are concerned.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz {{published}} a track-by-track review of each {{song on the}} album. He thought that the single did not {{fit in with the}} rest of Hell: The Sequel, but alone, is a good song, [...] " [...] track doesn't fit with EP, but Em's effortless confidence carries the celebratory anthem." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN gave a shared a similar opinion, calling the song odd and uncommon. Grischow did not favor the influences of [...] "gooey synthpop" [...] and soul fusion genres. However, the critic appreciated the [...] "inspirational verses" [...] from Eminem and Royce and summarized, [...] "In the end, this brief look at the duo's skills does not fully deliver <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect,</b> but still leaves you wanting to hear more." [...] Web magazine Plugged In Online, once a magazine that published reviews from a Conservative Christian's perspective, praised Mars' singing but harshly criticized the duo's lyricism, [...] "These two Detroit rappers use a lot more nasty words to get the job done". The reviewer, Adam Holz, went on to analyze Royce's verse, [...] "Toss in nods to toking marijuana and two allusions to oral sex, and you've got a pretty good picture of what Royce's vision of 'living out our dreams' looks like in action." [...] While exploring the Billboard charts on their segment at The A.V. Club, writers Genevieve Koski and Steven Hyden, commented on [...] "Lighters". Koski said that the single shared some similarities with [...] "Nothin' on You", which also featured Mars. Despite noticing the contrast between the rap verses and the hook, she focused her attention on the various elements of the recording which [...] "are each uplifting in their own way" [...] and awarded it a B–. On the other hand, Hyden gave the song a harsh critic calling it the, [...] "absolute worst in pop music right now". He criticized Eminem for spitting in his verses, Mars for singing a [...] "melodramatic chorus" [...] and the type of music the rapper, Eminem, was embracing dubbing it, [...] "maudlin power balladry". He gave the record an F.|$|E

2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, [...] "I don’t know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to do. You {{want me to go}} down there with a mop?" [...] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000mops to Christie in response to his comment.

2500|$|Roger Ebert {{said the}} film [...] "works and it {{delivers}} just about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> {{when you buy}} your ticket" [...] but felt that it [...] "lacks the mordant humor of the Romero version" [...] and the [...] "plot flatlines compared to the 1979 version, which was trickier, wittier and smarter." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety described it as an unnecessary remake that will appeal mostly to young adult audiences who {{have not seen the}} original film. [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film [...] "has no patience for such subtleties" [...] as Romero's thematic concerns or suspense-building. [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Snyder's blood feast is strictly by the numbers: this second-rater could be the world's most expensive Troma film." [...] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Good zombie fun, the remake of George A. Romero's [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] is the best proof in ages that cannibalizing old material sometimes works fiendishly well." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Instead, the new [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] satirizes itself and satirizes its genre, and, on its own unambitious terms, the movie succeeds. It's silly, witty and good-natured, not scary so much as icky, and not horrifying or horrible but consistently amusing." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated it [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "Commercial director Zack Snyder, making a killer feature debut, trades homemade cheesiness for knowing style, revels in the sophistication of modern special effects, and stomps off with the best remake – er, ”re-envisioning” – of a horror classic in memory." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that the remake streamlines the original film [...] "by discarding everything special about it in favor of pure visceral effect".|$|E
