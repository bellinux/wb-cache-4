500|$|The {{standard}} way {{of measuring}} rainfall or snowfall {{is the standard}} rain gauge, {{which can be found}} in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by [...] of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to [...] resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate [...] markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. Other types of gauges include the popular <b>wedge</b> <b>gauge</b> (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with.

50|$|Other {{types of}} gauges include the popular <b>wedge</b> <b>gauge</b> (the {{cheapest}} rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. The wedge and tipping bucket gauges will {{have problems with}} snow. Attempts to compensate for snow/ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success, since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing. Weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow, but again, the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins.

40|$|Differential {{structure}} of lattices {{can be defined}} if the lattices are treated as models of noncommutative geometry. The detailed construction consists of specifying a generalized Dirac operator and a <b>wedge</b> product. <b>Gauge</b> potential and field strength tensor can be defined based on this differential structure. When an inner product is specified for differential forms, classical action can be deduced for lattice gauge fields. Besides the familiar Wilson action being recovered, an additional term, related to the non-unitarity of link variables and loops spanning no area, emerges.

50|$|Angles are {{measured}} using a sine bar {{with the help}} of gauge blocks and a dial gauge or a spirit level. The aim of a measurement is to measure the surface on which the dial gauge or spirit level is placed horizontally. For example, to measure the angle of a wedge, the wedge is placed on a horizontal table. The sine bar is placed over the inclined surface of the wedge. At this position, the top surface of the sine bar is inclined the same amount as the <b>wedge.</b> Using <b>gauge</b> blocks, the top surface is made horizontal. The sine of the angle of inclination of the wedge is the ratio of the height of the gauge blocks used and the distance between the centers of the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|A {{variable}} size plot is {{more dependent}} {{of the size}} of the trees. The tract is measured on a series of points and the trees are tallied for being in or out depending on their size and location relevant to the plot center. Usually an angle <b>gauge,</b> <b>wedge</b> prism or Relascope are used to gather data for this type of plot. This allows for a very quick estimate of the volume and species of a given tract.|$|R
40|$|At present {{both the}} <b>wedge</b> <b>gauge</b> and the ICES mesh gauge {{are used to}} examine the mesh opening of trawl cod-ends. A {{thorough}} investigation of both instruments by an EU project (MESH) has revealed a number of deficiencies. This has lead to the conclusions to not further recommend the use of both devices but to go {{for the development of a}} complete new measurement tool. This is presently progressing in a further EU project named OMEGA. Prototypes of the new device have been produced and a number of introductory tests have already been made. This contribution reports on further laboratory tests carried out at the Institute for Fishing technology and Fish Quality with special emphasis on netting yarn diameters below 4 mm. The results demonstrate further yarn size depending inaccuracies of the <b>wedge</b> <b>gauge</b> and support the rapid introduction of the newly developed measurement instrument...|$|E
40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the <b>wedge</b> <b>gauge</b> are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} a scenario where gravitational dynamics {{emerges from the}} holographic hydrodynamics of some microscopic, quantum system living in a local Rindler wedge. We start by considering the area scaling properties of the entanglement entropy of a local Rindler horizon as a conceptually basic realization of the holographic principle. From the generalized second law and the Bekenstein bound we derive the gravitational dynamics via the entropy balance approach developed in [Jacobson 1995]. We show how this setting can account for the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium features associated with the gravitational dynamics and extend the thermodynamical derivation from General Relativity to generalized Brans-Dicke theories. We then concentrate on the possibility to define a version of fluid/gravity correspondence within the local Rindler wedge setting. We show how the hydrodynamical description of the horizon can be directly associated to a hydrodynamical description of the thermal fields. Because of the holographic behavior, {{the properties of the}} Rindler <b>wedge</b> thermal <b>gauge</b> theory are effectively encoded in a codimension one system living close to the Rindler horizon. In a large scale analysis, this system {{can be thought of as}} a fluid living on a codimension one stretched horizon membrane. This sets an apparent duality between the horizon local geometry and the fluid limit of the thermal gauge theory. Beyond the connection between the classical Navier-Stokes equations and a classical geometry, we discuss the possibility to realize such a duality at any point in spacetime by means of the equivalence principle. Given the shared local Rindler geometric setting, we eventually deal with the intriguing possibility to link the fluid/Rindler correspondence to the derivation of the gravitational field equations from a local non-equilibrium spacetime thermodynamics...|$|R
40|$|Photons {{and thermal}} photons are studied in Rindler's <b>Wedge</b> {{employing}} Feynman's <b>gauge</b> and canonical quantization. A Gupta-Bleuler-like formalism is explicitly implemented. Non thermal Wightman functions and related (Euclidean and Lorentzian) Green functions are explicitly calculated and their complex time analytic structure is carefully analyzed using the Fulling-Ruijsenaars "master function". The invariance {{of the advanced}} minus retarded fundamental solution is checked and a Ward identity discussed. It is suggested the KMS condition can be implemented to define thermal states also dealing with unphysical photons. Following this way, thermal Wightman functions and related (Euclidean and Lorentzian) Green functions are built up. Their analytic structure is carefully examined employing a thermal master function as in the non thermal case and other corresponding properties are discussed. Some subtleties arising dealing with unphysical photons in presence of the Rindler conical singularity are pointed out. In particular, an one-parameter class of thermal Wightman (and Schwinger) functions with the same physical content is proved to exist due to a remaining (non trivial) static gauge ambiguity. A photon version of Bisognano-Wichmann theorem is investigated {{in the case of}} photons propagating in the Rindler Wedge employing Wightman functions. Despite of the found ambiguity in defining Rindler Green functions, the coincidence of (β = 2 π) -Rindler Wightman functions and Minkowski Wightman functions is proved dealing with test functions related to physical photons and Lorentz photons...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of six aeolian dust samplers was tested via wind tunnel experiments and field measurements. In the wind tunnel, four samplers {{designed to measure}} the horizontal dust flux and one sampler designed to measure the vertical dust fur tin the downward direction, i. e., deposition) were calibrated against an isokinetic reference sampler. The horizontal dust flux samplers were: the big spring number eight sampler (BSNE), the modified Wilson and Cooke sampler (MWAC), the suspended sediment trap (SUSTRA), and the <b>wedge</b> dust flux <b>gauge</b> (WDFG). Vertical deposition flux was measured using a marble dust collector (MDCO). A modified Sartorius SM 16711 dust sampler with adjustable flow rate (SARTORIUS) was used as isokinetic reference sampler. In the field experiments, the WDFG {{was replaced by a}} Sierra ultra high volume dust sampler (SIERRA). Wind tunnel calibrations were carried out at five wind velocities ranging from 1 to 5 m s(- 1). Field calibrations were conducted during seven periods of two weeks each. The most efficient samplers are the MWAC and the SIERRA, followed by the BSNE and the SUSTRA. The WDFG is more effective than the BSNE at velocities below 3 m s(- 1), but its efficiency drops quickly at higher wind speeds. The most recommendable sampler for field measurements is the BSNE, because its efficiency varies only very slightly with wind speed. In the absence of horizontal flux samplers, the MDCO collector can be used as an alternative to assess horizontal dust flux and airborne dust concentration provided the appropriate calibrations are made.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The ASAE {{standardized}} tool {{to detect}} the depth and strength of compaction layers {{in the field is}} the cone penetrometer. Since this method is point-to-point, researchers have experimented with on-the-fly alternatives that can be used as, or in combination with, a standard tillage tool. On-the-fly compaction layer sensing also enables adaptive tillage, where the soil is only tilled as deep as necessary, which can lead to significant energy savings and erosion reduction. <b>Wedged</b> tips, strain <b>gauges</b> mounted on a deflecting tine, air bubbles pushed into the soil, as well as ground-penetrating radar have been tested for this purpose. In this research, passive acoustics was used {{to detect the}} compaction layer by recording the sound of a cone being drawn through the soil. The premise was that a more compacted layer should cause higher sound levels, which might reveal the depth and strength of the compaction layer. Two experiments were conducted in the soil bins of the USDA-ARS National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn, Alabama. First, constant-depth tests (15 and 30 cm) at three compaction levels (0. 72, 2. 8, and 3. 6 MPa) revealed the relationship of sound amplitude with depth and compaction. Second, to test the detection capability, the cone was gradually inserted in the soil, passing through an artificial compaction layer. A windowed, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis showed that the compaction layer is detectable since the sound amplitude was positively related to depth and compaction levels, but only in the highest frequency range of the spectrum. This led to the conjecture that the soil-cone interface acts as a low-pass filtering mechanism, where the cutoff frequency becomes higher in the compaction layer due to a more intimate contact between sensor and soil...|$|R
