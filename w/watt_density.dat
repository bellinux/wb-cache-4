The most common type of metal alloy used for this purpose is a Nickel-Chromium mixture, also known as Nichrome. the Nichrome wire is wound around a ceramic core, and the number of spirals per inch vary according to the requested <b>watt</b> <b>density.</b> Potential from an alternating current source, which can either be 2 phase or 3 phase, flows through the coiled Nichrome wire, heating up the wire, which in turn, heats the cartridge heater sheath.|$|E

40|$|The {{immediate}} {{effects of}} carbon dioxide laser radiation were assessed in the normal canine aorta, the human atherosclerotic aorta, and 24 human coronary arteries from nine cadaver hearts. The parameters needed for precise control of laser energy were identified.

Use of an optimal pulse duration (30 msec or less) resulted in less thermal injury to the adjacent arterial wall. Laser radiation relieved stenosis and reopened totally occluded vessels in 21 of 24 coronary arteries. Coronary stenoses were not relieved in two heavily calcified arteries, and perforation occurred in another artery. In successfully treated arteries, laser coronary endarterectomy increased the luminal diameter from 25 to 100 %...|$|R
50|$|This heating {{technology}} {{is used in}} some expensive infrared saunas. It {{is also found in}} space heaters. These heaters use low <b>watt</b> <b>density</b> ceramic emitters (usually fairly big panels) which emit long wave infrared radiation. Because the heating elements are at a relatively low temperature, far-infrared heaters do not give emissions and smell from dust, dirt, formaldehyde, toxic fumes from paint-coating, etc. This has made this type of space heating very popular among people with severe allergies and multiple chemical sensitivity in Europe. Because far infrared technology does not heat the air of the room directly, it is important to maximize the exposure of available surfaces which then re-emit the warmth to provide an even all round ambient warmth.|$|E
40|$|A vacuum {{thermoforming}} machine works by heating a clamped polymer sheet and then engaging the tooling {{to form the}} desired shape when the plastic is at the proper temperature. The current {{vacuum thermoforming}} machine in the Trine University Plastics Lab possesses a single top‐side heater. With the current setup, thicker materials will be scorched on the material’s top side and while the bottom side is not heated enough. In order for thicker materials {{to be used by}} the machine and heated effectively, a second bottom‐side heater is needed. Since an off the shelf solution is not feasible, the second heater must be designed and fabricated. Before fabrication of the secondary thermoforming heater, several analyses were conducted to ensure that the heater would function within the necessary operating parameters. Using thermal simulation software, the designed heater enclosure box was tested to ensure that the correct thermal flow was provided as needed. Material properties were then applied to the CAD files and finite element analysis software was used to ensure that the new heating enclosure and track system would be structurally sound. Although variations of the heating enclosure setup were taken into account as part of these analyses, the results favored mirroring the existing heater layout with some adjustments. Instead of sixteen individual horizontal coils like in the top heater, three coils with three bends each were used. Testing showed that the same <b>watt</b> <b>density</b> could be achieved with only three coils using this design. The new heater was also made thinner in order to allow for more space for the mold. The heater tray was insulated {{in order to protect the}} mold which rests underneath and also for safety purposes.

40|$|Background: Bacterial agents {{found in}} the airways of {{hospitals}} and medical centers can be very harmful. In this study, microwave radiation was employed in order to remove Pseudomonas aeruginosa from hospital air. Materials and Methods: Microwave radiation power of 180, 360 and 540 W was used. The bacterial strain used was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). Bacterial aerosols {{in the range of}} 107 and 106 of bacteria per ml of air, which was prepared using a nebulizer, was injected into the system. Results: The results of this study showed that the number of bacteria remaining in the system decreased with increasing microwave power.

IOP Publishing Ltd is not responsible for any errors or omissions in {{this version of the}} manuscript or any version derived from it. The Version of Record is available online at [URL] Dielectric Barrier Discharges (S-DBDs) have received renewed attention in recent years for their potential application in emerging biomedical, environmental and agricultural applications. In most of these applications, the plasma is not in direct contact with the substrate being treated and the transport of reactive species from the plasma to the substrate is typically assumed to be controlled by diffusion. Here, we demonstrate that generally {{this is not the case}} and that electrohydrodynamic (EHD) forces can produce jets that enhance the delivery of these species, thereby influencing the efficacy of the S-DBD device. In particular, we have studied the degradation of potassium indigotrisulfonate solutions exposed to S-DBDs generated in devices with annular electrodes of diameters varying between 10 mm and 50 mm. All the devices were driven at constant linear power <b>density</b> (<b>Watts</b> per cm of plasma length) and although local plasma properties remained the same in all the devices, a three-fold efficacy enhancement was observed for devices of diameter 30 mm due to EHD effects...|$|R
5000|$|When making {{transmission}} measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively {{compares the}} fraction of light that passes through a reference solution and a test solution, then electronically compares the intensities of the two signals and computes the percentage of transmission of the sample compared to the reference standard. For reflectance measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares {{the fraction of}} light that reflects from the reference and test samples. Light from the source lamp is passed through a monochromator, which diffracts the light into a [...] "rainbow" [...] of wavelengths through a rotating prism and outputs narrow bandwidths of this diffracted spectrum through a mechanical slit on the output side of the monochromator. These bandwidths are transmitted through the test sample. Then the photon flux <b>density</b> (<b>watts</b> per metre squared usually) of the transmitted or reflected light is measured with a photodiode, charge coupled device or other light sensor. The transmittance or reflectance value for each wavelength of the test sample is then compared with the transmission or reflectance values from the reference sample. Most instruments will apply a logarithmic function to the linear transmittance ratio to calculate the 'absorbency' of the sample, a value which {{is proportional to the}} 'concentration' of the chemical being measured.|$|R
40|$|We {{have tested}} the first diamond double-crystal {{monochromator}} at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The monochromator {{consisted of two}} synthetic type lb (111) diamond plates in symmetric Bragg geometry. We tested two pairs of single-crystal plates: the first pair was 6 mm by 5 mm by 0. 25 mm and 6 mm by 5 mm by 0. 37 mm; the second set was 7 mm by 5. 5 mm by 0. 44 mm. The monochromator first crystal was indirectly cooled by edge contact with a water-cooled copper holder. We studied {{the performance of the}} monochromator under the high-power x-ray beam delivered by the APS undulator A. We found no indication of thermal distortions or strains even at the highest incident power (280 <b>watts)</b> and power <b>density</b> (123 W/mm{sup 2 } at normal incidence). The calculated maximum power and power density absorbed by the first crystal were 37 watts and 16 W/mm{sup 2 } respectively. We also compared the maximum intensity delivered by the diamond monochromator and by a silicon (111) cryogenically cooled monochromator. For energies in the range of 6 to 10 keV, the flux through the diamond monochromator was about a factor of two less than through the silicon monochromator, in good agreement with calculations. We conclude that water-cooled diamond monochromators can handle the high-power beams from the undulator beams from the undulator beamlines at the APS. As single-crystal diamond plates of larger size and better quality become available, the use of diamond monochromators will become a very attractive option...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Comparative Analysis of Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and Power Transmission Lines Effects on the Human Body in Lagos Environs. This was achieved using the measured and calculated values of some electromagnetic parameters such as power density, and electric field intensity. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) exposure limit for BTS antennas is 0. 1 W/m 2 (100 mw/m 2). For values of radiating {{power of the}} base station antenna ranging between 33 Watts to 100 <b>Watts,</b> the power <b>density</b> experienced {{in the vicinity of}} the antenna ranges from 0. 8 mW/m 2 to 280 mW/m 2. The health effect of the antennas is at its peak when the base station antenna is transmitting at 100 Watts. At radiating power of 100 Watts, the mean power density was found to be 39 mW/m 2, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value was 73 mW/m 2. The distance away from the base station that is safe for residential purposes was found to be 16. m. The safety guideline by ICNIRP for exposure to overhead high voltage power line is 10 kv/m, the electric field around the power line ranges from 0. 016 KV/m to 0. 46 KV/m. The mean electric field was found to be 0. 056 KV/m, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value was 0. 12 KV/m. The highest value of electric field intensity measured in the vicinity of an overhead power line was found to be far below ICNIRP limit of exposure. The results obtained in this research can help in the proper town planning and allocation of land space for residential and commercial purposes, so as to reduce the number of health hazard related to electromagnetic radiation from these two common sources. Also, the health risks associated with exposure t...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityMany-core systems, {{ranging from}} {{small-scale}} many-core processors to large-scale high performance computing (HPC) data centers, {{have become the}} main trend in computing system design owing to their potential to deliver higher throughput per <b>watt.</b> However, power <b>densities</b> and temperatures increase following {{the growth in the}} performance capacity, and bring major challenges in energy efficiency, cooling costs, and reliability. These challenges require a joint assessment of performance, power, and temperature tradeoffs as well as the design of runtime optimization techniques that monitor and manage the interplay among them. This thesis proposes novel modeling and runtime management techniques that evaluate and optimize the performance, energy, and reliability of many-core systems. We first address the energy and thermal challenges in 3 D-stacked many-core processors. 3 D processors with stacked DRAM have the potential to dramatically improve performance owing to lower memory access latency and higher bandwidth. However, the performance increase may cause 3 D systems to exceed the power budgets or create thermal hot spots. In order to provide an accurate analysis and enable the design of efficient management policies, this thesis introduces a simulation framework to jointly analyze performance, power, and temperature for 3 D systems. We then propose a runtime optimization policy that maximizes the system performance by characterizing the application behavior and predicting the operating points that satisfy the power and thermal constraints. Our policy reduces the energy-delay product (EDP) by up to 61. 9 % compared to existing strategies. Performance, cooling energy, and reliability are also critical aspects in HPC data centers. In addition to causing reliability degradation, high temperatures increase the required cooling energy. Communication cost, on the other hand, has a significant impact on system performance in HPC data centers. This thesis proposes a topology-aware technique that maximizes system reliability by selecting between workload clustering and balancing. Our policy improves the system reliability by up to 123. 3 % compared to existing temperature balancing approaches. We also introduce a job allocation methodology to simultaneously optimize the communication cost and the cooling energy in a data center. Our policy reduces the cooling cost by 40 % compared to cooling-aware and performance-aware policies, while achieving comparable performance to performance-aware policy...|$|R
