500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The London Free Press listed {{it as one}} of the [...] "best bets" [...] {{to watch}} the evening it originally aired. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the small-town government setting and story lines of the show were working, but felt the writing for the Leslie character has been uneven and that individual situations involving her in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were not funny or effective. Matt Fowler of IGN said the Leslie character was funny, particularly <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about her failure to remove graffiti penises from a city wall. ("To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.") But Fowler said the Scrabble subplot between Tom and Ron was [...] "silly," [...] and said the Ron character is too one-note and unfunny.|$|E
500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really funny how little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, so <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Ellen Stokes is a loving wife and mother, but she has one fault - extravagance. On the day that her only child is playing the host at a birthday party, Ellen's husband informs her that he is practically ruined, and places the fault at her door. Ellen, conscience stricken, declares that she will aid her husband, and tells him that she will induce her rich uncle to aid them. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> {{to him on the}} subject, she finds that he is not disposed to aid her. Soon after his refusal, a friend of the family drops in, finds Ellen in tears, learns of her trouble, and offers a loan which she finally accepts. The woman's husband is of a jealous nature and when Ellen gives him the money, he asks if it came from the other man. She hastily denies it, and says that her uncle was the one. The husband takes the money, and later finds that his wife has deceived him. In anger he leaves the house, taking their only child with him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{clerk in}} the book-department that died from asphyxiation--I {{wonder if it}} was accident, after all. They said so, {{but she was so}} unhappy and all <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> to me at lunch.|$|R
6000|$|... "The bridge {{challenges}} Mother Gunga," [...] said Peroo, with a laugh. [...] "But <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> I {{know whose}} voice {{will be the}} loudest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{fumigated}} herself first so as {{to escape}} infection," [...] said the husband. [...] "You should hear Gerard Maule imitate her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about the filthy priest." ...|$|E
60|$|There she stands-painted by herself. No witness but {{herself has}} been allowed to testify. She stands there painted by her acts, and {{decorated}} by her words. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks,</b> she has only a decorative value as a witness, either for or against herself, for she deals mainly in unsupported assertion; and in the rare cases where she puts forward a verifiable fact she gets out of it a meaning which it refuses to furnish to anybody else. Also, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks,</b> she is unstable, she wanders, she is incurably inconsistent; what she says to-day she contradicts tomorrow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How should I know? Didst thou not--no, {{that was}} after the Army rose {{out of the earth}} and took thee away. I abode there in {{meditation}} in a room against the dovecot--except <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> eternally.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A little edged tool,' said Miss Fennimore, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> {{her over}} {{afterwards}} with Phoebe. 'I wish I {{could have been}} with her at Lady Bannerman's. It is an unsafe age {{for a glimpse of}} the world.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Spencer," [...] {{said the}} Old Lady graciously--she always spoke very graciously to her inferiors <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> {{to them at}} all--"can {{you tell me the}} name of the new music teacher who is {{boarding}} at Mr. William Spencer's?" ...|$|R

"Jeekie," [...] said Alan {{after their}} food {{had been brought}} to them, this time, he observed, by men, for it was now past midday, [...] "you were born in Asiki-land; tell me the truth of this business. What does that woman mean <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about her spirit having been here from the beginning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "You know, mother, I {{think there}} must be {{something}} the matter with me, that I CAN'T love. When she's there, as a rule, I DO love her. Sometimes, when I see her just as THE WOMAN, I love her, mother; but then, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> and criticises, I often don't listen to her." ...|$|E

50|$|Her {{counselor}} eventually arranges {{for her to}} have recess {{with the}} younger kids. She meets a boy named Michael, who is strangely sad over his mother. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> to her counselor about it, she told Caitlin that {{he was the son of}} the teacher that was shot.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> over {{affairs with}} her tearful mother, Mrs. Golden always ended by suggesting, [...] "I wonder if perhaps you couldn't {{go back to}} school-teaching again. Everybody said you were so successful. And maybe I could get some {{needlework}} to do. I do want to help so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a blow to}} me. I {{had always}} looked on Pamela as a well-drawn character, and a very attractive, {{kittenish}} little thing at that. That scene {{between her and the}} curate in the conservatory ... And <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> to Arthur at the meet of the Blankshires ... I was sorry she did not like Pamela. Somehow it lowered Pamela in my estimation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{see much}} of Miss Haldane," [...] said Cotton, as we rode on together. [...] "Of course, she's the {{embodiment}} of all a woman of that kind should be; but I can't help feeling it's a hospitable duty <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> to me. You see I've forgotten most of the little I used to know, and she is, with all respect, uncomfortably superior to an average individual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I {{say that}} I, for one, never {{believed}} that rubbish?" [...] retorted Irma sullenly; [...] "and haven't I preached {{to her about}} it these past two years? But you needn't be afraid," [...] she added, as she turned once more to her stewing-pot, [...] "she didn't hear what I said. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> or sings to her father you might shoot off a cannon--she wouldn't hear it. You may say what you like just now, BÃ©la, she'll not listen." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a little}} more than a week after Edna's {{adventure}} in the Gardens, and about ten o'clock in the morning, that something happened--something which proved that Mrs. Cliff was entirely right <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> about the feeling in her bones. Edna received a letter from Captain Horn, which was dated at Marseilles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm sure I do,' said he. 'If I fail I {{shall be}} unhappy, and if I succeed I shall be equally so. I shall set {{all the world}} against me.

6000|$|... "He didn't seem to {{lose his}} temper a little bit, even <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> the most, but kept on trying to soothe her {{by saying that the}} only trouble we'd ever had in the big woods among {{ourselves}} had been caused by Jimmy Hedgehog, but we'd hear nothing more of that kind after his plan had been worked out.|$|R
6000|$|I {{managed to}} get a few minutes with the Hopgoods. We talked of Pasiance sitting in the kitchen under a row of plates, with that {{clinging}} smell of wood-smoke, bacon, and age bringing up memories, as nothing but scents can. The dear old lady's hair, drawn so nicely down her forehead on each side from the centre of her cap, has a few thin silver lines; and her face is a thought more wrinkled. The tears still come into her eyes <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> of her [...] "lamb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something like this--you {{were at the}} Hall with Geoffrey {{when the}} townspeople were clamoring about Sir Gilbert's closing the path through the wood, {{and for some reason}} you {{assisted}} them in attacking the barricade. It had been well tarred as a defensive measure, hadn't it? Then you returned, triumphant, black from head to foot, when you thought the guests had gone, and plunged {{into the middle of the}} last of them--Maud always laughs <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> about it. Sir Gilbert was somewhere out of sight when you related the rabble's brilliant victory, but he dashed out red in face when he understood and never stopped until he jumped into his motor. I don't think Geoffrey's wife has forgiven you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! yes! She {{is waiting}} in the carriage. We are careful not to excite {{attention}} {{at the door of}} the hotel; the coachman will drive up and down the street till I want him again. Never mind that! I have something to say to you about Fanny. She thinks of her own troubles, poor soul, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> to me, and exaggerates a little without meaning it. I hope she has not misled you in speaking of her master. It is base and bad of him, unworthy of a gentleman, to be jealous--and he has wounded me deeply. But dear Hugh, his jealousy is a gentle jealousy. I have heard of other men who watch their wives--who have lost all confidence in them--who would even have taken away from me such a trifle as this." [...] She smiled, and showed to Mountjoy her duplicate key of the cottage door. [...] "Ah, Harry is above such degrading distrust as that! There are times when he is as heartily ashamed of his own weakness as I could wish him to be. I have seen him on his knees before me, shocked at his conduct. He is no hypocrite. Indeed, his repentance is sincere, while it lasts--only it doesn't last! His jealousy rises and falls, like the wind. He said last night (when the wind was high): 'If you wish to make me the happiest creature on the face of the earth, don't encourage Mr. Mountjoy to remain in Paris!' Try to make allowances for him!" ...|$|E
60|$|The lady {{understood}} it better; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> {{it over with}} her husband in the evening, they were convinced the cause of his trouble must be some unfortunate attachment, which he might think it his duty to overcome; and having settled this, they became very fond of him, and anxious to make Redclyffe agreeable to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I entirely {{disagree}} with you," [...] exclaimed Mary. She was somehow always {{out of breath}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked.</b> And her speech was punctuated by little gasps.

5000|$|... "The Follow-Up Interview" [...] {{is written}} by Dan Vado and drawn by Drew Rausch. This short piece is a {{continuation}} of last issues [...] "The Interview".

6000|$|I {{am trying}} to {{conceive}} what were the thoughts of the young husband {{on the other side}} of the street. [...] "If the barrier is to be crossed to-night may I not go with her?

60|$|Sophy argued vehemently against this, {{and poor}} grandmamma, who had with {{difficulty}} been taught worldly wisdom as a duty, and always thought herself good <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> prudently, began to cry.

6000|$|... "I hardly know, mother; {{she seemed}} to be so much older than I am.
