25|$|National glory {{returned}} in 2002–03 when Bayern achieved its fourth double {{by winning the}} Bundesliga with the second largest gap ever to the runner-up and a straight 3–1 win over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the cup final. However, the whole season was overshadowed by Bayern's unceremonious exit from the Champions League in the first group stage, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single win in six matches. The following season, the team, enhanced with the €19 million acquisition of Dutch striker Roy Makaay from Deportivo de La Coruña, overcame at least this hurdle, but even an underperforming Real Madrid in crisis managed to eliminate the Reds in the round of 16. Bayern itself was not reaching any consistent form all year and even the formerly sturdy defence proved highly vulnerable. In the end, the club's second-placed finish in the league was not descriptive of Bayern's strength but rather of inconsistent performances by its competitors. The cup elimination by second division Alemannia Aachen was symptomatic for a season in which the team showed not a single convincing performance. Even the newcomers Michael Ballack and 2002 World Cup-winning defender Lúcio could not make a difference.|$|E
2500|$|Melody Makers Steve Sutherland also {{welcomed the}} new musical direction: [...] "The Banshees achieve an awesome, {{effective}} new pop <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> theory or qualm. Dreamhouse is an intoxicating achievement". Critic David Cleary of AllMusic would later describe the single [...] "Slowdive" [...] as [...] "a violin-colored dance beat number", with [...] "a catchy melodic hook {{away from being}} the real thing", and positively assessed the album, saying, [...] "This fine platter is well worth purchasing".|$|E
2500|$|David Bentley Hart, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} the Christian journal First Things, interpreted the book as a [...] "rollicking burlesque, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pretense of logical order or scholarly rigor". Hart says [...] "On matters of simple historical and textual fact, moreover, Hitchens' book is so extraordinarily crowded with errors that one soon gives up counting them." [...] Hart notes that Hitchens conflates the histories of the 1st and 4th crusades, restates the long discredited assertion that the early church destroyed ancient pagan texts, and asserts that Myles Coverdale and John Wycliffe were burned alive when both men died of old age.|$|E

2500|$|Some general {{criticism}} of financial derivatives is also relevant to credit derivatives. [...] Warren Buffett famously described derivatives bought speculatively as [...] "financial {{weapons of mass}} destruction." [...] In Berkshire Hathaway's annual report to shareholders in 2002, he said, [...] "Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses—often huge in amount—in their current earnings statements <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> penny changing hands. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The brotherhood of the Tau Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa {{underwent}} a great transition {{in the years}} of World War II and immediately afterward. [...] Many members of the classes of 1942 through 1945 were rushed through their academic studies {{and went off to}} war <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> graduation ceremony. [...] At the same time, the U.S. Navy organized a V-12 Navy College Training Program on the Dartmouth College campus. [...] Many Phi Sigma Kappa men from Dartmouth went off to war, and at least one spent time as a prisoner of war. When these same brothers returned to finish their education after the war, attitudes in the house were less innocent, which changed how the brotherhood treated one another. [...] Certain pre-war pledge activities, for example, were completely eliminated, as their shock value no longer entertained anyone.|$|E
60|$|And <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{glance at}} Betty he bowed low to Lydia and then strode {{out of the}} open door.|$|E

60|$|Psmith, meanwhile, was not enjoying himself. It was an unheard-of thing, he said, depriving {{a man of}} his {{confidential}} secretary <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{asking his}} leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{politician}} from Newcastle," [...] answered Mr. Crewe, {{continuing to}} tap the trees, and <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> glance at Alice.|$|E
6000|$|... "C-callate to git the steeple {{done before}} frost?" [...] inquired Jethro, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> smile. [...] "B-build it tight, Jock--b-build it tight." ...|$|E
60|$|But now Wash Crosby {{showed his}} hand. <b>Without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> toot of the whistle, his steam launch kept drawing {{closer and closer}} to Jerry's side.|$|E

60|$|Lionel {{drew his}} purse {{from his pocket}} and <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> looking into its {{contents}} dropped it into the seaman's ready hand, with a muttered word of thanks.|$|R
60|$|And then, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{finishing}} his third glass, far less {{waiting for the}} other two, he bade us good-bye and went forth, under the lamp of the hotel, into the black night.|$|R
60|$|Kelley, silenced, {{and with}} a feeling that he had bungled his job, fell back a pace, while she drove away <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{backward}} glance.|$|E
60|$|The club fell {{squarely}} on the brute's head, crushing the skull {{as if it had}} been an egg-shell, and <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> moan the dog dropped dead.|$|E
60|$|And Michael, {{straining}} at the rope, went by, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wag of tail to Steward or {{a glance}} of eye. The officers stopped before Daughtry and drew Michael {{back into the}} group.|$|E
60|$|This {{order was}} obeyed, {{and the little}} troop watched the {{messenger}} {{as he approached the}} colonel, and, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> touching his cap by way of salute, spoke earnestly during a few seconds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} ain't goin' to refuse {{us a chance}} to give you a lift," [...] the red-nosed man said in a whining tone; and Bob replied, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> looking at his guests: ...|$|R

60|$|At {{last they}} came to a great wide plain, where, far or near, nothing was to be seen but bare sand, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pebble or a single blade of grass, and there night caught up with them.|$|E
60|$|The little maid and {{the little}} woman had {{apparently}} conceived a most violent admiration each for the other, and straightway {{it seemed as if}} the boys were entirely forgotten, for the two went into the house <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> backward glance.|$|E

6000|$|Bax paused {{as if to}} consider, then he said: [...] "Suppose, now, that I were to go off {{suddenly}} to some far {{part of the world}} for many years <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> saying good-bye to ye, what would you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should have}} armed ourselves," [...] grumbled Slogwell Brown. [...] "It {{was a mistake}} to come over to this island <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pistol. If I only had some sort of a weapon, I'd show those boys a thing or two." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{followed}} {{at a little}} distance, and thus we traveled the ten miles back to the ranch. When we reached the corrals she dismounted and, turning her horse over to Dick, she went off toward the house <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nod or good-by to me.|$|E

60|$|So in {{went the}} beggar, {{and the first}} loaf of bread he laid his hand upon was {{the one in which}} the money was hidden, and off he marched with it under his arm, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> saying thank you.|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} he motioned me to precede him. Silently I pressed Fra Gervasio's hand, and on that {{departed}} <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> another look at my mother, who sat there a silent witness of a scene which she approved.|$|R
