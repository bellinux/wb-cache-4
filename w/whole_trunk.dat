60|$|We are {{struggling}} now among the Gennargentu spurs. There {{is no single}} peak--no Etna of Sardinia. The train, like the plough, balances on the steep, steep sides of the hill-spurs, and winds around and around. Above and below the steep slopes are all bosky. These are the woods of Gennargentu. But they aren't woods in my sense of the word. They are thin sprinkles of oaks and chestnuts and cork-trees over steep hill-slopes. And cork-trees! I see curious slim oaky-looking trees that are stripped quite naked below the boughs, standing brown-ruddy, curiously distinct among the bluey grey pallor of the others. They remind me, again and again, of glowing, coffee-brown, naked aborigines of the South Seas. They have the naked suavity, skin-bare, and an intense coffee-red colour of unclothed savages. And these are the stripped cork-trees. Some are much stripped, some little.

There was none of that white sleek skin and shimmering play of sinew which made Wilson a beautiful picture, but in its stead there was a rugged grandeur of knotted and tangled muscle, as though the roots of some old tree were writhing from breast to shoulder, and from shoulder to elbow. Even in repose the sun threw shadows from the curves of his skin, but when he exerted himself every muscle bunched itself up, distinct and hard, breaking his <b>whole</b> <b>trunk</b> into gnarled knots of sinew. His skin, on face and body, was darker and harsher than that of his youthful antagonist, but he looked tougher and harder, an effect which was increased by the sombre colour of his stockings and breeches. He entered the ring, sucking a lemon, with Jim Belcher and Caleb Baldwin, the coster, at his heels. Strolling across to the post, he tied his blue bird's-eye handkerchief over the west- countryman's yellow, and then walked to his opponent with his hand out.|$|E

30|$|In our research, the distally-based sural neuro-veno-fasciocutaneous flap was pedicled {{with the}} {{nutrient}} arteries of the lateral sural nerve and the lesser saphenous vein originating from the superficial sural artery and the musculocutaneous perforators of the {{posterior tibial artery}} {{as well as the}} interseptum perforators of the downward peroneal artery. These formed chain-linked vascular plexuses by connecting with each other and the anastomosis of the vascular networks from the superficial fascia, deep fascia and subdermis. There are abundant communicating branches between these vascular networks, meaning that the arteries to nerves, veins, fascia, and skin share a common origin, thus forming a multisegmental vascular plexus along the <b>whole</b> nerve <b>trunk</b> with ample blood supply.

6000|$|... § 9. In {{the next}} three {{examples}} we have instances of endeavors at finish by the hands of artists themselves, marking three stages of knowledge or insight, and three relative stages of finish. Fig. 7. is Claude's (Liber Veritatis, No. 140., facsimile by Boydell). It still displays an appalling ignorance of the forms of trees, but yet is, in mode of execution, better--that is, more finished--than the engravings, because not altogether mechanical, and showing some dim, far-away, blundering memory of a few facts in stems, such as their variations of texture and roundness, and bits of young shoots of leaves. 8. is Salvator's, facsimiled from part of his original etching of the Finding of Oedipus. It displays considerable power of handling--not mechanical, but free and firm, and is just so much more finished {{than any of the}} others as it displays more intelligence about the way in which boughs gather themselves out of the stem, and about the varying character of their curves. Finally, fig. 9. is good work. It is the root of the apple-tree in Albert Durer's Adam and Eve, and fairly represents the wrinkles of the bark, the smooth portions emergent beneath, and the general anatomy of growth. All the lines used conduce to the representation of these facts; and the work is therefore highly finished. It still, however, leaves out, as not to be represented by such kind of lines, the more delicate gradations of light and shade. I shall now [...] "finish" [...] a little farther, in the next plate (3.), the mere insertion of the two boughs outlined in fig. 1. I do this simply by adding assertions of more facts. First, I say that the <b>whole</b> <b>trunk</b> is dark, as compared with the distant sky. Secondly, I say that it is rounded by gradations of shadow, in the various forms shown. And, lastly, I say that (this being a bit of old pine stripped by storm of its bark) the wood is fissured in certain directions, showing its grain, or muscle, seen in complicated contortions at the insertion of the arm and elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|When sago {{is to be}} made, a full-grown tree is {{selected}} just before {{it is going to}} flower. It is cut down close to the ground, the leaves and leafstalks cleared away, and a broad strip of the bark taken off the upper side of the trunk. This exposes the pithy matter, which is of a rusty colour {{near the bottom of the}} tree, but higher up pure white, about as hard as a dry apple, but with woody fibre running through it about a quarter of an inch apart. This pith is cut or broken down into a coarse powder by means of a tool constructed for the purpose--a club of hard and heavy wood, having a piece of sharp quartz rock firmly imbedded into its blunt end, and projecting about half an inch. By successive blows of this, narrow strips of the pith are cut away, and fall down into the cylinder formed by the bark. Proceeding steadily on, the <b>whole</b> <b>trunk</b> is cleared out, leaving a skin not more than half an inch in thickness. This material is carried away (in baskets made of the sheathing bases of the leaves) to the nearest water, where a washing-machine is put up, which is composed almost entirely of the saga tree itself. The large sheathing bases of the leaves form the troughs, and the fibrous covering from the leaf-stalks of the young cocoa-nut the strainer. Water is poured on the mass of pith, which is kneaded and pressed against the strainer till the starch is all dissolved and has passed through, when the fibrous refuse is thrown away, and a fresh basketful put in its place. The water charged with sago starch passes on to a trough, with a depression in the centre, where the sediment is deposited, the surplus water trickling off by a shallow outlet. When the trough is nearly full, the mass of starch, which has a slight reddish tinge, is made into cylinders of about thirty pounds' weight, and neatly covered with sago leaves, and in this state is sold as raw sago.|$|E

In addition, in both men and women, BMI and WC demonstrated similar abilities to distinguish between participants with and without the metabolic syndrome in comparison with corresponding DXA measurements.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{movement}} of the upper limbs (eg fidgeting-like activities) is a meaningful component of nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). This study {{examined the relationship between}} upper limb movements and <b>whole</b> body <b>trunk</b> movements, by simultaneously measuring energy expenditure {{during the course of the}} day. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study consisting of 88 subjects with a wide range in body mass index (17. 3 - 32. 5 kg/m(2)). The energy expenditure over a 24 -h period was measured in a large respiratory chamber. The body movements were assessed by two uniaxial-accelerometers during daytime, one on the waist and the other on the dominant arm. The accelerometry scores from level 0 (=immobile) up to level 9 (=maximal intensity) were recorded. The activities of subjects were classified into eight categories: walking at two speeds on a horizontal treadmill (A & B), ambling (C), self-care tasks (D), desk work (E), meals (F), reading (G), watching TV (H). RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between the accelerometry scores from the waist (ACwaist) and that from the wrist (ACwrist) over the daytime period (R(2) = 0. 64; P< 0. 001). The ACwrist was systematically higher than the ACwaist during sedentary activities, whereas it was the reverse for walking activities. ACwrist to ACwaist ratio of activities E-H were above 1. 0 and for walking activities (A-C) were below 1. 0. A multiple regression analysis for predicting daytime energy expenditure revealed that the explained variance improved by 2 % only when the ACwrist was added as a second predictor in addition to the ACwaist. This indicates that the effect of the ACwrist for predicting energy expenditure was of limited importance in our conditions of measurement. CONCLUSIONS: The acceleration of the upper limbs which includes fidgeting is more elevated than that of the whole body for sitting/lying down activities. However, their contribution to energy expenditure is lower than <b>whole</b> body <b>trunk</b> movements, thus indicating that the weight-bearing locomotion activities may be a key component of NEAT. However, its contribution may depend on the total duration of the upper limb movements during the course of the day...|$|R

5000|$|All of Oken's {{writings}} are deductive {{illustrations of}} an assumed principle, which, with other philosophers of the transcendental school, he deemed {{equal to the}} explanation of all the mysteries of nature. According to him, the head was a repetition of the trunk—a kind of second trunk, with its limbs and other appendages; this sum of his observations and comparisons—few of which he ever gave in detail—ought always to be borne in mind in comparing the share taken by Oken in homological anatomy with the progress made by other cultivators of that philosophical branch of the science. The idea of the analogy between the skull, or parts of the skull, and the vertebral column had been previously propounded and ventilated in their lectures by Johann von Autenrieth (1772-1835) and Carl Kielmeyer (1765-1844), and {{in the writings of}} Johann Frank (1745-1821). By Oken it was applied chiefly in illustration of the mystical system of Schelling—the [...] "all-in-all" [...] and [...] "all-in-every-part." [...] From the earliest to the latest of Oken's writings on the subject, [...] "the head is a repetition of the <b>whole</b> <b>trunk</b> with all its systems: the brain is the spinal cord; the cranium is the vertebral column; the mouth is intestine and abdomen; the nose is the lungs and thorax; the jaws are the limbs; and the teeth the claws or nails." [...] Johann von Spix (1781-1826) in his folio Cephalogenesis (1818), richly illustrated comparative craniology, but presented the facts under the same transcendental guise; and Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) availed himself of the extravagances of these disciples of Schelling to cast ridicule on the whole inquiry into those higher relations of parts to the archetype which Sir Richard Owen (1804-1892) called [...] "general homologies." ...|$|E

50|$|Designed in the Adirondack style by Harrison G. Wiseman {{and built}} by George Locke of Bridgton, the theatre was {{constructed}} of rose hemlock harvested on the property. The proscenium arch {{was made from}} <b>whole</b> tree <b>trunks</b> and the beams, doors, trim, and light fixtures were all handcarved.

Two large barn doors located behind the stage could be opened for an authentic forest backdrop. Whether by chance or design, the theatre also had near perfect acoustics. More than sixty years after the theatre first opened, Christopher Hyde, classical music critic for the Maine Sunday Telegram, theorized that the tight sheathing of rough hemlock and pre-stressed posts and beams created {{the effect of a}} large stringed instrument able to transmit vibrations efficiently without echoes or reverberation.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} lignin analyses {{were carried out}} on material from the trunks of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) trees. Two types of material were analyzed. First, <b>whole</b> birch <b>trunk</b> pieces were cryosectioned into cork cambium, non-conductive phloem, the cambial zone (conductive phloem, cambium and differentiating xylem), lignified xylem and the previous year’s xylem; material that would show differences in lignin amount and quality. Second, clonal material from one natural birch population was analyzed to show variations between individuals and between the lignin analysis methods. The different tissues showed marked differences in lignin amount and the syringyl:guaiacyl (S/G) ratio. In the non-conductive phloem tissue containing sclereids, the S/G ratio was very low, and typical for phloem fibers and in the newly-formed xylem, {{as well as in}} the previous year’s xylem, the ratio lay between five and seven, typical for broadleaf tree xylem. Clonal material consisting of 88 stems was used to calculate the S/G ratios from the thioacidolysis and CuO methods, which correlated positively with an R 2 value of 0. 43. Comparisons of the methods indicate clearly that the CuO method is a good alternative to study the monomeric composition and S/G ratio of wood lignins...|$|R

For the three clones, rubber production correlated with the estimated latex regeneration area. It took around 100 cm 2 of latex regeneration area to regenerate 1 g of rubber. As it assesses the impact of any tapping system on <b>whole</b> <b>trunk</b> latex physiology, the LDM method was used to develop new tapping systems, such as systems involving ethylene gas stimulation, micro-tapping cut systems, and multi-tapping cut systems...|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Efteling {{began to}} build an {{interactive}} tree, De Sprookjesboom, designed by Pim-Martijn Sanders and Karel Willemen, in the Fairy Tale Forest based on the character from their animated TV series Sprookjesboom, but the plan was unexpectedly shelved until July 2009, opening only on April 1, 2010. The tree is a wise old oak, which can speak and tell stories, typically about the other inhabitants of the Sprookjesbos. It consists of 1,500 branches and 50,000 sheets. The tree has several effects besides speaking: his <b>whole</b> structure - <b>trunk,</b> branches, leaves - move. It is home to several small animatronics, such as a squirrel, a woodpecker, a spider and talking mushrooms.The old oak is located opposite The Little Match Girl, and is a structure 13 meters wide and 13 meters high.|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} and dose {{measurements were}} performed for radionuclides in the <b>whole</b> body and <b>trunks</b> {{of different sizes}} in order to estimate external radiation whole body doses from patients administered with radiopharmaceuticals. Calculations were performed on cylindrical water phantoms whose height was 176 cm and for three body diameters: of 24 cm, 30 cm, and 36 cm. The investigated radionuclides were: 99 mTc, 131 I, 23 I, 67 Ga, 201 Tl, and 111 In. Measured and MCNP-calculated values were 2 - 6 times lower than the values calculated by the point source method. Additionaly, the total dose received by the public until a radionuclide is completely disintegrated was calculated. The other purpose of this work is to provide data on whole body and finger occupational doses received by technologists working in nuclear medicine. Data showed a wide variation in doses that depended on the individual technologist and {{the position of the}} dosimeter...|$|R
40|$|Carbohydrate-protein supplementation {{has been}} found to {{increase}} the rate of training adaptation when provided postresistance exercise. The present study compared the effects of a carbohydrate and protein supplement in the form of chocolate milk (CM), isocaloric carbohydrate (CHO), and placebo on training adaptations occurring over 4. 5 weeks of aerobic exercise training. Thirty-two untrained subjects cycled 60 [*]min/d, 5 [*]d/wk for 4. 5 [*]wks at 75 – 80 % of maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max). Supplements were ingested immediately and 1 [*]h after each exercise session. VO 2 max and body composition were assessed before the start and end of training. VO 2 max improvements were significantly greater in CM than CHO and placebo. Greater improvements in body composition, represented by a calculated lean and fat mass differential for <b>whole</b> body and <b>trunk,</b> were found in the CM group compared to CHO. We conclude supplementing with CM postexercise improves aerobic power and body composition more effectively than CHO alone...|$|R
