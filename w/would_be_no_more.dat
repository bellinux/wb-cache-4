5|$|On 6 April 2015, an Indonesian court {{rejected}} {{an appeal}} by Chan and Sukumaran, ruling {{that they could}} not challenge the decision by the Indonesian president to grant them clemency in court. One of their lawyers announced that a further appeal would be lodged with the Indonesian Constitutional Court to examine Widodo's refusal to give clemency. However, the Indonesian Attorney-General accused the lawyers of simply trying to buy time, and announced that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> delays to the executions.|$|E
5|$|The PSO {{project cost}} the {{ministry}} at least 25 million. Millions were needed for external consultant fees {{to prepare the}} contracts, {{in addition to the}} cost of upgrading the rolling stock. The exact fees paid were not disclosed to the public. Following the left-winged Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet's victory in the 2005 parliamentary election, the new Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party, announced that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> public tenders in the railway sector. The government stated that experience from Sweden and the United Kingdom showed that employees rights and safety was reduced after privatization was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of The Simpsons {{have won}} dozens of awards, {{including}} 31 Emmy Awards (with ten for Outstanding Animated Program), 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, {{was released in}} theaters worldwide on July 26 and 27, 2007 and grossed US$526.2 million worldwide. The first seventeen seasons are available on DVD in regions 1, 2, and 4, with the twentieth season released on both DVD and Blu-ray in 2010 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the series. On April 8, 2015, showrunner Al Jean announced that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> DVD or Blu-ray releases, shifting focus to digital distribution, although this was later reversed on July 22, 2017.|$|E

5|$|In April 1864, Beauregard {{saw little}} {{opportunity}} for military glory because he foresaw that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> significant assaults against Charleston, and {{prospects for a}} major field command were unlikely. He requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic throat ailment, but he instead received an order to report to Weldon, North Carolina, near the Virginia border, to {{play a key role}} in the defense of Virginia. His new assignment, the Department of North Carolina and Cape Fear, also included Virginia south of the James River. When he took command on April 18, he renamed it, on his own initiative, the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. The Confederates were preparing for the spring offensive of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and were concerned that attacks south of Richmond could interrupt the critical supply lines to Richmond and the army of Robert E. Lee.|$|E
5|$|Upon the Beatles' {{return to}} England, rumours began to {{circulate}} {{that they had}} decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.|$|E

25|$|The Mosquitoes were disbanded in 1956, as {{they were}} {{considered}} a wartime expedient. After their disbandment, the United States once again had no Forward Air Control capabilities. The 1957 STRICOM (U.S. Strike Command) Manual defined the forward air controller as ground bound. There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> airborne FACs until 1962.|$|E
25|$|However, the westward {{expansion}} {{contributed to}} the contraction of the NBA-owned Roanoke Dazzle and Fayetteville Patriots for that season. The Florida Flame suspended operations due to arena scheduling difficulties. After the 2006–07 season, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> teams in the southeastern United States until the 2016 expansion team, the Greensboro Swarm.|$|E
25|$|There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> scoring for {{the rest}} of the game, despite many {{opportunities}} for both teams. Vikings kicker Rick Danmeier missed a 38-yard field goal, while Washington's Mark Moseley also had two misses, from 47 and 39 yards. Moseley, who had become the first kicker to win the NFL MVP award during the year, finished this game having made a total of one of his last five attempts, though his 39-yard miss only occurred after his 29-yard field goal was wiped out by a penalty on teammate Rich Milot.|$|E

25|$|There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> scoring in {{the third}} quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked {{the ball out of}} Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then {{recovered}} it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} such successes, Australian heavy metal {{continues}} {{to remain a}} fringe underground culture still widely ignored by the mainstream industry and media. When it was announced in mid-2006 that the annual Metal for the Brain festival <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> after a final event on 4 November, no regular news service outside of Canberra carried word of it, {{even though it had}} often attracted up to 3000 people and had been running as long as the Big Day Out. In an interview with Australian metal webzine , festival director Adam Agius suggested the festival would return in 2008; this now seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of predation rates also varies between pre- and post-dispersal predation. Although {{both types of}} predation can be extremely high, studies simultaneously evaluating both pre- and post-dispersal seed predation suggest that the latter is often more severe than the former. However, seeds already dispersed and not consumed {{have a chance to}} germinate, and seeds consumed could die regardless of predation due to constraints imposed by unsuitable germination sites. On the other hand, all non-dispersed seeds predated <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than a waste of energy by the parent plant. Therefore, the demographic impacts of pre-dispersal predation on plant populations are likely to be stronger than the impacts of post-dispersal predation.|$|E
50|$|It {{was agreed}} that the {{transitional}} government and national assembly <b>would</b> <b>be</b> established <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than thirty-seven days after {{the signing of the}} Accords.

25|$|The Staggers Act {{allowed the}} setting of rates that would recover capital and {{operating}} cost (fully allocated cost recovery) by each and every route mile the railroad operated. There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> cross-subsidization of costs between route-miles (that is, revenue on profitable route segments {{were not used to}} subsidize routes where rates were set at intermodal parity, yet still did recover fully allocated costs). Finally, where current and/or future traffic projections showed that profitable volumes of traffic would not return, the railroads were allowed to abandon those routes, shippers and passengers to other modes of transportation. Under the Staggers Act, railroads, including Conrail, were freed from the requirement to continue money-losing services.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, this {{disagreement}} {{resulted in}} supply disruptions in many European nations, with eighteen European countries reporting major drops in or complete cut-offs of their gas supplies transported through Ukraine from Russia. In September 2009 officials from both countries stated {{they felt the}} situation was under control and that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> conflicts over the topic, {{at least until the}} Ukrainian 2010 presidential elections. However, in October 2009, another disagreement arose about the amount of gas Ukraine would import from Russia in 2010. Ukraine intended to import less gas in 2010 as a result of reduced industry needs because of its economic recession; however, Gazprom insisted that Ukraine fulfill its contractual obligations and purchase the previously agreed upon quantities of gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposals}} {{included an}} eight-storey flatted factory and 16 workshops with car parking above {{them as well}} as a new Assay Office, School of Jewellery, exhibition hall, restaurant, office block and shop. The flatted factory, known as the Hockley Centre (now the Big Peg), was completed in 1971. The workshops with the car parking space was completed in 1978 to the north of this. The scheme was not a success as there were complaints over the higher rent prices and many of the 150 firms that were displaced by the development moved elsewhere in the Quarter. As a result, the council abandoned the plan to progress further with the development and said there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> large scale redevelopment in the area.|$|E

25|$|However, as Franquin {{grew tired}} of Spirou, his other major {{character}} Gaston began to take precedence in his work, and following the controversial Panade à Champignac, the series passed on to a then unknown young cartoonist, Jean-Claude Fournier, in 1969. One side effect {{of this is that}} the Marsupilami would only appear in one last story, Le faiseur d'or. This is because Franquin decided to retain the rights to that character; all the other characters remained the property of the publisher. Starting with Du glucose pour Noémie, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> appearances of the Marsupilami in Spirou et Fantasio, {{with the exception of a}} few discreet references. Only in the 1980s did the Marsupilami reappear in its own series, and later television cartoon and videogame.|$|E
25|$|Now {{regarded}} as a classic film noir, The Maltese Falcon (1941) was John Huston's directorial debut. Originally a novel written by Dashiell Hammett, it {{was first published in}} the pulp magazine Black Mask in 1929, and had also served as the basis of two other movie versions including Satan Met a Lady (1936) starring Bette Davis. Producer Hal Wallis initially offered the leading man role to George Raft, a more established box office name than Bogart, whose contract stipulated {{he did not have to}} appear in remakes. Fearing it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than a cleaned-up version of the pre-Production Code The Maltese Falcon (1931), Raft turned it down in order to make Manpower with director Raoul Walsh and cast members Edward G. Robinson and Marlene Dietrich. Eagerly, Huston accepted Bogart as his Sam Spade.|$|E
25|$|On 3 June, Israel scored {{its first}} victory in aerial combat when Israeli pilot Modi Alon shot down {{a pair of}} Egyptian DC-3s that had just bombed Tel Aviv. Although Tel Aviv would see {{additional}} raids by fighter aircraft, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> raids by bombers {{for the rest of}} the war. From then on, the Israeli Air Force began engaging the Arab air forces in air-to-air combat. The first dogfight took place on June 8, when an Israeli fighter plane flown by Gideon Lichtman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. By the fall of 1948, the IAF had achieved air superiority and had superior firepower and more knowledgeable personnel, many of whom had seen action in World War II. Israeli planes then began intercepting and engaging Arab aircraft on bombing missions.|$|E
