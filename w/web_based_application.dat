Increasing demand for <b>web</b> <b>based</b> <b>application</b> certainly trigger the needs for a quality assessment of it. In that case, most of the web based quality assessment method utilize usability concept since <b>web</b> <b>based</b> <b>application</b> widely deal with usability characteristics. As a result, there are number of usability assessment methods proposed by researcher which cover mainly on understand ability and learnability. However, the web based usability for educational domain yet to be evaluated from user perspective. For this reason, <b>web</b> <b>based</b> <b>application</b> known as e-appeal system, evaluated empirically in an effort to identify the usefulness of that application. Hence, ISO 9126 usability metrics used as benchmark in this evaluation process by specifying the ability to understood and learned the e-appeal system. As a result, the data shows that e-appeal system is suitable for its intended use to serve the end user. Apart from that, the study outcome indicates that end user can learn on the system functionality within limited time. Thus, it shows the e-appeal system equipped with effective help system and adequate documentation. For the new <b>web</b> <b>based</b> <b>application</b> developer, the e-appeal system evaluation process flow provides a guideline in evaluating application using the mapping strategy.

This high maintenance cost {{is due to the}} heterogeneity of web applications, to fast Internet evolution and the fast-moving market which imposes short development cycles and frequent modifications. In order to control the maintenance cost and to enhance maintainability, quantitative metrics for predicting web applications maintainability must be used.
