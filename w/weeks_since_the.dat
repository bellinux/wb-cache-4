5|$|The {{development}} of Alienation was hinted at in early January 2014 and {{announced at the}} 2014 Sony Gamescom convention. In 2015, the developers released details of the gameplay and classes and its first trailer. According to Sony, the game would be released sometime in 2015; it was delayed until March 2, 2016. After another three-week delay, it was released {{as part of a}} Sony promotion releasing six games in seven <b>weeks.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> release of Alienation, Housemarque has updated the game with free and paid expansions. It received positive reviews, with praise for the twin-stick elements and cooperative multiplayer feature. Reviewers criticized the lack of a local co-op mode, which was later added, and the game's lack of variety in regard to weapons and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} the {{coronation}} has varied throughout British history. King Edgar's coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 957 {{and may have been}} intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, the age at which Jesus Christ was baptised. HaroldII was crowned on the day {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold's succession; whereas the first Norman monarch, WilliamI, was also crowned on the day he became king, 25December 1066, but three <b>weeks</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. EdwardI was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. EdwardII's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. HenryVI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar's coronation was at Pentecost, WilliamI's on Christmas Day, possibly in imitation of the Byzantine emperors, and John's was on Ascension Day. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George's Day, the feast of the patron saint of England.|$|E

25|$|The {{consensus}} concerning monoamniotic twins (identical twins sharing an amniotic sac), {{the highest}} risk type of twins, {{is that they}} should be delivered by caesarean section at or shortly after 32 <b>weeks,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> risks of intrauterine death of one or both twins is higher after this gestation than the risk of complications of prematurity.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{high rates}} of very early {{miscarriage}} (25% of pregnancies are lost within the first six <b>weeks</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> woman's last menstrual period, or LMP), the methods used to detect pregnancy may lead to bias in conception rates. Less-sensitive methods will detect lower conception rates, because they miss the conceptions that resulted in early pregnancy loss. A Chinese study of couples practicing random intercourse to achieve pregnancy used very sensitive pregnancy tests to detect pregnancy. It found a 40% conception rate per cycle over the 12-month study period.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} day as Myers' report was made public, NASCAR {{announced}} its own investigation, after having remained silent for six <b>weeks</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> crash. The official NASCAR report, which had cost over a million dollars and was published on August 21, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt's death {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, which included the last-second collision with Schrader's car, the speed and angle of impact, and the separation of the seat belt as being contributing factors. It was also noted that investigators could not determine whether a head and neck support (HANS) device would have saved Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the forces at work in a crash such as Earnhardt's.|$|E
500|$|A {{statement}} {{purported to}} be released by Kony's Lord's Resistance Army rebels and signed by the group's spokesman and negotiator Justine Nyeko ("The Leader, LRA Peace Team") condemned the film as [...] "a cheap and banal panic act of mass trickery to make the unsuspecting {{peoples of the world}} complicit in the US rogue and murderous activities in Central Africa." [...] The statement was obtained by Ugandan journalist Frank Nyakairu, received from Nairobi, Kenya-based LRA representatives. It was also reported that the LRA abduction rate sharply increased in the <b>weeks</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> film was released, although it was impossible to confirm the link between the rise in LRA attacks and Kony's global notoriety.|$|E

2500|$|The current Rowan-Salisbury School System {{was formed}} in 1989 by the merger of Rowan County Schools and Salisbury City Schools. The process {{leading up to the}} merger was {{difficult}} and almost not approved several times. Declining enrollment in the city and county systems (especially the city system) and a general move towards [...] "white flight" [...] from the more urban and minority-heavy city schools had prompted discussions of merging the systems. At issue in the merger talks primarily was redistricting and racial balance in the schools. However, the separate city and county school boards approved a merger plan on October 16, 1987. This was soon approved by the Rowan County Commission and the State Board of Education. Adding to the stresses of the merger process, a red measles outbreak in 1989 limited school activities and athletics in Rowan and Cabarrus counties for several <b>weeks.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> merger, the system has become the second-largest employer in Rowan County.|$|E
