50|$|In attendance, {{other than}} the Guest of Honour and his wife Anna, were Val Gilbert, former (and for 30 years+) Crossword Editor of the Telegraph, Jeremy Mutch, and Peter Chamberlain, all of whom, like Roger, have clocked up {{more than one hundred}} {{published}} puzzles for the paper; Philip Marlow, who is nearing his own century; John Henderson, official <b>wine-taster,</b> who is nearing double figures on the back page; Dean Mayer, who compiled the Telegraph toughie dedicated to Roger on his birthday; and a surprise guest called John Graham, better known as Araucaria, who composed the birthday sonnet below for 'young master Squires', but had been unable to attend the bunfight at the Guardian two weeks earlier.|$|E
50|$|Cigar smoke, {{which is}} not {{typically}} inhaled, tastes of tobacco with nuances of other tastes. Many different things affect the scent of cigar smoke: tobacco type, quality of the cigar, added flavors, age and humidity, production method (handmade vs. machine-made), and more. A fine cigar can taste completely different from inhaled cigarette smoke. When smoke is inhaled, as is usual with cigarettes, the tobacco flavor is less noticeable than the sensation from the smoke. Some cigar enthusiasts use a vocabulary {{similar to that of}} <b>wine-tasters</b> to describe the overtones and undertones observed while smoking a cigar. Journals are available for recording personal ratings, description of flavors observed, sizes, brands, etc. Cigar smoking is in such respects similar to wine-tasting.|$|R
6000|$|The {{subconscious}} popular instinct against Darwinism {{was not a}} mere {{offense at}} the grotesque notion of visiting one's grandfather in a cage in the Regent's Park. Men go in for drink, practical jokes and many other grotesque things; they do not much mind making beasts of themselves, and would not much mind having beasts made of their forefathers. The real instinct was much deeper and much more valuable. It was this: that when once one begins to think of man as a shifting and alterable thing, it is always easy for the strong and crafty to twist him into new shapes {{for all kinds of}} unnatural purposes. The popular instinct sees in such developments the possibility of backs bowed and hunch-backed for their burden, or limbs twisted for their task. It has a very well-grounded guess that whatever is done swiftly and systematically will mostly be done by a successful class and almost solely in their interests. It has therefore a vision of inhuman hybrids and half-human experiments much in the style of Mr. Wells's [...] "Island of Dr. Moreau." [...] The rich man may come to breeding a tribe of dwarfs to be his jockeys, and a tribe of giants to be his hall-porters. Grooms might be born bow-legged and tailors born cross-legged; perfumers might have long, large noses and a crouching attitude, like hounds of scent; and professional <b>wine-tasters</b> might have the horrible expression of one tasting wine stamped upon their faces as infants. Whatever wild image one employs it cannot keep pace with the panic of the human fancy, when once it supposes that the fixed type called man could be changed. If some millionaire wanted arms, some porter must grow ten arms like an octopus; if he wants legs, some messenger-boy must go with a hundred trotting legs like a centipede. In the distorted mirror of hypothesis, that is, of the unknown, men can dimly see such monstrous and evil shapes; men run all to eye, or all to fingers, with nothing left but one nostril or one ear. That is the nightmare with which the mere notion of adaptation threatens us. That is the nightmare that is not so very far from the reality.|$|R
