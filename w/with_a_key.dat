For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users.

In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted {{all the way through}} the network from the one user to the other.|$|E

John Wilson and his successor, William Dana Orcutt, continued to print the book until after Eddy's death. To the 6th edition in 1883, Eddy added <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Key</b> to the Scriptures (later retitled with Key to the Scriptures), a 20-page glossary containing her definitions of biblical terms. The book sold 15,000 copies between 1875 and 1885.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in 2008 when Dontnod Entertainment was formed. Initially called Adrift, the {{original}} concept {{of the game}} was a world flooded from global warming, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> gameplay mechanic being the player character using jetskis to navigate a coastal city. Later, the team {{became interested in the}} concept of memory as a central theme and redesigned the game accordingly, although game director Jean-Maxime Moris was reluctant to set the game in Paris since the studio was based there. It was originally developed as a role-playing game with Sony publishing it exclusively for the PlayStation 3, starting full development in February 2010. Following creative disagreements between Dontnod and Sony, and the subsequent cancellation of the project in February 2011 because of budget cuts, the project was presented at the 2011 Gamescom trade fair in the hope that it would garner the attention necessary to secure another publishing deal. Capcom purchased the intellectual property in 2012 and provided funding for the project, reimagining it as an action-adventure game for release on multiple platforms.|$|E

As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main {{schools of thought}} have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the World Zionist Organization, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E
