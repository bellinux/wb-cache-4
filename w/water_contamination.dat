5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} killed 159 men, {{and destroyed}} {{both of the}} rear turrets. The fire was prevented from spreading to the shell magazines, which could have destroyed the ship, by the quick action of the executive officer, who ordered both magazines be flooded. The Pumpenmeister Wilhelm Heidkamp was severely injured when he turned the red-hot valves to flood the magazines. At 11:01, Seydlitz struck back at Lion, and with a single 28cm shell, knocked out two of Lions engines. Shortly thereafter, a pair of 30.5cm shells fired by Derfflinger struck Lion, one at the waterline. The penetration allowed water to enter the port feed tankâ€”this hit eventually crippled Lion, the sea <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> forced the ship's crew {{to shut down the}} port engine. At 11:25, Seydlitz was struck on her armored belt amidships by a third and final shell, which did little damage.|$|E

25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>contamination</b> {{is also a}} {{potential}} problem when using certain chemical catalysts involved in the production process, substantially reducing catalytic efficiency of base (high pH) catalysts such as potassium hydroxide. However, the super-critical methanol production methodology, whereby the transesterification process of oil feedstock and methanol is effectuated under high temperature and pressure, {{has been shown to}} be largely unaffected by the presence of <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> during the production phase.|$|E

25|$|Contamination of {{drinking}} water supplies can not only occur in the source water {{but also in the}} distribution system. Sources of <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> include naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. Some examples of health implications of <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> are gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.|$|E

5000|$|The Nokia <b>water</b> supply <b>contamination</b> {{occurred}} from November 28 to 29, 2007, when a {{large part}} of the water supply in Nokia, Finland, was contaminated with treated sewage <b>water.</b> The <b>contamination</b> affected an area with some 12,000 inhabitants and caused an epidemic of thousands of cases of diarrhea and vomiting primarily due to Norovirus and Campylobacter infections. Hundreds of inhabitants were hospitalised, and the town was forced to temporarily forbid all use of tap water.|$|R

25|$|The {{environmental}} justice {{aspect of this}} is that hydraulic fracturing sites {{are more likely to be}} located in places with a higher percentage of minority and low-income people.

25|$|The {{explosion}} {{in the number of}} high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> and a decline in air quality. Other factors negatively affecting Iowa's environment include the extensive use of older coal-fired power plants, fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production, and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer.|$|E
40|$|Water {{supply systems}} are {{vulnerable}} to damage caused by unintended or intended human actions, or due to aging of the system. In order to minimize the damages and the inconvenience for the customers, a software tool was developed to detect anomalies at an early stage, and to support the responsible staff in taking the right decisions to restore the normal situation. The software is designed for water quantity events {{as well as for}} water quality events. The model aims to detect events which occur relatively frequently in water distribution systems, like pipe bursts events and water discolouration events.

50|$|Greek and Roman {{physicians}} {{knew the}} association between stagnant or tainted waters and water-borne disease. They also knew the adverse health effects of lead on those who mined and processed it, and for this reason, ceramic pipes were preferred over lead. Where lead pipes were used, a continuous water-flow and the inevitable deposition of water-borne minerals within the pipes somewhat reduced the <b>water's</b> <b>contamination</b> by soluble lead. Nevertheless, the level of lead in this water was 100 times higher than in local spring waters.|$|R
25|$|The port's {{proximity}} {{has contributed}} to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and <b>water</b> <b>contamination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pollution {{can also}} be the {{consequence}} of a natural disaster. For example, hurricanes often involve <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> from sewage, and petrochemical spills from ruptured boats or automobiles. Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal oil rigs or refineries are involved. Some sources of pollution, such as nuclear power plants or oil tankers, can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.|$|E
25|$|Butanol better tolerates <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> and is less {{corrosive}} than ethanol {{and more}} suitable for distribution through existing pipelines for gasoline. In blends with diesel or gasoline, butanol {{is less likely to}} separate from this fuel than ethanol if the fuel is contaminated with water. There is also a vapor pressure co-blend synergy with butanol and gasoline containing ethanol, which facilitates ethanol blending. This facilitates storage and distribution of blended fuels.|$|E

25|$|From mid-2005, Bandung faced another {{environmental}} disaster, {{when the}} city's land fill site was reevaluated after a garbage slide in 2005 which buried a village, Kampung Gajah, beneath it, killing {{over a hundred}} people. The accumulation of 8,000 m3/day of domestic garbage piled up, causes severe air pollution by local burning, the spread of disease, and <b>water</b> <b>contamination.</b> The provincial government has so far failed in its attempts to solve the garbage issue.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{conventional}} unleaded gasoline, ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and aldehydes. The Clean Air Act requires {{the addition of}} oxygenates to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the United States. The additive MTBE is currently being phased out due to ground <b>water</b> <b>contamination,</b> hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive. Current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient fertilizers such as ammonia.|$|E

25|$|Water in fuel {{can damage}} a fuel {{injection}} pump; some diesel fuel filters also trap water. <b>Water</b> <b>contamination</b> in diesel fuel {{can lead to}} freezing while in the fuel tank. The freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump. Once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze, gelling {{is more likely to}} occur.

25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of main engine power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the casualty, sea <b>water</b> <b>contamination</b> was found in settling tanks, day tanks, main engine primary filters and main engine injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil tanks through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq.|$|E

While the toad is usually limited to areas with a constant supply of water, populations have begun to spread into drier places.
