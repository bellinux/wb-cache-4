25|$|Knudsen's {{success at}} Pontiac {{led to his}} {{promotion}} to general manager of Chevrolet Division in 1961. While at Pontiac he was noted for his interest in performance, and this continued {{with the introduction of}} the Chevrolet Super Sport models. He also insisted on changes to improve the safety of the Chevrolet Corvair, which was not reported publicly until it was revealed by John DeLorean in his book On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors. Knudsen also reportedly rejected an idea to offer a Pontiac version of the revolutionary Corvair in favor a front-engine compact car to be offered by Oldsmobile (as the F-85) and Buick (as the Special) for 1961. Pontiac introduced its version of the Buick-Olds-Pontiac compact as the Tempest for 1961, but gave that car some unique engineering features such as a slanted four-cylinder engine (<b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> half of a Pontiac 389 V8), rear swing axles and a rear transaxle (both derived from the Corvair) driven by a flexing shaft to eliminate the driveshaft hump for increased interior space.|$|E

25|$|By 1961, British {{specialist}} teams such as Lotus, Cooper and BRM, {{and later}} McLaren, Tyrrell and Williams- organizations created purely for producing, developing and competing purpose-built open-wheel racing cars had overtaken the industrial manufacturing powers such as Ferrari, Mercedes, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. The only major automotive manufacturer {{with a full}} works effort was Ferrari- <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a manufacturer that made road cars to fund its racing in F1 and endurance racing. Whereas the big continental manufacturers, with lots of money to spend built the whole car including the drivetrain systems themselves, (excluding BRM), the British teams, with only limited amounts of money only built their chassis; they bought their engines and gearboxes from independent manufacturers such as Coventry-Climax and later Ford/Cosworth engines, and Hewland gearboxes. The only British team that was also a manufacturer of road cars like Ferrari was Lotus; but even so that company grew considerably but never {{to the size of}} Mercedes or Alfa Romeo. From 1957 to 1961, Formula One had transformed from a scattershot industrial manufacturer sideshow of technology to a seriously competitive business for team owners and engineers wanting to come up with new technologies to out-do the opposition and also to sell their technology to big manufacturers or other interested parties. People like Cooper and Lotus founders John Cooper and Colin Chapman proved that competitiveness and developing new automotive technology was about fresh thinking, not industrial might. These British teams were regularly beating manufacturer teams like Ferrari, whom company founder Enzo Ferrari referring to these new British teams as garagistes- Italian for garage teams- which is effectively how all these British teams operated- their cars were built in small sheds or garages.|$|E

After Hurricane Katrina hit several U.S. states in 2005, Grand Forks adopted the city of Biloxi, Mississippi. Current Grand Forks mayor Michael Brown stated that it was important [...] "to utilize the experience from those people who went through those disasters, like our fire chief, police chief and public works directors. So we went to Biloxi and said, 'This is what we have learned.'" [...] Grand Forks leaders met with Biloxi city officials, and sent a list of contacts and a 24-page booklet that detailed how to coordinate volunteer agencies and how to interact with FEMA. One Biloxi city official stated that Grand Forks had [...] "just helped us to understand what we were looking at, and gave us some direction to go in, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> needed, with the rebuilding and the recovering." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> rebel music. I felt that would really {{be the way to}} break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.|$|E
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E

Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When {{they say that they}} left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that he dreamed of a simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into piracy to support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They then tell Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aforementioned}} Buick 215 V8, {{was ordered}} {{by less than}} two percent of its customers {{in the two years}} it was available, 1961 and 1962. Today, the 215 cars are among the most sought-after of all Tempests. In 1963, Pontiac replaced the 215 with a [...] "new" [...] 326 <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a 336 with a bore of 3.78 and stroke of 3.75 ( [...] same stroke as the 389 [...] ), an iron block mill that had the same external dimensions and shared parts with the 389, but an altered, reduced bore. The car's body and suspension was also changed to be lower, longer and wider. The response was {{that more than half of}} the 1963 Tempests and LeMans (separate lines for that one year only) were ordered with the V8, a trend that did not go unnoticed by management. The next year, the 326 would become a true 326 with a new bore size of 3.72. The Tempest's popularity helped move Pontiac into third place among American car brands in 1962, a position Pontiac would hold through 1970. The Buick 215 V8 would remain in production for more than thirty five years, being used by Britain's Rover Group after it had bought the rights to it. GM attempted to buy the rights back, however, Rover wished, instead, to sell the engines directly.|$|E
