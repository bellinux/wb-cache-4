5|$|In 2014, Iran {{started the}} second phase of its {{targeted}} subsidy plan under President Hassan Rohani. Petrol prices were raised by 75% from 4,000 to 7,000 rials ($0.16 to $0.28) per litre, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> from the target price of approx. $0.90 per litre. As a consequence, fuel smuggling and gasoline imports increased again.|$|E
5|$|The {{discoveries of}} the high-radii planets HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b, {{along with that}} of WASP-17b, contributed to the {{question}} of what factors, besides temperature, contribute to the large radii of these inflated planets. The discrepancy lies in planet WASP-18b, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> hotter than the newly discovered HAT planets and WASP-17b, but has a far smaller radius.|$|E
5|$|If Malcolm {{exercised}} {{control over}} Moray, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> from being generally accepted, then the annals record {{a number of}} events pointing to a struggle for power in the north. In 1020, Mac Bethad's father Findláech mac Ruaidrí was killed by the sons of his brother Máel Brigte. It seems that Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti took control of Moray, for his death is reported in 1029.|$|E

5|$|Thallium {{tends to}} oxidize to the +3 and +1 {{oxidation}} states as ionic salts. The +3 state {{resembles that of}} the other elements in group 13 (boron, aluminium, gallium, indium). However, the +1 state, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> more prominent in thallium than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of alkali metals, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K+) by ion pumps in living cells.|$|E
5|$|There are 41 macroinvertebrate taxa {{that have}} been {{observed}} in West Creek, more than have been observed in all of upper Fishing Creek. The number of macroinvertebrates per square meter in West Creek at the site WC1 (in the lower reaches of the creek) is nearly 900, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> higher {{than the number of}} macroinvertebrates per square meter in any other site except the site WC2, in the middle reaches of the creek. Site WC2 has a macroinvertebrate density of 600 macroinvertebrates per square meter. Approximately 60% of the taxa are Ephemeroptera (mayflies), 10% each are Plecoptera (stoneflies), and approximately 5% are Trichoptera (caddisflies).|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} include Russborough, designed by Richard Cassels, an architect of German origin, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, and Florence Court, County Fermanagh. Irish Palladian Country houses often feature robust Rococo plasterwork, frequently {{executed by the}} Lafranchini brothers, an Irish speciality, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin {{was built in the}} 18th century that it set a Georgian stamp on the city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin {{was one of the few}} cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} non-commutative analogs {{of transport}} maps among free Gibbs state satisfying a certain convexity condition.

Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{carriers}} {{based on}} nanostructured carbon (such as carbon buckyballs and nanotubes) have been proposed. However, since Hydrogen usually amounts up to ~3.0-7.0 wt% at 77K <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> from the value set by US department of Energy (6 wt% at nearly ambient conditions), it makes carbon materials poor candidates for hydrogen storage.|$|E

However, strikeout data for hitters only dates back to 1913, so in the years with complete statistics his walk/strikeout ratio was 69/43 = 1.6, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> above the Major League average of that period (approximately 0.8).|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{distinction}} between Buddhism brought to the West by Asian immigrants, which may be Mahayana, Theravada or a traditional East Asian mix, and Buddhism as practiced by converts, which is often Zen, Pure Land, Vipassana or Tibetan Buddhism.

25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is generally}} avoided {{as far as}} is reasonably practicable by positioning of the air intake in uncontaminated air, filtration of particulates from the intake air, use of suitable compressor design and appropriate lubricants, and ensuring that running temperatures are not excessive. Where the residual risk is excessive, a hopcalite catalyst {{can be used in}} the high pressure filter to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> less toxic.|$|E

High school costs approximately CFA25,000 ($50 USD) per year, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.|$|E
25|$|North Carolina was {{the site}} of few battles, but it {{provided}} the Confederacy with at least 125,000 troops, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> more than any other state did. Approximately 40,000 of those troops died: more than half of disease, the remainder from battlefield wounds and from starvation. North Carolina also supplied about 15,000 Union troops. Elected in 1862, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance tried to maintain state autonomy against Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond.|$|E
25|$|As Washington neighborhoods undergo gentrification, {{crime has}} been {{displaced}} further east.
