40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Horticulture in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012 The effects of various <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> were assessed on Cucumber (Cucumis sativa L.) grown hydroponically in the greenhouse. The objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate influence of <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> on: i) photosynthesis and chlorophyll content of Cucumis sativa L.; ii) the nutrient uptake in Cucumis sativa L. iii) flavonoid and anthocyanin metabolism in Cucumis sativa L. and iv) growth and yield in Cucumis sativa L. The treatments included 8 various water regimes (2 l/h, 4 l/h, 6 l/h, 8 l/h, 10 l/h, 12 l/h, 14 l/h and 16 l/h. The plants received water five times a day, making it 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 litres per day. Results showed that generally the Photosynthetic rate (A), intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci) and stomata conductance (gs) and the transpiration rate of the cucumber plants were significantly increased by increasing <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> compared with lower <b>water</b> <b>quantities.</b> Additionally, there were significant improvements in leaf colour in weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Overall, the foliage colour was improved as water supply was increased. The greener leaves were documented in treatments supplied with higher water doses. Additionally, the chlorophyll content of cucumber plants was increased significantly with varying <b>water</b> <b>quantities.</b> The highest chlorophyll contents were found in plants treated with 16 l/h. The fresh and dry weights of roots, leaves and stems were significantly (P≤ 0. 001) influenced by different <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> supplied to Cucumis sativa L. The largest quantity of fresh roots was recorded in the control treatment (2 l/h) in comparison with all other treatments. However, the best growth with regard to fresh and dry weights of leaves and stems were recorded by supplying the <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> ranging from 10 - 16 l/h. Altering water supply significantly (P≤ 0. 001) affected the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, sodium, copper, zinc, aluminium and iron in roots of Cucumis sativa L. Irregular results were recorded in the uptake of these nutrients in the roots. However, leaf uptake of N, P, K, Ca, magnesium, sulphur, Cu, Zn, manganese, boron, and Al responded significantly (P≤ 0. 001) to the different <b>water</b> <b>quantities.</b> The best result for each was observed at quantities involving 16 l/h. In stems of cucumber <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> significantly (P≤ 0. 001) affected the uptake of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, S, Cu, Zn, Mn and B. The highest uptake of N, P, Ca, Mg and S were found at the maximum supply of water (16 l/h) compared with the control (2 l/h). Sodium uptake showed irregular patterns, whereas K and Zinc uptake peaked at 14 l/h. The data from this study showed that flavonoid metabolism was not significantly affected by the different <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> supplied to cucumber plants. However, the anthocyanin content in roots, leaves, and stem was significantly influenced by water levels. The lowest <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> (2 - 6 l/h) significantly increased the levels of anthocyanins in all tissues tested. Increasing <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> significantly decreased the anthocynanin metabolism in all tissues. Plant height displayed significant differences with <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> from weeks 1 - 8. In week 1, the plant height was superior at supplying 4 l/h in comparison with other treatments. In week 2 and 5 irregular trends were detected. At weeks 3 and 4, plants supplied with 8 - 12 l/h displayed superior plant height performance. At weeks 7 - 8, significant and optimal results were observed at <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> ranging from 4 - 16 l/h compared with the control treatment. <b>Water</b> <b>quantities</b> significantly (P≤ 0. 001) affected the number of leaves per plant from weeks 2 - 8. Irregular results were displayed in weeks 2 and 3. At weeks 4 and 5, the highest numbers of leaves were in <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> of 12 l/h and 10 l/h, respectively. Generally, leaf numbers increased with increasing water levels from weeks 6 - 8. Plant vigour was significantly affected by the alteration of <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> at weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. At weeks 1 and 4, more vigorous plants were found in the treatments that received from 10 - 16 l/h. At weeks 2 and 5, optimal results were found at treatments that received from 6 - 14 l/h. At weeks 6, 7 and 8, the most vigorous plants were found at the highest <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> of 16 l/h. With fruit length, fruit width, rind colour, fruit quality (marketable fruit) and weight, results from the harvest done in the first, second and third week showed that <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> significantly influenced these parameters. Optimal results were reported when the plants were supplied with water ranging between 14 - 16 l/h. During harvesting at week 4, the fruit length, width, rind colour, were of marketable quality at 16 l/h. Generally, the plants that received highest amount of water (16 l/h) had the highest cucumber yields compared with all other treatments. Higher <b>water</b> <b>quantities</b> in this study resulted in increased physiological responses such as photosynthesis and nutrient uptake which resulted in the higher fruit yields. In water-limited environments, results from this study could assist growers with reasonable cucumber yields while saving water for other farm uses...|$|R

This integrated model provides the foundation for research of <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality optimization on dam operation in Wenyu River Catchment. The results of this modeling also suggest that current water quality of Wenyu River will improve following the implementation of the optimized operation of the main dams and floodgates. By pollution control and <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality joint operation of dams and floodgates, water quality of Wenyu river will change significantly, and the available water resources will increase by 134 %, 32 %, 17 %, and 82 % at the downstream sites of Sha River Reservoir, Lutong Floodgate, Xinpu Floodgate, and Weigou Floodgate, respectively.

The literature on water resource systems analysis was reviewed to arrive at an understanding of how <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality problems were analyzed and incorporated, how uncertainty was accounted for, and what cases have been studied in <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality management. The literature revealed that (1) previous studies of <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality management were related to river or lake basins, and none was about a canal basin with strict water quality requirements; (2) none of the studies in China combined both quantity and quality problems in an optimization framework; and (3) no previous study attempted to communicate uncertain messages directly into optimization processes and solutions. This study has developed a grey linear programming (GLP) model for <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> allocation and quality planning, and advanced a new solving approach which can effectively incorporate uncertain messages into the optimization framework. This method has been applied to <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality management in a water delivery canal in Xiamen, China. Results of the case study indicate that the derived decision schemes are feasible for the study area. When the canal water quality has precedence, the scheme for lower limit of objective function has to be adopted. Under this alternative, less cropping area, manure application and livestock numbers, and no fertilizer application are programmed. When agricultural income has precedence, the scheme for upper limit of objective function can be adopted. Under this alternative, more cropping areas, manure application and livestock numbers, and some fertilizer application are programmed. Therefore, decision makers can adjust the grey decision variables (including cropping area, manure and ferti 1 izer applications and livestock numbers) within their grey intervals according to the detailed situations. Reliability of the method has been proved through sensitivity tests of the impacts of pollutant loss constraints on agricultural income, the costs of reducing pollutant losses, the impacts of <b>water</b> <b>quantity</b> constraints on agricultural income, and the effects of grey inputs on grey outputs...|$|R
