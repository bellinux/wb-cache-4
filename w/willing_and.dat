5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings {{are based on the}} openness of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E

5|$|In {{search of}} someone <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> {{able to go}} to Budapest to {{organize}} a rescue program for the nation's Jews, Olsen established contact with a relief committee composed of many prominent Swedish Jews led by the Swedish Chief Rabbi Marcus Ehrenpreis to locate an appropriate person to travel to Budapest under diplomatic cover and lead the rescue operation. One member of the committee was Wallenberg's business associate Kalman Lauer.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus' persuasion alone that caused Edwin to convert. The Northumbrian nobles {{seem to have been}} <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> the king also received letters from Pope Boniface V urging his conversion. Eventually convinced, Edwin and many of his followers were baptised at York in 627. One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering, Paulinus spent 36days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin's royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Consuls {{were each}} {{assigned}} {{two of the}} four legions to command, rarely employing all four legions at once to the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command {{on the day of the}} battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders. However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> able to protect his reputation— most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius (one of our main sources of this history).|$|E

5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, <b>willing,</b> <b>and</b> able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1793, war and {{internal}} disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following {{the collapse of the}} harvest. France's ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> able to sell grain to the National Convention was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British Royal Navy—at war with France since early 1793—patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|News of the war's end {{was brought}} by Pereira Pinto {{and met with}} joy in Rio de Janeiro. Brazilian Emperor Dom PedroII found himself waylaid by a crowd of {{thousands}} in the streets amid acclamations. But public opinion quickly changed for the worse, when newspapers began running stories painting the accord of 20 February as harmful to Brazilian interests, for which the cabinet was blamed. The newly raised Viscount of Tamandaré and Mena Barreto (now Baron of São Gabriel) had supported the peace accord. Tamandaré changed his mind soon afterward and played along with the allegations. Paranhos (a member of the opposition party) {{was used as a}} scapegoat by the Emperor and the government, and was recalled in disgrace to the imperial capital. Subsequent events show the accusation was unfounded. Not only had Paranhos managed to settle all Brazilian claims, but by avoiding the death of thousands, he gained a <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> grateful Uruguayan ally, not a dubious and resentful one — who provided Brazil an important base of operations during the war with Paraguay that followed.|$|E

5|$|Truman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the Warsaw Pact.|$|E

25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where {{there is a limit to}} the output of firms which they are <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
