2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Market Garden, Montgomery made holding the Arnhem salient his first priority, arguing that the 2nd British Army might {{still be able to}} break through and reach the wide open plains of northern Germany, and that {{he might be able to}} take the Ruhr by the end of October. In the meantime, the 1st Canadian Army, which been given the task of clearing the mouth of the river Scheldt, despite the fact that in the words of Copp and Vogel [...] "...that Montgomery's Directive required the Canadians to continue to fight alone for almost two weeks in a battle which everyone agreed could only be won with the aid of additional divisions". For his part, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the German commander of the Western Front ordered General Gustav-Adolf von Zangen, the commander of 15th Army that: [...] "The attempt of the enemy to occupy the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> in order to obtain the free use of the harbor of Antwerp must be resisted to the utmost" [...] (emphasis in the original). Rundstedt argued with Hitler that as long as the Allies could not use the port of Antwerp, the Allies would lack the logistical capacity for an invasion of Germany.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1809, Daring {{served in}} the Walcheren Campaign, in the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt,</b> being {{detached}} under Sir Home Popham to take soundings. Daring was at the siege of Flushing, and was instrumental in saving the brigs [...] and [...] after they had grounded within point-blank shot of the enemy.|$|E
50|$|An amphibious {{attack was}} made across the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> by the British 52nd (Lowland) Division {{to get in}} behind the German′s Beveland Canal {{defensive}} positions. Thus this formidable defence was outflanked, and the Canadian 6th Infantry Brigade began a frontal attack in assault boats. The engineers were able to bridge the canal on the main road.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the area}} <b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt</b> (Royal Flanders), {{as well as}} other provinces of the Burgundian state, were claimed as reverted fiefs by France. Fearing French invasion, the provinces of the Low Countries levied an army of 100,000 men to replace the former ducal army; more than one-third of its troops were {{supplied}} by Flanders.Mary, seeking peace with her powerful neighbor, was involved in negotiations with Louis XI concerning a possible marriage to the Dauphin Charles (then only eight years old), but her embassy met harsh demands for territorial concessions to the French crown.|$|R
5000|$|He {{defeated}} {{the army of}} Flanders that had invaded Walcheren in 1253, where he captured Guy and John of Dampierre, both sons of Margaret II, Countess of Flanders and commanders for Flanders. In 1256 he signed a peace treaty (called the [...] "Treaty of Péronne") with Flanders {{on the status of}} Zeeland, reaffirming Flanders' rights <b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt</b> river. Flanders was forced to compensate Holland for the damages of the war and only after this Margaretha's sons were freed. Floris was killed at a tournament in Antwerp, and was buried in Middelburg.|$|R
5000|$|Up to 1477, {{the area}} under French {{suzerainty}} was located <b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt</b> River and was called [...] "Royal Flanders" [...] (Dutch: Kroon-Vlaanderen, French: Flandre royale). Aside from this the Counts of Flanders from the 11th century on also held land {{east of the}} river as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, an area called [...] "Imperial Flanders" [...] (Rijks-Vlaanderen or Flandre impériale). Part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1384, the county was finally removed from French to Imperial control after the Peace of Madrid in 1526 and the Peace of Ladies in 1529.|$|R
50|$|The final phase, Operation Infatuate was {{the attack}} on the heavily {{fortified}} island of Walcheren {{at the mouth of the}} <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> The island's dykes were breached by attacks from RAF Bomber Command on 3, 7, and 11 October. This flooded the central part of the island, forcing the German defenders onto the high ground and allowing the use of amphibious vehicles. Units of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacked the causeway on 31 October, and after a grim struggle, established a precarious foothold. They were relieved by a battalion of the British 52nd Division. In conjunction with the waterborne attacks, the 52nd continued the advance.|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of the Scheldt, 8 Recce {{advanced}} westwards {{and cleared}} the southern {{bank of the}} <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> river. In one notable action, armoured cars of 'A' Squadron were ferried across the river; {{on the other side}} the cars then proceeded to liberate the island of North Beveland by November 2, 1944. Bluff {{played an important role in}} this operation. The German defenders had been warned that they would be attacked by ground support aircraft on their second low-level pass if they did not surrender immediately. Shortly thereafter 450 Germans surrendered after their positions were buzzed by 18 Typhoons. Unbeknownst to the Germans, the Typhoons would not have been able to fire on their positions since the aircraft's munitions were already committed to another operation.|$|E
50|$|As {{the fourth}} {{phase of the}} battle opened, only the island of Walcheren {{at the mouth of}} the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> {{remained}} in German hands. The island's defences were extremely strong: heavy coastal batteries on the western and southern coasts defended both the island and the Scheldt estuary, and the coastline had been strongly fortified against amphibious assaults. Furthermore, a landward-facing defensive perimeter had been built around the town of Vlissingen (in English, Flushing) to further defend its port facilities should an Allied landing on Walcheren succeed. The only land approach was the Sloedam—a long, narrow causeway from South Beveland, little more than a raised two-lane road. To make matters more difficult, the flats that surrounded this causeway were too saturated with sea water for movement on foot, but had too little water for an assault in storm boats.|$|E
50|$|Souham {{devised a}} {{strategic}} pincer movement consisting of his division attacking southwards from Kortrijk (Courtrai) and Maj-Gen Bonnaud's division northeastwards from Lille, thus catching the separated allied columns of Georg Wilhelm von dem Bussche, Rudolf Ritter von Otto and the Duke of York between them. Meanwhile, part of Moreau's command held off the assault of the Count of Clerfayt from the north. It was a sprawling engagement fought out over many {{square miles of}} countryside just <b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt</b> River in Flanders. Together with Maj-Gen Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's victory at the Battle of Fleurus on 16 June, Tourcoing marked {{the start of the}} evacuation of the allied forces from Flanders and French supremacy in Western Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Emperor Lothair {{finally had}} to yield the {{superior}} strength of Louis the German and Charles the Bald, who confirmed their pact by the Oaths of Strasbourg. He concluded his fighting and in August 843 signed the Treaty of Verdun with his younger brothers. As {{a result of this}} treaty, the empire of late Louis the Pious ("Francia") was officially divided between his three surviving sons: Louis the German received the lands east of the Rhine and Aare rivers ("East Francia"), Charles the Bald the territories <b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt,</b> Meuse, Saône, and Rhône ("West Francia"), while Lothair retained the interjacent lands from Frisia to Italy, including the cities of Aachen and Rome ("Middle Francia" [...] or Lotharii Regnum), and the title of Holy Roman Emperor.|$|R
50|$|Initially the French kings {{meant to}} secure {{the safety of the}} {{northern}} French border from Viking invasions with this act. The counts, however, made good use of the crisis situation by incorporating the surrounding plundered territories into the county. The counts expanded the influence of the original Flemish pagus over the years over all territories south and <b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt</b> river, including presentday the lordship of the Four Amts, Zeelandic Flanders, the burgraviate of Aalst to the east and the County of Artois to the south, which remained part of Flanders until it became a separate county in 1237. After that date, the county of Artois at various times still came under the dominion of the count of Flanders as a separate title, until it was absorbed by the French crown.|$|R
50|$|Antwerp {{had been}} {{captured}} on 4 September but, despite strenuous efforts by Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay (Allied Naval Commander Expeditionary Force) to concentrate Field Marshall Montgomery's mind on the opening of Antwerp as a top priority, Montgomery had failed to realize its strategic importance until after the Germans had, on 17 September, succeeded in heavily mining the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> Following the failure of Operation Market Garden, the full strategic significance of Antwerp dawned upon the Allies, {{with the realization that}} a huge mine clearance operation was needed in the Scheldt estuary in order to open it up. This could only be undertaken when the enemy had been driven from both banks of the Scheldt estuary. The northern bank, consisting of the large island of Walcheren and its causeway to the mainland, remained heavily fortified and strongly garrisoned by the Germans, with batteries sweeping the Scheldt and preventing the essential mine clearance from proceeding.|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} {{geography of the}} <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> region, in particular the southeastern part of it bas been studied both by historians and geographers, {{but there is no}} consensus between them about the genesis of the landscape which bas been influenced by the presence of the river Scheldt. In this article we try to bring together the different points of view as well as their argumentation, to which new interpretation is added in order to come to an integration of the sources and -in our opinion -to provide an acceptable explanation of the {{historical geography}} of that region. There can be made a crude distinction between three regions in the area under consideration, which run more or less parallel to the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> river. First there is the most southerly area {{on both sides of the}} frontier between Belgium and the Netherlands. There is historical evidence that this region was largely covered with peat during the Middle Ages (fig. 1). De moeren, as this area was called in Dutch, were systematically drained from the 12 th century on- wards and parceled out by important entrepreneurs from the cities as well as by religious institutions (such as the abbey of St. Baafs in Ghent), to dig out the valuable fuel and to make arable land after- wards. In this part of the region all the peat has been excavated. This was easy to do because of the thinness of the peat layer caused by a higher positition of the underlying pleistocene deposits. To this day this pleistocene sandy soil preserves its typicallinear settlement with an organisation of the land in small strips (Marsch- hufenfluren) (see figs. 2 and 3). Some Belgian geographers in- correctly considered this field pattern as typical of the Flemish sandy soils"(!), denying or neglecting the nearness of the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> in the formation of the landscape. The second region we studied is the area at present covered with a layer of clay. Contrary to what has sometimes been pointed out, this clay is of rather recent genesis. The Dunkerque transgressions had little influence on these deposits, but the artificial inundations of the later sixteenth century are for the greater part responsible for this important sedimentation. Historical sources prove a very intensive activity of peat digging here during the later Middle Ages. Some misunderstandings of this matter, resulting from palynological research, are probably caused by the fact that the top of the peat layer is mostly missing by peat exploitation or by erosion. Nevertheless, we could calculate that in the parishes Kieldrecht, Verrebroek and Kallo a minimum of 100, 000 m J of peat was digged out in the year 1400. If the activity went on with the same intensity every year, about I meter would have been excavated in one century in an area with a surface of about 250 acres. Some geographers, believing in early clay sedimentation, consider peat digging in this region most unlikely. Finally, the last region under consideration is the rather narrow territory near the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt.</b> Of course the history of the deposits within this region is closely tied to the history of the origin of the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> itself. Written sources are insufficient to resolve the problem. Pollenanalytical observations on useful samples, in combination with radiocarbon datings led to the conclusion that this branch of the Scheldt has a post-Roman genesis, at the earliest dating from the Dunkerque II transgression (fig. 5 Waarde and Oorderen). In the beginning the tides will have had little influence, as can be shown by the peat which continued to grow in the neighbourhood of the banks of the West and the Lower Scheldt probably until the year 1000. Evidence for this conclusion is provided in the pollenanalyses of Saaftinge and Zandvliet where, after the second Subatlantic fagus maximum -in Zandvliet C 14 dated 940 A. D. - the peat kept growing for a certain time (see fig. 5) ...|$|E
50|$|Tournai, {{known as}} Tornacum, {{was a place}} of minor {{importance}} in Roman times, a stopping place where the Roman road from Cologne on the Rhine to Boulogne on the coast crossed the river Scheldt. It was fortified under Maximian in the 3rd century AD, when the Roman limes was withdrawn to the string of outposts along the road. It came into the possession of the Salian Franks in 432. Under king Childeric I, whose tomb was discovered there in 1653, Tournai was the capital of the Frankish empire. In 486, Clovis moved the center of power to Paris. In turn, a native son of Tournai, Eleutherius, became bishop of the newly created bishopric of Tournai, extending over most of the area <b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt.</b> In 862 Charles the Bald, first king of Western Francia and still to become Holy Roman Emperor, would make Tournai the seat of the County of Flanders.|$|R
5000|$|After the Western Roman Empire {{had already}} {{collapsed}} in Galla Belgica {{for some time}} the Gallo-Roman [...] "Kingdom of Soissons" [...] (457-486) managed to maintain control over the area around Soissons. The Franks however emerged victorious and Belgica Secunda in the 5th century {{became the center of}} Clovis' Merovingian kingdom. During the 8th century in the Carolingian Empire the former area of Gallia Belgica was split into Neustria (roughly Belgica Secunda, main cities Paris, Reims) and Austrasia (roughly Belgica Prima, main cities Trier, Metz). After the death of Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, the Carolingian Empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. The three sons of Louis the Pious divided his territories into three kingdoms: East Francia (the forerunner of modern Germany), West Francia (<b>west</b> of the <b>Scheldt</b> river) a part of which (Ile de France), {{from the middle of the}} 10th century became the kernel of modern France, and Middle Francia which was succeeded by Lotharingia. Though often presented as the dissolution of the Frankish empire, it was in fact the continued adherence to Salic patrimony. Lotharingia was divided in 870 by the Treaty of Meerssen under West and East Francia.|$|R
40|$|At present, {{less than}} 2 % of the {{hinterland}} traffic to the harbour of Zeebrugge is carried by inland navigation, {{due to the}} insufficient capacity of inland waterway connections. An alternative could be offered by estuary vessels, i. e. inland vessels strengthened and equipped for safe operation between the Belgian coastal harbours and the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> in favourable weather and wave conditions. However, the window determined by the present regulations of the Belgian Shipping Inspectorate is too restrictive, traffic being impossible for 60 days a year on average. Accordingly, the Belgian federal authorities have recently prepared new regulations, based on probabilistic design procedures, including a risk analysis with respect to criteria which take due account of the limitations inherent {{to the design of}} inland vessels. Measures have been proposed by the Flemish authorities to stimulate the operation of estuary inland vessels for container transport from and to the coastal harbours, implying financial support for construction and exploitation...|$|E
40|$|The Belgian Federal Service for Mobility and Transport {{recently}} {{issued a}} draft proposal for new risk based regulations {{for the design}} of so-called estuary ships. These are basically inland waterways vessels strengthened and equipped {{to the extent that they}} can safely operate in the coastal waters between the <b>West</b> <b>Scheldt</b> estuary and the port of Zeebrugge when weather conditions are favourable. In an earlier version of the regulations the weather window was limited to sea states with significant wave heights up to 1. 2 m. The new rules allow operation in higher sea states, provided that the ship-owner presents a risk assessment study showing that the design of his ship meets all requirements in all sea states up to the proposed limiting seaway. As the new regulations are aimed at avoiding excessive ship motions, shipping of green water and wave impact loading, the risk analysis {{for the design of}} these ships can be based on well-proven linear strip theory calculations for the determination of wave loads and ship motions. Accordingly, a risk analysis procedure has been developed which is now being used for the actual design of such ships...|$|E
