Heliport perimeter lights are generally installed around the TLOF area an may be flush mounted on the TLOF itself or mounted just off the TLOF perimeter on short metal or concrete extensions. One alternative to lighting the TLOF if certain criteria is met is to light {{the area of the}} FATO instead. Some locations, due to environmental conditions, illuminate the TLOF and FATO. Lighting should never constitute an obstruction that a helicopter may impact and for this reason in the U.S. heliport lighting is not allowed to extend above the TLOF or FATO more than 2 inches. Current standards recommend that all perimeter lighting be green. Prior standards recommended amber lighting for perimeter lights however this wavelength has been shown to interfere with night vision goggle (NVG) operations when used with older incandescent lighting. In the past lighting has been traditionally incandescent but increasingly light emitting diodes (LEDs) are being incorporated due to lower power requirements and increased life. While flood lights may be used to enhance surface operations they should not interfere with flight crew night vision and should be kept off during flight operations and only used when conducting ground movement operations. To conduct night operations a lighted <b>wind</b> <b>cone</b> is also required.

Methods: We performed direct CS angiography in 105 patients with 22 posteroseptal APs and 83 APs in other regions, and 25 control subjects. We compared the diameter of the CS ostium in all subjects, and assessed the correlation of the local activation time in the patients with posteroseptal APs. Results: The proximal size (diameter) of the CS in the patients with posteroseptal APs (13 : 6 ± 1 : 1 mm) was larger than that in the patients with other types of APs (10 : 2 ± 1 : 8 mm [p < 0 : 001]) and that in the control subjects (9 : 6 ± 1 : 5 mm [p < 0 : 001]). Dilatation of the CS in the patients with posteroseptal APs extended up to 20 mm inside the CS.

The three NUV filters of Swift/UVOT enable us to probe in detail {{the properties of the}} extinction curve in the region around the 2175 A bump. The NUV colour-colour diagram strongly rules out a Calzetti-type law, which can either reflect intrinsic changes in the dust properties or in the star formation history compared to starbursts well represented by such an attenuation law. We emphasize that it is mainly in the NUV region where a standard Milky-Way-type law is preferred over a Calzetti law. The age and dust distribution of the stellar populations is consistent with the scenario of an encounter with M 81 in the recent 400 Myr. The radial gradients of the NUV and optical colours in the superwind region support the hypothesis that the emission in the <b>wind</b> <b>cone</b> is driven by scattering from dust grains entrained in the ejecta.

The research work was concened with the design of tension compensators for spinning-winding machines {{for the purposes of}} reducing winding tension variation during high speed <b>cone</b> <b>winding.</b> Initially, the research was directed to investigating the 'winding error', i. e. the difference between yarn supply and demand, which was the main cause of winding tension variation. Mathematical models were established to analyse the winding velocity variation and yarn path length variation. Several methods have been investigated to reduce winding tension variation and to develop tension compensators. These include using a servo motor to keep constant winding velocity and using a curved distribution bar to keep constant path length. Two promising tension compensators were selected for detailed investigation. they were a mechanical compensator and a mechatronic compensator. Based on the analysis of 'winding error', A multiple bar mechanism was devised, analysed and optimised to provide tension compensation. Further consideration has been given to a microprocessor controlled mechanism, that works according to predetermined look-up tables and sensor signals to reduce winding tension variation. The computer simulation of yarn winding process, the software design for the optimisation of mechanical compensator and the control of mechatronic compensator, and the results of winding tension experimentation are also presented in the thesis...|$|R

Despite the small size and intensity of Auckland eruptions, the risk from tephra fall is high {{because of the high}} density of buildings and lifelines. The nature of this threat can be evaluated by comparisons with historical Strombolian and Hawaiian eruptions, which have occurred in non-populated areas. Cone-building phases of such eruptions are typically protracted, i. e., weeks to months in duration, prolonging the period during which emergency managers will have to fine tune mitigation for numerous parameters such as fluctuations in intensity and <b>wind</b> shifts.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of two-dimensional stationary, line-driven winds from accretion disks in cataclysmic variable stars. The driving force is that of line radiation pressure, in the formalism developed by Castor, Abbott, & Klein for O stars. Our main assumption is that wind helical streamlines lie on straight cones. We find that the Euler equation for the disk wind has two eigenvalues, the mass-loss rate and the flow-tilt angle with the disk. Both are calculated self-consistently. The wind is characterized by two distinct regions, an outer wind launched beyond four white dwarf radii from the rotation axis and an inner wind launched within this radius. The inner wind is very steep, up to 80 ° with the disk plane, while the outer wind has a typical tilt of 60 °. In both cases, the <b>wind</b> <b>cone</b> dispersion is small because of a good alignment between {{the wind and the}} radiative flux vectors from the disk. We, therefore, provide an insight into the formation of the biconical geometry of disk winds as suggested by observations and kinematical modeling.

The flow critical points lie high above the disk for the inner wind but close to the disk photosphere for the outer wind. Comparison with existing kinematical and dynamical models is provided.

Although its spectral characteristics (WN 6) are currently {{very similar to those}} observed in 1995 in the FUV, some of the line fluxes continue with the increasing trend observed since the 1980 s.

40|$|Geomagnetic {{pulsations}} are {{ultra-low frequency}} (ULF) oscillations of the geomagnetic field {{that have been}} observed in the magnetosphere and on the Earth since the 1800 ’s. In the 1960 ’s in situ observations of the solar wind suggested {{that the source of}} pulsation activity must lie beyond the magnetosphere. In this work the influence of several solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) parameters on Pc 3 pulsations are studied. Pc 3 pulsations are a class of geomagnetic pulsations with frequency ranging between 22 and 100 mHz. A large dataset of solar wind and pulsation measurements is employed to develop two empirical models capable of predicting the Pc 3 index (an indication of Pc 3 intensity) at one hour and five minute time resolution, respectively. The models are based on artificial neural networks, due to their ability to model highly non-linear interactions between dependent and independent variables. A robust, iterative process is followed to find and rank the set of solar wind input parameters that optimally predict Pc 3 activity. According to the parameter selection process the input parameters to the low resolution model (1 hour data) are, in order of importance, solar wind speed, a pair of time-based parameters, dynamic solar wind pressure, and the IMF orientation with respect to the Sun-Earth line (i. e. the cone angle). Input parameters to the high resolution model (5 minute data) are solar <b>wind</b> speed, <b>cone</b> angle, solar <b>wind</b> density and a pair of time-based parameters. Both models accurately predict Pc 3 intensity from unseen solar wind data. It is observed that Pc 3 activity ceases when the density in the solar wind is very low, even while other conditions are favourable for the generation and propagation of ULF waves. The influence that solar wind density has on Pc 3 activity is studied by analysing six years of solar wind and Pc 3 measurements at one minute resolution. It is suggested that the pause in Pc 3 activity occurs due to two reasons: Firstly, the ULF waves that are generated in the region upstream of the bow shock does not grow efficiently if the solar wind density is very low; and secondly, waves that are generated cannot be convected into the magnetosphere because of the low Mach number of the solar wind plasma due to the decreased density. ...|$|R

40|$|The CHAMP {{magnetic}} field variations during international quiet days of low solar activity period 2008 - 2009 are investigated. The present paper reports {{the existence of}} frequency-peaks < 20 mHz in the compressional component of the {{magnetic field}} in almost all CHAMP passes. The magnetic field variations associated with these frequencies have amplitude of a few tens of nT during daytime. The geomagnetic activity and interplanetary magnetic field parameters were observed to be low {{during the period of}} study. The spectral powers of the observed frequencies show no dependence on solar <b>wind</b> velocity and <b>cone</b> angle; hence the reported frequencies are not related to the geomagnetic pulsations. For frequency-peaks < 15 mHz, strong local-time dependence is observed with maximum power near noon and minimum at night. The longitudinal and seasonal variations of the powers of these frequency-peaks match well with those of the equator-to-middle latitude ionospheric currents derived by the earlier studies. As a polar Low-Earth-Orbiting (LEO) satellite spans the entire range of latitudes within few minutes, it monitors the geomagnetic field variations caused by the quiet-time ionospheric currents flowing at different latitudes. This can result in certain frequencies in the magnetic field recorded by LEO satellites. We demonstrate that the frequencies < 10 mHz are mainly due to the latitudinal structure of the equatorial electrojet. The observed frequencies in CHAMP data are therefore attributed to the latitudinal structures of the ionospheric currents that are monitored only by the polar LEO satellites and are found to alter the observations of geomagnetic pulsations (Pc 4 - 5 and Pi 2) significantly.
