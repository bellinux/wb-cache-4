40|$|Duck meat has {{combined}} {{properties of}} red and white meat and has high nutritional values. Kerala with its network of inland water sources is an ideal place for duck rearing. A study was undertaken to compare the yields of native dual purpose Kuttanad ducks (5 - 6 months) with the exotic broiler strain of Vigova ducks (6 - 8 weeks) based on slaughter and carcass weight. When compared to Kuttanad ducks, Vigova ducks exhibited significantly higher slaughter and carcass weights, carcass yields with skin, without skin and <b>with</b> <b>giblets.</b> Mean value of breast angle and yield of inedible offals were significantly higher (P < 0. 01) for Kuttanad ducks. Cut up parts except back and wing were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) for Vigova ducks. In both groups, breast showed the highest mean yield. Leg constituted the second highest cut up part in Vigova ducks, whereas it was back for Kuttanad ducks. The lowest mean yield was for thigh in both the ducks. On the basis of carcass weight, yields of meat and bones were significantly higher for Kuttanad ducks, however, the meat: bone ratios did not differ significantly. Vigova ducks were superior in carcass yield and {{could be used for}} meat production at a young age, making it suitable for commercial broiler production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The insulin-like {{growth factor}} I {{receptor}} (IGF 1 R) {{has an important}} effect on growth, carcass, and meat quality traits in many species. However, few studies on associations of the IGF 1 R gene with growth and carcass traits {{have been reported in}} chickens. The objectives of the present study were to study the associations of the IGF 1 R gene with chicken early growth and carcass traits using a neutral test, variation scan of the gene, genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium and association analyses. Results The tree generated from the amino acid sequences of 15 species showed that the IGF 1 R gene was conservative in the whole evolution among the mammalian animals and chickens. In a total of 10, 818 bp of sequence, 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the chicken IGF 1 R gene. The allelic and genotypic frequency distribution, genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Xinghua and White Recessive Rock chickens showed that six of them were possibly associated with growth traits. Association analyses showed that the A 17299834 G SNP was significantly associated with chicken carcass body weight, eviscerated weight <b>with</b> <b>giblets,</b> eviscerated weight, body weights at 28, 35, and 56 d of age, leg length at 56 d of age, and daily weight gain at 0 – 4 weeks. The haplotypes of the A 17307750 G and A 17307494 G were associated with early growth traits. The haplotypes of the A 17299834 G and C 17293932 T were significantly associated with most of the early growth traits and carcass traits. Conclusion There were rich polymorphisms in the chicken IGF 1 R gene. Several SNPs associated with chicken early growth traits and carcass traits were identified in the IGF 1 R gene by genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and association analyses in the present study. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Results of {{the study}} of the effect of the level of non-degradable protein in diet on {{fattening}} performance and digestibility of nutrients in weaned lambs are presented in the paper. Objective {{of the study}} was to establish the optimal level of non-degradable protein in diets for weaned and intensively fattened lambs. Experiment was conducted on 60 lambs of F 1 generation: Pirot Pramenka x Wurttemberg x Ile de France, weaned at the age of 60 days and divided into three groups. The effect of use of three concentrated mixtures which differed in the share of protein non-degradable at the level of rumen: 43 % (I), 51 % (II) and 58 % (III). Average daily gain of lambs fed types of mixtures I:II:III was 0. 169 : 0. 205 : 0. 227 kg, respectively. Dry matter conversion (kg/kg of gain) on analogue treatments was: 4. 54 : 3. 71 : 3. 30, respectively, of energy (MJ NEM/kg) : 33. 77 : 29. 37 : 26. 25, and of total proteins (g/kg) : 732 : 596 : 549. Level of intake of proteins was not influenced by the treatment considering that the digestibility coefficients recorded were: 52. 58 % : 51. 30 % : 55. 12 %. With the increase of the share of non-degradable protein in concentrate mixtures, the tendency of increase of the digestibility of fat was present: 76. 13 : 77. 98 : 87. 17 %, as well as of decrease of the intake of fibre: 67. 40 : 45. 87 : 22. 39 % and NFE: 83. 87 : 76. 05 : 82. 96 %. Values of the dressing percentage of warm carcass <b>with</b> <b>giblets</b> according to nutrition types I:II:III were: 58. 70 : 58. 02 : 57. 42 %, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler {{carcasses}} lost greater weight when stored 4 {{days than}} when stored 1 or 3 days and lost greater weight after 6 and 8 days than after 4 days, particularly at high refrigerated storage temperatures. Carcasses stored at —. 5 C (31 F) lost significantly less weight than those stored above the freezing point of water. Whole carcasses lost significantly less weight than did cut-up carcasses. Carbon dioxide (C 02) -chilled carcasses lost less weight than did standard-immersion-chilled carcasses, because {{they picked up}} less water in the chilling process. The superficial freezing on C 02 -chilled carcasses delayed microbial growth and resulted in slightly longer shelf-life of C 02 -chilled carcasses than of those immersion chilled, particularly when comparisons were at higher refrigerated storage temperatures. Carcasses stored at 3. 9 C (39 F) had strong off odors by about 9 days of storage; at 1. 0 C (34 F) by about 14 days; and at- 2. 2 C (28 F) by about 35 days. Whole carcasses without giblets had a longer shelf-life than did cut-up carcasses, but whole carcasses stuffed <b>with</b> <b>giblet</b> packs had a shorter shelf-life than did cut-up carcasses...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of intermittent lighting (IL) on broiler growth and slaughter performance as well as serum biochemical and tibia parameters. Two hundred and eighty 7 -d-old Ross 308 broilers were selected and reared from 8 to 42 d under IL photoperiods of either 2 hours of light: 2 hours of dark (2 L: 2 D) or 4 hours of light: 4 hours of dark (4 L: 4 D), or under continuous lighting (CL). On day 42, body weight of broilers raised in the 4 L: 4 D photoperiod was significantly increased compared to those reared in the 2 L: 2 D photoperiod. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) of broilers in IL was significantly less than broilers in CL. The feed conversion of broilers raised in the 4 L: 4 D photoperiod was significantly more efficient than broilers in CL. The intestinal tract weight was greater in birds raised in the 4 L: 4 D photoperiod compared to birds in CL. Similarly, the eviscerated yield <b>with</b> <b>giblet</b> and eviscerated carcass weights in birds reared in the 4 L: 4 D photoperiod were significantly higher than corresponding weights observed in broilers raised in CL. Serum total protein concentration was distinctly higher in birds raised in the 4 L: 4 D photoperiod than that in the 2 L: 2 D photoperiod. In addition, the bone elastic modulus of birds reared in the 4 L: 4 D photoperiod was greater than measurements observed in the 2 L: 2 D photoperiod. Accordingly, we concluded that the 4 L: 4 D photoperiodic lighting schedule was superior to both the 2 L: 2 D photoperiod and CL in broiler production...|$|R
25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver <b>with</b> chopped <b>giblet,</b> ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|R

40|$|The aim of my {{work was}} to {{determine}} the influence of a higher content of nitrogenous substances in feedstuff on the growth, the quality of butcher-adapted body {{and the quality of the}} chicken's liver. The experiment comprised of 205 chickens of a hybrid combination ROSS 308. The chickens were divided into three groups. From the 14 th day of age each of the groups was given food with a different amount of nitrogenous substances [...] 20 %, 21 % and 22 %. This experiment was carried out on a farm in Čáčov and it lasted until the age of 42 days. Our trial proved that the best growth was recorded in the group with the 20 % content of nitrogenous substances (P< 0, 05). On the other hand, the worst feedstuff conversion was noticed in the chickens which got feed with the 22 % content of NL. Statistically provable difference (P< 0, 05) was also demonstrated in the weight of butcher-adapted bodies <b>with</b> cibarious <b>giblets</b> in the NL 20 and NL 21 groups compared with the NL 22 group. The content of dry mass in the breast muscle was statistically provable (P< 0, 05) higher in the NL 20 group compared with the NL 22 group. The level of NL had no influence on the content of abdominal fat and the fat in liver. Statistically provable (P< 0, 05) higher was the amount of L* in the NL 22 group in comparison with the NL 20 group and that happened in both cases meaning the liver in the NL 22 was darke...|$|R

40|$|PROAGRO is {{the leading}} firm in the broiler {{business}} in Venezuela. It is integrated through hatchery, grow-out, processing and distribution activities. As a consequence of strict price regulation policies enforced {{by the government in}} the poultry products, PROAGRO experienced serious injury to its profitability over the last few years. The most severe regulations were applied to PROAGRO's chief product (whole, ready-to-cook broiler <b>with</b> feet and <b>giblets</b> incorporated in the body cavity); therefore, PROAGRO's management has concentrated research efforts to find alternative ways to increase sales of products with larger margins through the most profitable distribution channels. At the present time the distribution channel with the biggest margin for broilers is through the restaurants specializing in broilers. PROAGRO sells 8 percent of its products to this kind of establishment, but recent efforts to increase distribution in these channels have had limited success due to intense competition from other poultry firms. An alternate way to increase broiler sales through "away-from-home" channels would be through an owned (or controlled) chain operation with high sales volume per unit. To accomplish this it would be necessary to offer faster service and lower prices of the products. These factors have been the basis of the fast-food concept developed successfully in the American market. This report will focus on the development of research methodology appropriate for (1) analyzing the Venezuelan market potential for fast-food poultry products and (2) evaluating PROAGRO's likelihood of increasing profits through entry into this business.
