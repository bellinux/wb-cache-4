5|$|Liubo: The {{now defunct}} board game liubo {{for the most}} part remains an enigma for modern {{scholars}} still deciphering exactly how it was played; its association with both gambling and divination make it a unique game. The earliest two liubo game boards are found in the Zhongshan Tomb 3 at Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Similar finds, dating from the mid 4th century BC, are also found in the Chu Tomb 197 and 314 at Jiangling, Hubei. Liubo game boards have been found in several Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) tombs; 1 <b>wooden</b> <b>board</b> at Jiangdu in Jiangsu; 1 <b>wooden</b> <b>board</b> in Tomb 8 at Fenghuangshan in Hubei; 1 lacquered set of liubo in Tomb 3 at Mawangdui Han tombs site in Hunan; 1 lacquered board in Tomb 1 at Dafentou in Yunnan; 1 bronze board at Xilin in Guangxi. During the Han Dynasty, an argument over the divination portents of the game {{as a result of a}} playing session led to a fight between a Western Han crown prince and Liu Xian (劉賢), where the latter was killed in the scuffle which (in part) prompted his father Liu Pi (劉濞), the King of Wu, to rebel against central Han authority in the Rebellion of the Seven States (154 BC). The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe asserts that the set pieces of liubo were symbolic of the forces of the Chinese Five Elements, wu xing.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney was a {{lifeboat}} station {{from around}} 1825 to 1924. Various wall plaques commemorate the boats' rescues and crew losses from 1862, when the RNLI {{took over the}} running of the service, up to the station's closure. There are two blue wooden boards from the RNLI listing the earlier lifeboats and their achievements; the Brightwell (1862), another Brightwell (1863), the Zaccheus Burroughs (1891), and the Hettie (1873). Next to these is a stone plaque listing the rescues from 1877 to 1924, including those of the last lifeboat, the Caroline (1908), and further along the north aisle a painting of George Long, coxswain of the Caroline, is placed above the record of its most famous rescues on consecutive days on 7 and 8 January 1918, when 30 people were saved from two steamers in a storm. A large <b>wooden</b> <b>board</b> acts as a war memorial, listing those locals who died in various military engagements. The clock in the west tower was donated by a Mrs Cooke in 1945 in memory of her late husband and sons.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{degradation}} behaviors and kinetics of five common <b>wooden</b> <b>boards</b> were studied by TG-DTG techniques at different heating rates 10 K/min, 15 K/min, 20 K/min, 25 K/min and 30 K/min in air atmosphere. The kinetic parameters, activation energy, of the degradation {{process for the}} <b>wooden</b> <b>boards</b> were calculated by means of Kissinger and Coats-Redfern methods. The {{results show that the}} whole course of pyrolysis of the five <b>wooden</b> <b>boards</b> can be divided into three phases and the main stage's activation energy of core-boards is the highest. It also shows that the results of Kissinger method are higher than Coats-Redfern's. The causes {{of the differences between the}} two methods and the probable factors causing errors during the experiment are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, {{there have}} been two main {{printing}} techniques in Asia: woodblock printing (xylography) and moveable type printing.

Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.|$|E

25|$|Much wood collage art is {{considerably}} smaller in scale, framed and hung as a painting would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a <b>wooden</b> <b>board.</b> Such framed, picture-like, wood-relief collages offer the artist {{an opportunity to}} explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and textural variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and {{taking advantage of the}} language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.|$|E
