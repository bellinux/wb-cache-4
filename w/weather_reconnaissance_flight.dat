50|$|On 17 January 1941, a German Heinkel He 111 bomber, {{modified}} as a meteorological aircraft, {{crashed on}} the island; wreckage {{remains on the}} crash-site to the present day. The aircraft had been flying on a routine <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flight</b> from its base at Oldenburg in Germany. It was intercepted by RAF Hawker Hurricane fighters from 3 Squadron, based at RAF Sumburgh; both of the aircraft's engines were damaged {{and several of the}} five crew were wounded. The pilot managed to make a crash-landing on Fair Isle to avoid ditching his crippled aircraft in the sea. Two crew died and three survived. The dead crew were buried in the island's churchyard; the survivors were detained by the islanders and remained for several days until weather conditions allowed them to be taken off the island by means of the Shetland Lifeboat.|$|E

5000|$|On 1 November 1950, the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (55 SRW) was {{activated}} {{under the}} Wing Base Organization at Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico as the {{headquarters for the}} 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Group and its supporting units. From 1950 to 1954 the Wing's task was to perform strategic reconnaissance, charting photography, precise electronic geodetic mapping, and electronic reconnaissance missions. In 1952, the wing moved to Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas and converted to Boeing RB-50 Superfortresses. On 13 March 1953, a wing RB-50 flying out of Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska was attacked by Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters near Siberia, but was able {{to ward off the}} fighter's attack with defensive fire. The United States protested the attack, stating the plane was on a <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flight</b> over international waters, 25 miles from the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Soviets responded by saying the plane was intercepted over their territory near Cape Krestovoi. A little more than three months later, on 29 July 1953 an RB-50 of the wing's 343d Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron was shot down by Soviet fighters about ninety miles south of Vladivostok. [...] The Soviet Union did not deny the plane's location was over water, but claimed that the bomber had twice flown over Soviet territory and fired on their MiGs, who then returned fire defensively.|$|E

While at Wormingford, the squadron flew unarmed <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights</b> in support of Eighth Air Force combat operations mission planning. Combat aircraft included B-24Hs and B-24Js from June 6 to August 24, 1944, and B-17Gs from September 8, 1944, to April 20, 1945.|$|R
5000|$|... 15 May - 12 December 1951: The {{squadron}} conducted its ﬁrst operational deployment to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan.

25|$|The {{squadron}} conducted some further flying {{after the}} end of the war. It dropped leaflets announcing the Japanese surrender over Japanese-held areas until 9 September and conducted a show of force over Kuching on 11 September. On 15 September, a No. 93 Squadron Beaufighter flew a film of the Japanese surrender at Singapore to RAAF Base Laverton and on 25 September the squadron was requested to destroy United States military barges with rockets. It also provided navigation escorts to single-engined RAAF fighters returning to Australia. The squadron's operation room was closed on 21 October but <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights</b> continued.

5000|$|The warm {{waters of}} the Pacific allowed the system {{continue}} to rapidly strengthen, becoming a Category 2 typhoon on August 18. At 8:00 that evening, Typhoon Fred strengthened to a Category 3 typhoon with winds of over 115 mph (equivalent to a U.S major hurricane). By midnight of August 19, Fred reached Category 4 intensity (winds greater than 130 mph on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale). Typhoon Fred reached its maximum intensity of 150 mph and a minimum central pressure of [...] <b>Weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights</b> conducted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center indicated that Super Typhoon Fred was in great size − 600 mi across.|$|R
5000|$|In 1944, four B-25Ds were {{converted}} for <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance.</b> One later user was the 53d <b>Weather</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Squadron, originally called the Army Hurricane Reconnaissance Unit, {{now called the}} [...] "Hurricane Hunters". <b>Weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> first started in 1943 with the 1st <b>Weather</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Squadron, with <b>flights</b> on the North Atlantic ferry routes.|$|R
50|$|It {{took these}} actions {{due to the}} fact that only two bomber squadrons {{remained}} in the Eleventh Air Force and the need to reduce the number of personnel. The 28th Bombardment Group on Shemya and the 343d Fighter Group at Alexai Point AAF, Attu, assumed the responsibilities of the two commands. The 404th Bombardment Squadron was responsible for conducting night reconnaissance missions over the Kuriles and flying a daily <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights.</b> The 77th Bombardment Squadron was held in readiness to repel a seaborne invasion and the fighter squadrons provided air defense. Air Corps supply and fourth echelon maintenance was carried on at the Alaska Air Depot at Elmendorf, and the normal paper-work, customarily handled by a Service command, devolved upon the Eleventh Air Force Headquarters.|$|R
50|$|The 25 He 111B and 33 He 111Es were {{supplemented}} late in 1939 {{with three}} He 111Js, which {{were used to}} fly <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights,</b> with three H models later being received from Germany for the same role, and a fourth aircraft received as a pattern aircraft for planned licence production. As World War II intensified in Europe, the Spanish Air Force suffered from fuel shortages, while the supply of spare parts for the He 111E's Jumo engines dried up, which resulted {{in most of the}} He 111Es being grounded from February 1942, placing a greater burden on the underpowered He 111Bs. The problems with the Jumo engines were solved by February 1946, however, allowing the He 111Es to return to regular service.|$|R
2500|$|After Japanese {{intruder}} and <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights</b> {{were detected}} on several successive nights, sixteen B-17s of the 14th and 93d Bombardment Squadrons were dispersed from Clark to Del Monte No. 1 {{on the night}} of 5–6 December, circling until dawn (5 December in the United States) before landing. They intended to remain only 72 hours because neither maintenance facilities nor barracks had yet been built, and only a single radio was operating. Two understrength ordnance companies from Clark had preceded them to Del Monte on 3 December and constructed their own camp in Tankulan, but the remainder of their personnel and all the materiel required, particularly aviation gas, did not depart Luzon until 10 December. For several months after hostilities began, work continued on another Del Monte strip in the barrio of Dalirig, [...] east of the bomber strip, and at crude but well-camouflaged dispersal fields located [...] to [...] further inland at Malaybalay, Valencia and Maramag in Bukidnon Province.|$|R
50|$|The 59th Reconnaissance Squadron, Very Long Range, Weather, was {{originally}} activated at Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma on 10 Aug 1945, equipped with Boeing RB-17G Flying Fortress reconnaissance aircraft. It quickly moved to Ardmore Army Air Field, Oklahoma {{and then on}} to Drew Field, Florida, followed by MacDill Field, Florida-all still in 1945. On 26 Jan 1946, the squadron moved to Castle Field, California; then again moved to Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field, California on 22 Oct 1946, where the Flying Fortresses were replaced by F-13As (a B-29 variant), for very long range <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights.</b> Three of the squadron's F-13As were earmarked for <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> duties in support of the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. In March 1946, three B-29s of the 59th had a variety of weather instruments installed at Tinker Field, and then departed for the Pacific and Operation Crossroads. On 25 May 1946, another F-13A of the 59th flew the first synopticweather reconnaissance mission from Castle over the northeastern Pacific. On 1 June 1947, the 59th moved to Ladd Field, Alaska, where it was inactivated on 15 October 1947; its personnel and aircraft being absorbed into the Strategic Air Command 72d Reconnaissance Squadron.|$|R

Performed air defense role over Okinawa during Chinese Civil War on the mainland during 1947-1950. Re-equipped with new F-82G Twin Mustangs in 1949, retiring war-weary F-61s in early 1950. Deployed flight of F-82s to Japan in June 1950 as part of Far East Air Force mobility upon breakout of Korean War. Engaged in combat operations over South Korea during 1950, until F-51D Mustangs and F-84 Thunderjets arrived in the Korean theater. Then few combat missions from Japan, rotating flights of F-82s from Okinawa during 1950-1951, largely performing long-range <b>weather</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>flights</b> over North Korea. Began receiving F-94C Starfire jet interceptors to replace F-82s in 1951, retiring the last of its Twin Mustangs in late 1951. Continued air defense mission of Okinawa until 1954; moving to Japan and taking over interceptor mission until 1954 flying first F-86D Sabres then F-102As. Also train pilots of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, the Republic of Korea and the Royal Thai Air Force, and flew combat missions over Korea and Vietnam.|$|R
