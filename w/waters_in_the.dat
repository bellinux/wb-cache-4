5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final.

25|$|One {{reason for}} {{considering}} it {{as a separate}} ocean {{stems from the fact}} that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other oceans. <b>Water</b> gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica. <b>Water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{observations}} {{variations of}} <b>the</b> bottom <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bear Island Channel and {{the faith of}} this <b>water</b> downstream <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian Sea is investigated <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> Atlantic Water flow into the Barents Sea. On the annual scale there is a marked seasonality both for temperature and current. The outflow of bottom <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bear Island Channel to the Norwegian Sea is at maximum during fall. <b>The</b> seasonal variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Inflow is less clear except of a marked minimum <b>in</b> April. <b>The</b> bottom <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bear Island Channel has become markably lighter since 1990 compared to the period 1965 - 89, and the trace of this <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian Sea has disappeared <b>in</b> terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> T-S plane.

5|$|The {{concentration}} of titanium {{in the waters}} of the Black Creek watershed is less than 0.17 milligrams per liter and the {{concentration of}} zirconium is less than 0.055 milligrams per liter. Small amounts (less than 0.01 milligrams per liter) of vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum also occur in the water. The cobalt concentration in mine <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed ranges from 0.07 to 0.93 milligrams per liter and the nickel concentration ranges from 0.09 to 1.2 milligrams per liter. Copper, silver, tin, and lead also occur in the watershed.|$|E

5|$|Anions in {{the waters}} of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of aluminum in the mine pools in the area are typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions {{in the waters}} can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E

"Why, when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea," [...] {{continued}} Forester, [...] "at {{the mouth}} of the river is very low, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river can flow off more readily, and this makes <b>the</b> <b>water</b> fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river itself. On the other hand, when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea is high, the water cannot run out from the river, and so it rises. Sometimes, <b>in</b> fact, <b>the</b> sea rises so much that the water from the sea flows up into the river, and makes it salt for a considerable distance from its mouth." ...|$|R
50|$|When a well is pumped, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> well is lowered. By {{lowering}} {{this water}} level, a gradient occurs between <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding aquifer and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> well. Because <b>water</b> flows from high to low water levels or pressure, this gradient produces a {{flow from the}} surrounding aquifer into the well.|$|R
25|$|Evidence of {{this kind}} shows that to {{increase}} the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tank, the qualitative kind of adiabatically performed work does not matter.

5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the pollution in the bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore <b>waters.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> middle of the storm, Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Dresden {{spent most}} of her career on foreign stations. After her commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 as part of Germany's {{delegation}} to the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. She returned to North American waters in late 1913, when she was stationed off the Mexican coast to protect German nationals during the Mexican Revolution. Following the rebels' victory the following year, Dresden evacuated the former dictator Victoriano Huerta to Jamaica, where the British had granted him asylum. In need of repairs, the cruiser was scheduled to return to Germany in July 1914, but the outbreak of World War I prevented this from taking place. Instead, Dresden operated as a commerce raider in South American <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic in the first months of the war before moving to the Pacific Ocean in September and thereafter joining Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron.|$|E
50|$|One strange {{phenomenon}} {{is the presence}} of both fresh and salt <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bay. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern and shallower part of the bay, which receives water from the Don River, is mostly desalinized.

There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before.
