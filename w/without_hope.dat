Once the allied army had reformed (and had been joined by Meldrum's and Denbigh's forces) they resumed the siege of York. <b>Without</b> <b>hope</b> of relief, and under the agreement that no Scottish soldiers were to be quartered in the city, the garrison surrendered on honourable terms on 16 July.|$|E

He interacted with the other film's cast and crew, since both were shot near the Battersea Power Station in Nine Elms. The cast who played Colonial Marines (except latecomer Michael Biehn) {{underwent}} several weeks of training with United States Marines <b>without</b> <b>Hope.</b> Director James Cameron said that he wanted Hope separated so he would be seen as an outsider, complementing Gorman's onscreen inexperience.|$|E
5|$|When the Mongols invaded Syria and {{threatened}} Damascus after conquering Aleppo in 1260, An-Nasir fled from Damascus, leaving the city virtually undefended. The notables of Damascus started {{negotiations with the}} Mongol ruler Hulagu Khan; the city was handed over to his general Kitbuqa in 1260. When the Mongol army left Damascus to quell rebellions in the countryside, the Ayyubid garrison of the citadel revolted, {{as they had been}} instructed to do by An-Nasir. In response, the Mongols besieged the citadel in 1260. The garrison surrendered after heavy bombardments and <b>without</b> <b>hope</b> of being relieved by An-Nasir. The defences of the citadel were then largely dismantled.|$|E

25|$|Henceforward, it will {{be found}} that the Royalist foot, now a {{thoroughly}} professional force, is superior in quality to the once superb cavalry, and not merely because its opportunities for plunder, etc. are more limited.

25|$|The {{resolution}} of the conflict was received with wide acclaim among the Thai people and {{was seen as a}} personal triumph for Phibun. For the first time, Thailand had been able to extract concessions from a European power, albeit a weakened one. For the French in Indochina, the conflict was a bitter reminder of their isolation following the Fall of France. In the French view, an ambitious neighbour had taken advantage of a distant colony cut off from her weakened parent. <b>Without</b> <b>hope</b> of reinforcements, the French had little chance of offering a sustained resistance.|$|E
25|$|Hell in Christian beliefs, is a {{place or}} a state in which {{the souls of the}} unsaved will suffer the {{consequences}} of sin. The Christian doctrine of Hell derives from the teaching of the New Testament, where Hell is typically described using the Greek words Gehenna or Tartarus. Unlike Hades, Sheol, or Purgatory it is eternal, and those damned to Hell are <b>without</b> <b>hope.</b> In the New Testament, it is described as the place or state of punishment after death or last judgment for those who have rejected Jesus. In many classical and popular depictions it is also the abode of Satan and of Demons.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory was}} {{followed}} by a rapid French advance. <b>Without</b> <b>hope</b> of relief, Tournai surrendered to Saxe on 21 May and the citadel of Tournai capitulated on 20 June. After Moltke's repulse at Melle, the capture of Ghent followed in mid-July with an immense amount of supplies and material along with its garrison consisting of 2,200 Dutch troops; and some 700 British troops. The allied field army, now reduced to 35,000 men, was less than half the number of the French and they fell back to Diegem in the vicinity of Brussels. Bruges and Oudenarde soon capitulated, {{and by the end of}} July the French stood on the threshold of Zeeland, the south-western corner of the Dutch Republic.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time that Kahlo was gaining {{recognition}} in her home country, her health continued to decline. By the mid-1940s, her back had worsened to the point that she could no longer sit or stand continuously. In June 1945, she traveled to New York for an operation in which a bone graft and a steel support were fused to her spine to straighten it. The difficult operation was a failure. According to Herrera, Kahlo also sabotaged her recovery by not resting as required, and further by once physically re-opening her wounds in a fit of anger. Her paintings from this period, such as Broken Column (1944), <b>Without</b> <b>Hope</b> (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer (1946), reflect her declining health.|$|E
25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew {{what he had to}} face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; {{in the grip of a}} relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. Without a word of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It was as if he was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as always, was constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress <b>without</b> <b>hope</b> of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from her}} autobiography, Bondfield {{contributed to a}} {{collection}} of essays entitled What Life Has Taught Me, in which 25 public figures pondered on the lessons of life. Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her [...] "strength to meet defeat with a smile, to face success with a sense of responsibility; to be willing to do one's best <b>without</b> <b>hope</b> of reward [...] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness". In March 1948 Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool in Lancashire, which provided subsidised holidays for low-paid women workers. In 1949 she made a six-month speaking tour of the United States, her final visit to the country; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service.|$|E

500|$|Fraser Nelson, {{editor of}} The Spectator, {{suggested}} the programme had highlighted {{a section of}} society who have been forgotten by the politicians: [...] "These people are people who otherwise don’t have a voice. They don’t vote, so for many years they have just not mattered". Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – {{through no fault of}} their own – to a life <b>without</b> <b>hope</b> or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays. In the Daily Mirror, entrepreneur John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, wrote that although Benefits Street did not fully represent the spectrum of people who claim benefits, it did show what could happen to those forgotten by the system [...] "who get caught in a kind of social suicide".|$|E
500|$|The two premiers {{were brought}} {{together}} in person in late January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for Sir Winston Churchill's funeral. Following an episode concerning Smith's non-invitation to a luncheon at Buckingham Palace after the funeral—noticing the Rhodesian's absence, the Queen sent a royal equerry to Smith's hotel to retrieve him, reportedly causing Wilson much irritation—the two Prime Ministers inconclusively debated at 10 Downing Street. They differed on most matters, but {{agreed on a}} visit to Rhodesia the next month by Bottomley and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Gardiner, to gauge public opinion and meet political and commercial figures. Bottomley and Gardiner visited Rhodesia from 22 February to 3 March, collected a wide cross-section of opinions, including some from black nationalists, and on returning to Britain reported to the House of Commons that they were [...] "not <b>without</b> <b>hope</b> of finding a way towards a solution that will win the support of all communities and lead to independence and prosperity for all Rhodesians". Bottomley also condemned black-on-black political violence, and dismissed the idea of introducing majority rule through military force.|$|E
500|$|This lyric was a {{reference}} to the Ballymun flats, a group of seven local authority, high-rise residential tower blocks built in the Ballymun neighborhood of Dublin during the 1960s. [...] Paul Hewson (later known as U2's lead vocalist Bono) had grown up on Cedarwood Road in the adjacent Glasnevin neighborhood, in a house across fields behind the towers, near his friends and future artists Fionán Hanvey (later known as Gavin Friday) and Derek Rowan (later known as Guggi). Bono had played in the towers' foundations as they were being built, then traveled in their elevators for the novel experience. Over time, poor maintenance, lack of facilities for children, transient tenancies, and other factors caused social conditions and communal ties to break down in the flats. The place began to stink of urine and vomit, and glue sniffers and used needles were common sights, as were appearances of the Garda Síochána. [...] Guggi later lived in the towers during years that he was struggling personally with drugs. It was through his exposure to people <b>without</b> <b>hope</b> in the flats that Bono began to develop his social consciousness.|$|E
