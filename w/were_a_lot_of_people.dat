500|$|... "Boys' Club" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. McCullers co-wrote two of the Austin Powers films and directed Poehler in the comedy film Baby Mama. The cold open scene, with kids throwing bags of dog feces at Leslie, {{was added to the}} episode after the rest had already been filmed, and was directed personally by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The bags were actually filled with mashed potatoes. Daniels said of the opening, [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who felt this was not in good taste, but to me, {{this was one of the}} most fun things about the show." [...] The restriction prohibiting Pawnee employees from accepting gifts over $25 was based on real-life municipal regulations the Parks and Recreation producers encountered during their research. The scenes filmed in the town hall outside courtyard were filmed on a studio sound stage, and the ethics board review scene was filmed inside the city hall building of Pasadena, California.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Carey described going under-cover as the stalker role: [...] "Well, {{we had a lot}} of people outside. I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> just standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool were Arsenal's {{opponent}} in the fifth round. The match, scheduled on 19 December 2006 at Anfield, was postponed by referee Martin Atkinson because of heavy fog. Atkinson's decision infuriated the managers of both clubs, with Rafael Benítez commenting: [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{looking forward to the}} game and it's really difficult to explain." [...] The tie was rescheduled for 9 January 2007 and on the night Arsenal took the lead when Aliadière scored in the 27th minute. Robbie Fowler equalised for Liverpool six minutes later. Later, two goals from Júlio Baptista and goal from Alex Song put Arsenal 4–1 ahead at half time. In the second half, Baptista completed his hat-trick; although Steven Gerrard and Sami Hyypiä scored to close the scoreline gap for Liverpool, Baptista added his fourth goal of the match in the 84th minute. The final score was 6–3, Liverpool's heaviest defeat at Anfield in 76 years. In his match report for The Guardian, Daniel Taylor praised Arsenal's reserve team and summarised: [...] "The difference between the two teams was immense. Arsenal played with flair and purpose; Liverpool were dishevelled and short of leadership." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{times on}} the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous {{experience}} that [...] "cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist" [...] and a [...] "300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane". Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. [...] "There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe," [...] she said. [...] "'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'" [...] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> on the set. Jim {{is not one of}} those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds," [...] he said. The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him [...] "Mij" [...] (Jim spelt backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, [...] "Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics." ...|$|E
500|$|Academic {{papers at}} ISMB were {{traditionally}} {{presented in a}} single track. Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on protein secondary structure prediction, sequence analysis and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively. As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks including multiple proceedings tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. Christopher Rawlings (head of Computational and Systems Biology at Rothamsted Research and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who {{wanted to keep it}} more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t." [...] As the number of submitted proceedings papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012. ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by AAAI Press. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal Bioinformatics. The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.|$|E

500|$|As late as July 1997, U2 were {{pressured}} {{to accept an}} offer of approximately $4million to perform in Basel, Switzerland on the date scheduled for the Sarajevo show. At the time, rumours about the region's instability persisted. To ensure the Sarajevo show was not canceled, Sacirbey appeared at many of the band's preceding shows to lobby {{on behalf of the}} city. For the stage to reach Sarajevo, the road crew had to drive the equipment and stage through war-torn Bosnia. Although the trip was without incident, they had to pass through towns such as Mostar, which had been [...] "obliterated" [...] during the war. Stage and lighting designer Willie Williams commented that [...] "when the truck drivers arrived you could see that they were changed men". The only trouble in transporting the stage came when a border control agent prevented them from crossing the border for hours. The trucks reached Sarajevo two days prior to the concert, arriving to the cheers and applause of the city's residents; their arrival was the first concrete evidence that the band were keeping their promise to play there. McGuinness explained, [...] "This is a city that's been disappointed so many times there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who weren't prepared to believe the gig was going to take place until they saw the stage going up." [...] Until then, tickets had sold very slowly, but within 24 hours of the trucks' arrival, another 8,000tickets were sold. Despite this, a day before the concert, 15,000tickets remained unsold. Three-hundred local residents were employed to help assemble the stage and promote the show.|$|E

Later that year, on June 13, she performed all of her biggest hits on VH1 Storytellers, including [...] "Fighter". Before performing the song, Aguilera revealed to the crowd, [...] "When I was younger there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> as I mentioned before, that were sort of around me for the wrong reasons.

[...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{also worked}} with several writers and {{producers}} on songs that {{failed to make the}} album. Toby Gad worked with Lewis including writing the song [...] "Unreachable" [...] with Lewis and Robbins. Taio Cruz was hired by Cowell to write and produce tracks for the album, and Irish Indie band The Script agreed to write a song, however, it was submitted too late. Production and songwriting team Xenomania were reported to have written five songs for Lewis's second album, described by songwriter Miranda Cooper as [...] "tragic songs with a twist." [...] Ne-Yo wrote songs for the album, including [...] "Can't Fight It". Lewis expressed interest in working with Chris Martin of Coldplay to give the album a rockier edge, though a collaboration never came to light. Several demos are said to be influenced by Coldplay, and Lewis collaborated with rock singer Aqualung. She was also reported to have worked with DJ Infamous, Claude Kelly, and Los Da Mystro. She worked with Timbaland in April 2009, and explained the reason for his tracks not appearing on Echo: [...] "I went in the studio with Timbaland and we vibed out.

I mean, it's something that I've always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it's just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of 'Oh, I can't.' They say it's taboo. It's ingrained in our heads that it's bad, when it's not bad at all. It's a very beautiful thing." [...] In a later interview for Out magazine's April 2010 issue, Armstrong stated: [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who didn't accept it, who were homophobic." [...] Armstrong continued, saying, [...] "The fact that it's an issue is kind of phobic within itself. At some point, you gotta think, this should be something that's just accepted."

[...] In February 2014, Armstrong again discussed his bisexuality in a Rolling Stone article about Dookie, a record which Armstrong described as [...] "touch on bisexuality a lot." [...] Armstrong discussed the song [...] "Coming Clean" [...] stating, [...] "It was a song about questioning myself. There are these other feelings you may have about the same sex, the opposite sex, especially being in Berkeley and San Francisco then. People are acting out what they're feeling: gay, bisexual, transgender, whatever. And that opens up something in society that becomes more acceptable. Now we have gay marriage becoming recognized...
