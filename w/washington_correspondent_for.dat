5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief <b>Washington</b> <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

25|$|Hersh {{was born}} on April 8, 1937 in Chicago to Yiddish-speaking Lithuanian Jewish parents who emigrated to the US from Lithuania and Poland and ran a dry-cleaning shop in Chicago's Austin neighborhood. After graduating from the University of Chicago with a history degree, Hersh found himself {{struggling}} to find a job. He began working at Walgreens before being accepted into University of Chicago Law School but was soon expelled for poor grades. After returning {{for a short time}} to Walgreens, Hersh began his career in journalism as a police reporter for the City News Bureau in 1959. He later became a correspondent for United Press International in South Dakota. In 1963, he {{went on to become a}} Chicago and <b>Washington</b> <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> the Associated Press. While working in Washington Hersh first met and befriended I. F. Stone, whose I. F. Stone's Weekly would serve as an initial inspiration for Hersh's later work. It was during this time that Hersh began to form his investigative style, often walking out of regimented press briefings at the Pentagon and seeking out one-on-one interviews with high-ranking officers. After a falling out with the editors at the AP when they insisted on watering down a story about the US government's work on biological and chemical weapons, Hersh left the AP and sold his story to The New Republic. During the 1968 presidential election, he served as press secretary for the campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.|$|E
500|$|Dunlap {{jumped to}} the New York Giants of the Players' League in late May 1890. At the time, the <b>Washington</b> <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> Sporting Life {{predicted}} that Dunlap would bring bad luck to his new team. He wrote: [...] "Fred is a great player, but the hoo-doo that seems to shadow him will make itself felt wherever he may go. There {{are a number of}} people in this vicinity who have watched his course with more than ordinary interest, and they do not hesitate to declare him a Jonah." [...] Dunlap appeared in only one game for the Giants and announced in July that he would play no more in 1890 and that he would spend the remainder of the summer at Atlantic City, New Jersey, with plans to return in 1891 [...] "and play the game of his life." ...|$|E
500|$|The furor fueled sales, {{with the}} Century later {{reporting}} that it gained 20,000 new subscribers {{because of the}} serial. The August issue of the Century, in which the first four chapters were serialized, sold out. [...] The September issue also sold out, but went to a second printing. The Century loudly proclaimed these facts in promotional advertisements, {{and that it was}} coining money as a result. As the second installment was read, and the character of Alice Belding became prominent, there was speculation in the press that a female hand had written the novel, with suspicion falling on Constance Fenimore Cooper (great-niece of James Fenimore Cooper), whose novels were set in eastern Ohio. On September 18, the <b>Washington</b> <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> the Evening Transcript noted the resemblance of Farnham's study to Hay's. Other candidates for the authorship were Howells (though he quickly denied it) and Hay's friend Clarence King, a writer and explorer.|$|E

500|$|The Democratic {{press was}} unimpressed by Harrison's nomination, and {{attacked}} {{him for not}} publishing his views on the main issues of the day, dubbing him [...] "General Mum". The New York Herald mocked the aging general, [...] "Mrs. Harrison of Ohio is undoubtedly a very excellent matron for her time, but if we must take a woman president, let's have youth and beauty, and not age and imbecility." [...] John de Ziska, <b>Washington</b> <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> the Baltimore Republican (a Democratic paper) who wrote under the initial Z, alleged that one particularly embittered Clayite had wondered how to [...] "get rid of" [...] Harrison, and the paper printed Z's suggestion: [...] "Give him a barrel of hard cider, and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it, he will sit {{the remainder of his}} days in his log cabin by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy." [...] This gibe was quickly reprinted by other Democratic papers.|$|E
