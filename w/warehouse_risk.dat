40|$|For {{the first}} time in 15 years, FX trading volumes {{contracted}} between two consecutive BIS Triennial Surveys. The decline in trading by leveraged institutions and "fast money" traders, and a reduction in risk appetite, have contributed to a significant drop in spot market activity. More active trading of FX derivatives, largely for hedging purposes, has provided a partial offset. Many FX dealer banks have become less willing to <b>warehouse</b> <b>risk</b> and have been re-evaluating their prime brokerage business. At the same time, new technologically driven non-bank players have gained firmer footing as market-makers and liquidity providers. Against this backdrop, FX trading is becoming increasingly relationship-driven, albeit in an electronic form. Such changes in the composition of market participants and their trading patterns may have significant implications for market functioning and FX market liquidity resilience going forward. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} achieve a safe and speedy logistics, this article {{assessed}} the logistics <b>warehouse</b> fire <b>risk.</b> Firstly, based on the logistics warehouse fire accidents, the four aspects of the logistics <b>warehouse</b> fire <b>risk</b> were gained. Secondly, the model was designed to assess the logistics <b>warehouse</b> fire <b>risk</b> by means of expert investigation and using the method of AHP and fuzzy comprehensive assessment. The target layer of logistics <b>warehouse</b> fire <b>risk</b> assessment model is logistics <b>warehouse</b> fire <b>risk.</b> The criterion layers, which are 4 parts, are the warehouse building, goods, management, environment. The 14 index layers {{are associated with the}} secondary indicators. By consulting experts, the weight of each index was constructed. The assessment model is applied to evaluate and analyze the logistics <b>warehouse</b> fire <b>risk.</b> This model was exemplified in a logistics warehouse. The results show that the assessment methodology of logistics <b>warehouse</b> fire <b>risk</b> is reasonable, effective and feasible...|$|R

40|$|Version 1. 00 Given {{the limited}} CDS market it is {{inevitable}} that CVA desks will partially <b>warehouse</b> credit <b>risk.</b> Thus realistic CVA pricing must include both <b>warehoused</b> and hedged <b>risks.</b> Furthermore, <b>warehoused</b> <b>risks</b> may produce profits and losses which will be taxable. Paying for capital use, will also generate potentially taxable profits with which to pay shareholder dividends. Here we extend the semi-replication approach in (Burgard and Kjaer 2013; Green and Kenyon 2014) to include partial <b>risk</b> <b>warehousing</b> and tax consequences. In doing so we introduce double-semi-replication, i. e. partial hedging of value jump on counterparty default, and TVA: Tax Valuation Adjustment. We take an expectation approach to hedging open risk and so introduce a market price of counterparty default value jump risk. We show that both <b>risk</b> <b>warehousing</b> and tax are material in a set of interest rate swap examples. “In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes” 1...|$|R
40|$|Differences in the {{organizational}} structure of CMBS loan originators may reflect {{differences in the}} incentives they face for underwriting risky loans.

40|$|The {{credit market}} turmoil since mid- 2007 has {{substantially}} affected {{the terms and}} conditions of funding in leveraged finance markets. Rising investor risk aversion, growing pressure on bank balance sheets {{and a loss of}} confidence in structured credit products have sharply reduced demand for leveraged loans. The materialisation of <b>warehouse</b> <b>risks</b> from failed leveraged loan syndications contributed to unwanted expansion of bank balance sheets and has affected credit supply. The knock-on effects from deteriorating conditions in leveraged loan markets have also affected private equity financing. Against the background of these developments, the working group report on private equity and leveraged finance markets under the chairmanship of Henk Brouwer of the Netherlands Bank addresses two broad questions. First, what have been the important trends during the period of rapid growth in the markets for leveraged finance, private equity and leveraged buyouts, and how has market growth affected incentives and corporate structures? Second, how have leveraged finance markets performed since mid- 2007, which risks have surfaced, and what preliminary lessons can be drawn for financial stability?. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Data {{warehouses}} {{are characterized}} in general by heterogeneous data sources providing information with {{different levels of}} quality. In such environments many data quality approaches address the importance of defining the term “data quality ” {{by a set of}} dimensions and providing according metrics. The benefit is the additional quality information during the analytical processing of the data. In this paper we present a data quality model for data warehouse environments, which is an adaptation of Markowitz’s portfolio theory. This allows the introduction of a new kind of analytical processing using “uncertainty ” about data quality as a steering factor in the analysis. We further enhance the model by integrating prognosis data within a conventional data <b>warehouse</b> to provide <b>risk</b> management for new predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|Insurance firms perform two key {{economic}} functions. First, they intermediate risk by marketing, {{selling and}} administering insurance policies. Second, they <b>warehouse</b> the <b>risks</b> underlying those policies. If viewed as separate businesses, intermediation and warehousing {{have very different}} risk profiles and characteristics. While intermediation is a function essential to the firm's role, the <b>warehousing</b> of those <b>risks</b> is mostly optional. It involves deciding to retain risks for the insurance firm's account rather than hedge the risk and thereby {{pass it on to}} a third party. The decision to retain or hedge risks is critical to a firm's financial outcomes. Insurance risks include underwriting factors like longevity, mortality and exposure to natural disasters. They also include economic factors like interest rates, currencies, counter-party default and equity markets. The consensus in the academic theory is that since insurance firms face significant frictional costs in raising capital, value-maximising firms will hedge all risks where the spread costs of the hedging instrument are low. This would seem to include most or all economic risks. As for underwriting risks, where hedging spreads are high, the decision will be a trade-off The firm will weigh up the reduced Risk-Bearing Costs offered by the hedging counter-party versus the Risk Transfer Costs incurred in these transactions. In practice it seems many firms hedge less than might be expected, retaining more economic and underwriting risk than may be explained by the theory. Factors which may be driving a bias towards risk are briefly explored, including regulatory drivers and an expectation of beating the market. Insurance-linked securitization offers benefits as a means of hedging risk and enhancing shareholder value through reduced Risk-Bearing Costs, although it faces informational problems that increase Risk Transfer Costs. Catastrophe Risk Bonds appear to have achieved a critical mass on the back of some historical capital shortages in the reinsurance industry. The life insurance securitization market could be poised for growth, but based on the history of Catastrophe Risk Bonds it may also require capital shortages in the life industry as a catalyst. Regulatory capital requirements will play a pivotal role in this regard. by Johann J. Strydom. Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 2011.

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the warehouse credit providing business is limiting fraud on <b>warehouse</b> lending. Main <b>risks</b> of fraud include dishonest and collusive mortgage loan originators, title companies, real estate agents and customers themselves, false information in the loan application (especially appraisals), forged signatures on the loan documents, and false documents of title. The 'Wet funding' type of warehouse credit is riskier in terms of possible fraud because the credit provider will not be aware of any potential problems until after the funds are sent to the loan originator. Measures that the warehouse lender can take to limit fraud can be a strong screening process for mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies, making sure the loan originator itself has a strong internal screening process, limiting the amount available for 'wet funding', and having separate account for funds coming from sale of loans to investors.|$|R

50|$|Agricultural {{value chain}} finance is {{concerned}} with the flows of funds to and within a value chain {{to meet the needs of}} chain actors for finance, to secure sales, to buy inputs or produce, or to improve efficiency. Examining the potential for value chain finance involves a holistic approach to analyze the chain, those working in it, and their inter-linkages. These linkages allow financing to flow through the chain. For example, inputs can be provided to farmers and the cost can be repaid directly when the product is delivered, without need for farmers taking a loan from a bank or similar institution. This is common under contract farming arrangements. Types of value chain finance include product financing through trader and input supplier credit or credit supplied by a marketing company or a lead firm. Other trade finance instruments include receivables financing where the bank advances funds against an assignment of future receivables from the buyer, and factoring in which a business sells its accounts receivable at a discount. Also falling under value chain finance are asset collateralization, such as on the basis of <b>warehouse</b> receipts, and <b>risk</b> mitigation, such as forward contracting, futures and insurance.|$|R
40|$|Warehouse {{financing}} {{has emerged}} as one of the most promising financing approaches for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Its basic working mechanism is to transfer the company's assets to collaterals which are more acceptable by the banks. In this paper, we take the position of illustrating how a logistics service provider, the 3 rd Party Logistics (3 PL), can transform into a financing service provider to coordinate and control the financing logistics processes. With the professional 3 PL's help, it is much easier for SMEs to get loan from a bank. In the meantime, the 3 PL's business opportunities will be increased by providing financing service in addition to their traditional logistics based functions. This paper first compares different available financing technologies and points out that warehouse financing is one of the most effective financing means for SMEs. After introducing the basic working mechanism of <b>warehouse</b> financing, the <b>risk</b> analysis framework is developed by applying SCOR reference model to identify the financing activities and associated risks. The implementation cost of this approach is reviewed. Future work will be devoted to product and service design for 3 PLs based on the warehouse financing mechanism. An outlook for applying this approach for risk analysis in carbon trading and financing is also presented. © 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The {{recent changes in}} the European business environment appear, to this company, {{as an opportunity to}} gain new market share towards East European countries, particularly Hungary and the Czech Republic. The purpose of this research was to study what could be the optimal design of a distribution structure towards the markets in Hungary, the Czech Republic and one particular area in East Germany. We decide to look at the design of the current distribution network, and to compare two alternative distribution network designs. While analyzing the business case, we suggest solutions and improvements according to the following perspective: cost, flexibility, location of <b>warehouses,</b> and the <b>risks</b> of reduced customer service level. In a first part we review the theory used in the thesis. Then we present the gathered data, on an organized approach that support a further analysis, concerning the current situation. In a third part we analyze the results obtained from gathering the empirical data. This part includes also a cost simulation of the two alternatives; therefore a discussion about the soft factors is added. The results showed the centralized alternative much cheaper than any other distribution network design. The solution with the merged local warehouse in East Europe located in Prague is more able to adapt itself to further change in the market. Keeping the current situation is the solution that includes the least amount of risk for a reduced customer service level. In the conclusion we tried to relativize the cost comparison we got, and make the reader aware of the uncertainties in the thesis. In the conclusion we also gave possible implementations to improve the business of Mölnlycke Health Care.

40|$|Detecting {{fraudulent}} {{and abusive}} cases in healthcare {{is one of}} the most challenging problems for data mining studies. However, most of the existing studies have a shortage of real data for analysis and focus on a very limited version of the problem by covering only a specific actor, healthcare service, or disease. The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a novel framework to detect fraudulent and abusive cases independently from the actors and commodities involved in the claims and an extensible structure to introduce new fraud and abuse types. Interactive machine learning that allows incorporating expert knowledge in an unsupervised setting is utilized to detect fraud and abusive cases in healthcare. In order to increase the accuracy of the framework, several well-known methods are utilized, such as the pairwise comparison method of analytic hierarchical processing (AHP) for weighting the actors and attributes, expectation maximization (EM) for clustering similar actors, two-stage data <b>warehousing</b> for proactive <b>risk</b> calculations, visualization tools for effective analyzing, and z-score and standardization in order to calculate the risks. The experts are involved in all phases of the study and produce six different abnormal behavior types using storyboards. The proposed framework is evaluated with real-life data for six different abnormal behavior types for prescriptions by covering all relevant actors and commodities. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values are presented for each experiment. Moreover, a cost-saving model is also presented. The developed framework, i. e., the eFAD suite, is actor- and commodity-independent, configurable (i. e., easily adaptable in the dynamic environment of fraud and abusive behaviors), and effectively handles the fragmented nature of abnormal behaviors. The proposed framework combines both proactive and retrospective analysis with an enhanced visualization tool that significantly reduces the time requirements for the fact-finding process after the eFAD detects risky claims. This system is utilized by a company to produce monthly reports that include abnormal behaviors to be evaluated by the insurance company...|$|R
40|$|A {{strategic}} {{imperative for}} Amgen {{is to increase}} the number of patients that have access to the company's lifesaving medicines. As part of this goal, Amgen is launching a new manufacturing site in Singapore (ASM). Reliability of supply and quality control will be critical factors for successful ASM launch; therefore, this project will focus on two key objectives: optimization of raw material flow for the ASM <b>warehouse,</b> and transportation <b>risk</b> mitigation of disposable bioreactor bags. Optimization of warehouse operations helps ensure the site can supply enough drug substance to meet the needs of patients worldwide. ASM has a warehouse that is 1 / 3 the size of a traditional biologics manufacturing warehouse, and is projected to reach capacity during commercial production, increasing risk for the site and incurring the cost of outsourcing storage. A Warehouse Capacity Model was developed using inventory management principles, and then used to identify operations strategies that provide the greatest improvement in warehouse utilization for ASM. Transport risk mitigation for disposable bioreactor bags is critical to the manufacturing process, because ASM is using disposable technology throughout their drug manufacturing process. Even a pin-sized hole can lead to contamination and significant lost revenue. To reduce the risk to these bags during shipping, a twelve-member, cross-functional team was formed, consisting of experts at Amgen from seven different functional groups, including materials science and supply chain, to partner with the supplier to establish a transportation qualification plan for the 2000 L bioreactor bag. Transport risk mitigation of bioreactor bags also reduces the required amount of storage, since fewer bags will need to be stored as safety stock. The transport qualification of 2000 L bags was successfully executed, and the process was documented to guide future transportation qualification plans for disposables. The key recommendations are that in the short-term, ASM should hold materials with suppliers with warehouses in Singapore, increase frequency of delivery of materials, and utilize random storage location assignment. In the longer term, ASM should utilize storage from suppliers and Third Party Logistics Providers (3 PL). For future warehouses, the Warehouse Capacity Model should be used in the design phase to give the team sufficient time to implement recommendations. For future transportation qualification plans for disposables, a pressure decay method is recommended for more robust testing of bag integrity. In addition, creation of a "library" of defects is recommended to improve visual inspections. by Maxine Yang. Thesis: M. B.
