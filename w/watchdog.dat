40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{traditional}} UNIX {{file system}} provides operations whose semantics are fixed at file system implementation time. <b>Watchdogs</b> are userlevel processes that can extend the ûle system to achieve user-defrned file system semantics on a perfrle basis. <b>Watchdogs</b> provide only those functions that need special handling. Other operations proceed through the normal file system, unimpeded by {{the existence of}} <b>watchdogs.</b> We describe a prototype implementation of <b>watchdogs</b> {{that has been used}} to build several useful applications. Although only a prototype, the system has acceptable performance. This work took place while the authors were supported by NSF Grants No. DCR- 8420945 and CCR- 86 I I 390.

5000|$|The <b>Watchdogs</b> (various voices) - The <b>Watchdogs</b> {{are small}} eyeball-headed creatures {{that serve as}} Hater's minions and {{the bulk of his}} army. They are loyal to their master, but are {{frequently}} distracted by Wander's interference, particularly as their [...] "enemy" [...] treats them better than their ruler. Many episodes of the show focus on the <b>Watchdogs,</b> showing that they are all unique individuals. Westley (Appearing in [...] "The Little Guy), who left the Hater Empire to travel the galaxy after being inspired by Wander and Sylvia. Andy (Appearing in [...] "Eye on the Skullship") runs a web series for the <b>Watchdogs,</b> in which he interviews them and allows them to discuss their lives on Lord Hater's Skullship.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Watchdogs</b> are {{dedicated}} to restoring and preserving traditional American culture and values, and fighting against indecency, immorality, and sexual perversion. The <b>Watchdogs</b> seek to impose their conservative moral views on the general public; they believe in strict enforcement of family values, and are violently opposed to pornography, obscenity, sex education, abortion, homosexuality, and the teaching of evolutionary theory. Their terrorist activities, which include vandalism, arson, intimidation, assault, kidnapping, brainwashing, and murder, are targeted primarily at people who produce material which the <b>Watchdogs</b> consider pornographic, including nude art and sexually explicit music.|$|R
5|$|In October 2009, New Zealand's {{independent}} environmental <b>watchdog,</b> Jan Wright, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, made a {{submission to}} the Select Committee considering National's {{amendments to the}} NZ ETS.

5|$|It is an energetic, free-spirited breed. Even {{though it}} is a gundog, it is also kept as a {{companion}} dog because of its easy-going nature and devotion to the cause. It is a cheerful, active dog and is always ready to play, responding to any form of attention with a happily wagging tail. Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good <b>watchdog,</b> and are amiable with children.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1990s, {{the breed}} was almost unknown outside of Russia, and so {{relatively}} few details on associated health issues are known. The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter {{and as a}} <b>watchdog,</b> and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter. It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the family unit. Due to its size and similarities to the chihuahua, the two are often compared.|$|E

5|$|In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles {{study by}} former fellows of a {{conservative}} think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal <b>watchdog</b> group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan, cited flaws in the study's methodology.|$|E

France 2 and Enderlin issued a writ two days later.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good <b>watchdog</b> due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E

5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as a <b>watchdog</b> as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E

Johnson and Simmons remove James's wristwatch, but he betrays them to the <b>Watchdogs</b> with the promise that they would kill him once he helped destroy the other Inhumans—James hates himself and his Inhuman identity.

5|$|The {{temperament}} of the West Highland White Terrier {{can vary}} greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude. It {{will not tolerate}} rough handling such as a child pulling on its ears, and can be both food- and toy-possessive. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good <b>watchdog.</b> It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15–30 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true <b>watchdog.</b>|$|E
