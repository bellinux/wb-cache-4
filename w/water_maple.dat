40|$|Summary Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that the large earlywood vessels of ring-porous trees can be extraordinarily vulnerable to cavitation making it necessary that these trees maintain a consistent and favorable water status. We compared cavitation resistance, vessel refilling, transport capacity and water status in a study of ring-porous Quercus gambelii Nutt. (oak) and diffuse-porous Acer grandidentatum Nutt. (maple). These species co-dominate summer-dry foothills in the west-ern Rocky Mountains of the USA. Native embolism measure-ments, dye perfusions and balance pressure exudation patterns indicated that the large earlywood vessels of 2 – 3 -year-old oak stems cavitated extensively on a daily basis as predicted from laboratory vulnerability curves, resulting in a more than 80 % reduction in hydraulic conductivity. Maple branches showed virtually no cavitation. Oak vessels refilled on a daily basis, de-spite negative xylem pressure in the transpiration stream, indi-cating active pressurization of embolized vessels. Conductiv-ity and whole-tree water use in oak were between about one-half and two-thirds that in maple on a stem-area basis; but were similar or greater on a leaf-area basis. Oak maintained steady and modest negative xylem pressure potentials during the growing season despite little rainfall, indicating isohydric water status and reliance on deep soil <b>water.</b> <b>Maple</b> was mark-edly anisohydric and developed more negative pressure poten-tials during drought, suggesting use of shallower soil water. Al-though ring porosity may have evolved as a mechanism for coping with winter freezing, this study suggests that it also has major consequences for xylem function during the growing season...|$|E

30|$|Although it is {{well known}} that sap {{exudation}} during early spring in temperate deciduous trees occurs in response to daytime warming and nighttime cooling, the mechanisms of the process are not yet fully understood. Previous theories suggested that changes in stress in the wood caused by daytime heating and nighttime cooling might be linked with sap flow. Consequently, a study of itaya-kaede maple (Aver mono) and shirakamba birch (Betula platyphylla var.japonica) looked at tangential strains. One-hour intervals for 3 years of the tangential strains on the inner bark of stem and root were measured in itaya-kaede maple and shirakamba birch during the sap exudation season. The measurements indicated different mechanisms of sap exudation in these two trees. During the sap exudation season in late March, when the temperature fluctuated around 0 °C, the tangential strain in the root of itaya-kaede maple showed expansion in the daytime and contraction at night. Conversely, in early April the tangential strain in the root of shirakamba birch exhibited contraction in the daytime and expansion at night. The changes in tangential strains in itaya-kaede maple were attributed to conditioning, a known concept used to explain the uptake mechanism of soil <b>water</b> in <b>maple</b> and its exudation during early spring. However, because the change in tangential strain in the roots of shirakamba birch was similar to that found during the rampant season, sap exudation was not attributed to conditioning but to the plentiful supply of water from the roots. The implications of these mechanisms are that different sap harvesting techniques may be appropriate for different tree species.|$|R
60|$|The Indians were fond {{of honey}} and maple sugar. The finding of a hive of bees, {{or a good}} run of maple syrup was an {{occasion}} for general rejoicing. They found the honey in hollow trees, and they obtained the maple sugar in two ways. When the sap {{came up in the}} maple trees a hole was bored in the trees about a foot from the ground and a small tube, usually made from a piece of alder, was inserted in the hole. Through this the sap was carried into a vessel which was placed under the tree. This sap was boiled down in kettles. If the Indians had no kettles they made the frost take the place of heat in preparing the sugar. They used shallow vessels made of bark, and these were filled with <b>water</b> and the <b>maple</b> sap. It was left to freeze over night and in the morning the ice was broken and thrown away. The sugar did not freeze. When this process had been repeated several times the residue was very good maple sugar.|$|R
5000|$|Shelford's law of {{tolerance}} is a principle developed by American zoologist Victor Ernest Shelford in 1911. It states that an organism's success {{is based on}} a complex set of conditions and that each organism has a certain minimum, maximum, and optimum environmental factor or combination of factors that determine success.C. The further elaboration on the theory {{of tolerance}} is credited to Ronald Good. 1. Points out the second limitation of Liebig's law of the minimum - that factors act in concert rather than in isolation. A low level of one factor can sometimes be partially compensated for by appropriate levels of other factors. a. A corollary to this is that two factors may work synergistically (e.g. 1 + 1 = 5), to make a habitat favorable or unfavorable. 2. Geographic distribution of sugar maple. a It cannot tolerate average monthly high temperatures above 24-27 °C or winter temperatures below −18 °C. The western limit is determined by dryness, and this coincides with the western limits of forest vegetation in general. b. Because temperature and rainfall interact to determine the availability of <b>water,</b> sugar <b>maple</b> tolerates lower annual precipitation at the edge of its northern range (by about 50 cm). 3. Good restated the theory of tolerance as: Each and every species is able to exist and reproduce successfully only within a definite range of environmental conditions. 4. The law of tolerance, or theory of tolerance, is best illustrated by a bell shaped curve. a. The range of the optimum. 5. Tolerance ranges are not necessarily fixed. They can change as: a. Seasons change. b. Environmental conditions change. c. Life stage of the organism changes. Example - blue crabs. The eggs and larvae require higher salinity than adults. 6.

In the spring of 1995, three trees of each species were moved with a tree spade to a new location within a field nursery and three nontransplanted trees were selected as controls. Predawn leaf water potential, morning-to-evening stomatal conductance and leaf temperature, leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference, midday stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, and growth data were collected over a 2 -year period.
