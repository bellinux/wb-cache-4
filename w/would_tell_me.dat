5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
500|$|In {{a modern}} {{development}} of the tale the green children {{are associated with the}} Babes in the Wood, who were left by their wicked uncle to die; in this version the children's green colouration is explained by their having been poisoned with arsenic. Fleeing from the wood in which they were abandoned, possibly nearby Thetford Forest, the children fell into the pits at Woolpit where they were discovered. Local author and folk singer Bob Roberts states in his 1978 book A Slice of Suffolk that [...] "I was told there are still people in Woolpit who are 'descended from the green children', but nobody <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who they were!" ...|$|E
500|$|Grissom {{was born}} as {{an only child}} to a middle-class family in Santa Monica, California. Grissom's father taught botany at a local college and passed his enthusiasm for natural {{sciences}} onto his son. His father died when Grissom was 9 years old. Grissom recalls the day his father died to Catherine Willows in the episode [...] "Still Life", [...] "He came home from school, one hot humid day, laid down on the couch. I was watching TV, my mom brought in some cold drinks, but she couldn't wake him up. No one <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> why." [...] Consequently, as a young child, Grissom played doctor by performing necropsies on small, deceased animals in the local area.|$|E

500|$|By the 1951 season, media sources {{had given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Big Four" [...] to the pitching combination of Garcia, Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Early Wynn. Garcia had learned to control the curveball that Harder taught him in spring training of 1949. Harder said that Garcia already had a terrific fastball, but that he became a good pitcher by learning the curveball and working on his control. Cleveland sportswriter Hal Lebovitz wrote, [...] "Garcia, {{until the day he}} died, <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how much of the success he owed to Harder." [...] Garcia also once admitted to throwing an occasional spitball, an illegal pitch. [...] "Maybe a dozen in my life. I'm sure plenty of the great pitchers did", he said.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 {{and worked}} on the film with the filmmakers {{on a daily basis}} for almost two years. He {{considered}} it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, [...] "I would sit with Pete [...] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Donnell has {{remarked that}} he [...] "sat {{with the level}} {{designers}} and 'spotted' the level {{as though it was}} a movie, with the knowledge that the music would have to be malleable rather than static.... he level designer <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what he hoped a player would feel at certain points or after accomplishing certain tasks." [...] Based on this information, O'Donnell would [...] "go back and develop appropriate music cues, then have the designer script the cues into the level, and then we'd play through it to see if it worked as desired." [...] He explained that the use of music in Halo is sparse because he believes that [...] " [...] is best used in a game to quicken the emotional state of the player and it works best when used least," [...] and that [...] " [...] music is constantly playing it tends to become sonic wallpaper and loses its impact when it is needed to truly enhance some dramatic component of game play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fisher {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with singer James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: [...] "Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes {{from a long line of}} soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garbo never married, had no children, {{and lived}} alone as an adult. Her most famous romance {{was with her}} {{frequent}} co-star, John Gilbert, with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927. Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her acting on the set, teaching her how to behave like a star, how to socialize at parties, and {{how to deal with}} studio bosses. They costarred again in three more hits, Love (1927), A Woman of Affairs (1928), and Queen Christina (1933). Gilbert allegedly proposed to her numerous times, with Garbo agreeing but backing out at the last minute. [...] "I was in love with him," [...] she said. [...] "But I froze.

2500|$|Forty years later, Holloway's son was {{responsible}} for interviewing the eminent lawyers, businessmen, and government officials who applied {{for membership in the}} exclusive Metropolitan Club of the City of Washington between 1988 and 1992. [...] "I was truly amazed at the number of these prospective members who asked if I were any relation to the admiral who founded the Holloway Plan," [...] recalled the younger Holloway, by then a famous admiral in his own right. [...] "When I answered yes, they <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that they wouldn't be sitting there today if it weren't for the Holloway Plan....It had put them through collegeschools like Princeton, Duke University, Caltech, and Stanford. After the Korean War and Vietnam, the opportunities were so great on the outside that many of them left the service and became quite successful in their civilian careers." ...|$|E

The couple remained married for 45 years until her death after a brain aneurysm on June 25, 2011. Everett credited his family with being a stabilizing force in his life, stating that even in the worst of times, Grant [...] "never threatened to leave. She <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that she was there for me. If not for my family, I would have been in big trouble." [...] Grant noted his romanticism; he sent her so many flowers during their courtship that [...] "my balcony looked like a burial ground." [...] He also often wrote sentimental poems to Grant throughout their marriage, as well as to his daughters. The couple renewed their marriage vows every seven years.|$|E
2500|$|In his May 2014 {{interview}} with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government {{of trying to}} use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a [...] "low level analyst." [...] In his words, he was [...] "trained as a spy {{in the traditional sense}} of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." [...] He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure [...] "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." [...] In a June {{interview with}} Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he [...] "was actually functioning at a very senior level." [...] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, [...] "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting." [...] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, [...] "I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> their hardest technology problems, and it was my job {{to come up with a}} way to fix them." ...|$|E
