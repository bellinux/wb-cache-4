[...] Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", calling it [...] "How Will I Know II", spoken at Hollywood's blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for Los Angeles Times, regarded the album as [...] "another commercial blockbuster", writing that the record is [...] "a series of highly accessible selections that will work {{on a variety of}} radio formats." [...] However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that Whitney did precious little to define the singer's vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn't assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of The Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: [...] "Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice takes us to places we know and to places <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> to forget and to places we dream about." [...] But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting [...] "There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring." [...] St. Petersburg Times showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating [...] " [...] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it's easy to be cynical about. But as products go, this is a pretty good one." [...] They also praised her vocals as follows: [...] "Houston's voice sounds good, real good. [...] She's firmer, more confident." ...|$|E

40|$|Environment matting is a {{powerful}} technique for modelling the complex light-transport properties of real-world optically active elements: transparent, refractive and reflective objects. Zongker et al [1999] and Chuang et al [2000] show how environment mattes can be computed for real objects under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.

However, at 5.10 a.m. we struck north, over a low divide of trap hill, by a broad and evidently made road, and regained the Wady el-Kubbah: here it is a pleasant spectacle rich in trees, and vocal with the cooing of the turtle-dove.

Through revisiting five systems in which appropriation has happened {{both within and outside}} the intended use, we are going to show how it can be possible to design with open surfaces. These open surfaces have to be such that users can fill them with their own interpretation and content, they should be familiar to the user, resonating with their real world practice and understanding, thereby shaping its use.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the synthesis of}} reactive systems from specifications with identifiers. Identifiers are useful to parametrize the input and output of a reactive system, for example, to state which client requests a grant from an arbiter, or the type of object that a robot is expected to fetch. Traditional reactive synthesis algorithms only handle a constant bounded range of such identifiers. However, in practice, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> to restrict the number of clients of an arbiter or the set of object types handled by a robot a priori. We first present a concise automata-based formalism for specifications with identi-fiers. The synthesis problem for such specifications is undecidable. We therefore give an algorithm that is always sound, and complete for unrealizable safety spec-ifications. Our algorithm is based on computing a pattern-based abstraction of a synthesis game that captures the realizability problem for the specification. The abstraction does not restrict the possible solutions to finite-state ones and captures the obligations for the system in the synthesis game. We present an experimental evaluation based on a prototype implementation that shows the practical applica-bility of our algorithm. ...|$|R
