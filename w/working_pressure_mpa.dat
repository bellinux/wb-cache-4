40|$|Abstract. The {{outskirts}} oilfields of Daqing Oilfield have {{characteristics of}} deep volcanic reservoirs, compact and complex lithology, and low natural yield of single gas well, {{so it is}} necessary to fracture these outskirts oilfields for exploitation. The traditional layer-by-layer fracturing gas test technique has low construction efficiency and poor reconstruction effect. Considering physical properties of compact gas reservoirs, conditions of wells and indexes of downwell tools, this paper studies and designs a layered fracturing string for deep compact gas reservoirs. It comprises high-index fracturing packer and matching downwell tools. The high-pressure compact gas reservoirs can be reconstructed layer by layer and on a large scale without moving string. The field construction shows that this string can meet requirements of formation temperature 180 ℃ and <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> 100 <b>MPa,</b> and it can finish maximum 130 m 3 layered constructions thereby significantly reducing the field construction...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of an adsorptive natural gas (ANG) vessel pressurized continuously with light hydrocarbon gases and their mixture at 27 Â°C was analyzed using two different activated carbons. Activated carbon AC-L showed better isothermal storage capacity than AC-D {{due to its}} sufficient porous structure. However, higher adsorption capacity claimed more extreme thermal fluctuation represented by a temperature rise of 99. 2 Â°C at the center region of the bed charged continuously with methane at 1 L minâˆ’ 1 up to <b>pressure</b> of 4 <b>MPa,</b> corresponding to 82. 5 Â°C in AC-D bed. Higher charge rate of 5 L minâˆ’ 1 claimed severer thermal fluctuation of 116 Â°C in AC-L/methane system calling for a serious reduction of 26. 9 % in the dynamic storage capacity {{with respect to the}} isothermal storage capacity. This reduction brought the storage system to a <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of about 2. 5 MPa rather than the desired <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of 4 <b>MPa</b> (about 40 % reduction in storage pressure). The severest temperature rise was at the center region caused by bed poor thermal conductivity leading to limited heat transfer.

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) applications require lightweight actuators that can generate a high force {{in a limited}} volume. Among pressure driven actuators, fluid elastic actuators demonstrate high potential {{for use in the}} medical field. They are characterized by nearly no friction and wear and they can be made of low-cost biocompatible elastomers. However, when compared to traditional piston-cylinder fluid actuators, fluid elastic actuators often result in smaller output forces as well as weaker return forces. This work is about the design of a linear elastic actuator (LEA) which is able to develop relevant pulling-pushing force in one direction. The LEA is composed of entirely disposable materials and it requires a simple manufacturing process. Thanks to its design, the LEA can be compared to traditional piston-cylinders actuators in terms of output forces (up to 7 N) with the advantage of using relative low <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> (0, 2 <b>MPa).</b> The actuator has been used for the actuation of a gripper for MIS, as a case study. The whole range of gripping forces developed by the tool actated by the LEA has been evaluated, thus verifying that the gripping device, is able to meet the force requirements for accomplishing typical surgical tasks...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} apparatus {{has been}} designed to study the phase behavior of fluid mixtures of relevance to CO 2 -enhanced oil recovery and carbon dioxide storage in deep aquifers or depleted oil fields. The fluid phases are circulated by means of a dual-channel magnetically-coupled pump and aliquots may be withdrawn from the re-circulation loops, by means of high-pressure sampling valves, for analysis by gas chromatography. The high-pressure cell is fitted with a special probe that may be rotated in order to draw liquid into the re-circulation loop from different heights within the cell, thereby permitting the study of three-phase vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria. The working temperature range of the apparatus is from (298 to 448) K and the maximum <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> is 50 <b>MPa.</b> In this work, measurements have been made on the binary system (CO 2 + H 2 O) at temperatures from (298. 15 K to 448. 15 K) and pressure from (1. 5 to 18. 0 MPa), and the results are compared with the available literature data. Vapor-liquid-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibrium points were also measured at T = 298. 15 K. Standard uncertainties were 0. 04 K for temperature, 0. 04 % of reading for pressure, and typically 3 × 10 - 4 and 8 × 10 - 4 for the mole fractions in liquid and vapor phases respectively. The results have been correlated by means of an asymmetric approach based on the Peng-Robinson equation of state, for the vapor phase, and an extended form of Henry’s law incorporating the NRTL solution model, for the aqueous liquid-phase. The ability of the Krichevsky-Kasarnovsky (KK) approach to correlate the data has also been evaluated...|$|R
