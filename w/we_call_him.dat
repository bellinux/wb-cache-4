500|$|However, Disney {{found that}} the new Pinocchio was too {{helpless}} and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, {{in the summer of}} 1938 Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally the cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy, and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions. Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. Ward Kimball had spent several months animating a [...] "Soup Eating Sequence" [...] in Snow White, which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket. Kimball conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears. [...] "The only thing that makes him a cricket is because <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> one," [...] Kimball later joked.|$|E
500|$|Jack is bisexual, and is {{the first}} {{televised}} Doctor Who character to be openly anything other than heterosexual. In Jack's first appearance, the Doctor suggests that Jack's orientation {{is more common in}} the 51st century, when humankind will deal with multiple alien species and becomes more sexually flexible. [...] Within Doctor Whos narrative, Jack's sexual orientation is not specifically labelled as that could [...] "make it an issue". On creating Jack, Davies comments [...] "I thought: 'It's time you introduce bisexuals properly into mainstream television,'" [...] with a focus on making Jack fun and swashbuckling as opposed to negative and angsty. Davies also expresses that he didn't make the character bisexual [...] "from any principle", but rather because [...] "it would be interesting from a narrative point of view." [...] The bisexuality-related labels [...] "pansexual" [...] and [...] "omnisexual" [...] are also frequently applied to the character. Writer Steven Moffat suggests that questions of sexual orientation do not even enter into Jack's mind; Moffat also comments [...] "It felt right that the James Bond of the future would bed anyone." [...] Within Torchwood, the character refers to sexual orientation classifications as [...] "quaint". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, John Barrowman explained that [...] "’s bisexual, but {{in the realm of the}} show, <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> omnisexual, because on the show, [...] also have sex with aliens who take human form, and sex with male-male, women-women, all sorts of combinations." [...] The term is also used once, in-universe, in the novel The House that Jack Built, when Ianto comments to a woman's remark about Jack, [...] "He prefers the term 'omnisexual'." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} two decades - when most of the works shown here were made – the {{activities}} of the poster designer, the printmaker, the illustrator, and the film director have completed each other. Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually he did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" [...] as a way of thinking, or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.
