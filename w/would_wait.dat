5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, {{the object of the}} game was to touch the ball on the opponent's end of the pool. The goalkeeper <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> {{at the end of the}} pool until an opposing player approached the goal, when the goalkeeper would try to stop that player, for example, by dunking their head.|$|E
5|$|Although both Malaysia and Singapore {{had agreed}} to respect and accept the ICJ's decision, Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking {{permission}} to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1977 {{issue of}} Starlog, Roddenberry {{said he was}} not sure when the novel would be complete, but {{confirmed}} that it would discuss the meaning of God. By March 1978, the novel was said to be half-completed. Publisher Bantam Books told Roddenberry it <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> until he finished production on Phase II to resume work on the novel. When later in 1978 that production turned into The Motion Picture, Bantam gave Roddenberry an extension because the novelization was thought to be a full-time effort.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{there were}} four trains daily in each direction, reduced to three on holidays. The most {{important}} train {{was the one that}} coordinated with the west-bound steam ship; the train <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> up to 45 minutes if the ship was delayed. This become the dominant route for people to get from Stavanger to cities along the South Coast, as well as to Oslo. In addition to passengers, major cargo shipments included seasonal shipments of herring, as well as lumber from the surrounding areas. Coal for the trains was imported by steam ship to Flekkefjord.|$|E
5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, {{with a side}} room called the pound, where new prisoners <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> until a room was found for them. The front lodge led to a {{courtyard}} known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the common side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed {{by the sight of}} abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

5|$|The ICJ's {{decision}} is final and {{not subject to}} appeal. Nevertheless, in June 2008 Rais Yatim stated that Malaysia had renewed its search for the letter written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K.

5|$|The attack would {{consist of}} a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a {{blocking}} force west of Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, who Saddam Hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.|$|E
5|$|The square Little Stair Tower was the {{entrance}} from the bailey to the withdrawing rooms {{south of the}} great hall. At ground floor level there was a doorway {{in each of the}} tower's faces. Directly south of {{the east side of the}} tower was the castle's chapel. The northern door led to the great hall, and the western door to a cellar under the great chamber. There are only fragmentary remains of the spiral staircase. Above the passageway was a single room, of uncertain purpose: it may have been used as another chapel, a guest room, or an antechamber where guests <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> before being admitted into the earl's presence.|$|E

5|$|By {{early spring}} of 1794, the {{situation}} in France was dire. With famine looming after {{the failure of the}} harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> for them. According to contemporary historian William James this conglomeration of ships was said to be over 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).|$|E
5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E

5|$|The {{day before}} bookings {{for the film}} opened, a {{reported}} crowd of 100,000 gathered outside the Maratha Mandir to buy tickets. The tickets, the most expensive for a Bollywood film at that time, were dockets containing text, photographs and trivia about the film, and are now considered collector's items. They sold for 100 (valued at about US$21 in 1960), compared to the usual price of 1.5 (US$0.31). Bookings experienced major chaos, {{to the extent that}} police intervention was required. It was reported that people <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> in queues for four to five days, and would be supplied food from home through their family members. Subsequently, the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|With Butler's {{chances for}} the presidential {{nomination}} waning, Breckinridge convinced the Kentucky delegation to the 1852 Democratic National Convention not to nominate Butler until later balloting when he might become a compromise candidate. He urged restraint when Lewis Cass's support dropped sharply on the twentieth ballot, but Kentucky's delegates <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> no longer; on the next ballot, they nominated Butler, but he failed to gain support. After Franklin Pierce, Breckinridge's second choice, was nominated, Breckinridge tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Douglas to Pierce's cause. Pierce lost by 3,200 votes in Kentucky—one of four states won by Winfield Scott—but {{was elected to the}} presidency, and appointed Breckinridge governor of Washington Territory in recognition of his efforts. Unsure of his re-election chances in Kentucky, Breckinridge had sought the appointment, but after John J. Crittenden, rumored to be his challenger, was elected to the Senate in 1853, he decided to decline it and run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transfer}} of political power, the Rhodesian Army, ZANLA and ZIPRA began to be merged to form the new Zimbabwe National Army. ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel were mixed into new battalions, guerrillas were picked out for officer training, and old Rhodesian units were variously disbanded or earmarked for reform. In some cases the latter meant only a change of symbolism and nomenclature; the Rhodesian Air Force, for example, remained almost all white as the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Every one of the approximately 34,000 guerrillas was promised {{a place in the}} new army. In the meantime they <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> in respective ZANLA and ZIPRA assembly camps around the country with pay and rations identical to those of black privates in the old Rhodesian forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, Hector Duff {{wrote of}} how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba {{district}} of Angoniland <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> at dawn outside people's huts and attack {{them when they}} opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps. Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, {{where they have been}} known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|Command of A Company was {{temporarily}} {{handed over to}} the second-in-command, Captain Bob Murdoch. Present at Pakchon in November 1950, O'Dowd understood first-hand the dangers of withdrawing while in contact. The challenge was to protect the forward platoons as they withdrew from being followed up by the Chinese occupying the old B Company positions and from D Company's position after they broke contact. The Australians would also have to clear the withdrawal route of any blocking forces, {{while at the same time}} the evacuation of a large number of wounded and Chinese prisoners would hamper their movement. As such the timing of the withdrawal would be critical to its success. Consequently, the lead company would not move until mid-afternoon so that the rearguard would be able to use the protection of darkness to break contact, while at the same time offering good observation and fields of fire during the daylight to support the initial moves. Orders were delivered at 14:30. B Company would lead the withdrawal down the ridge line, carrying any wounded that still required evacuation, as well as clearing the route and securing the ford near the Middlesex position. C Company <b>would</b> <b>wait</b> for the artillery to neutralise the Chinese on the old B Company position, before moving to establish a blocking position behind D Company. A Company would then withdraw to a blocking position behind C Company, in order to allow Gravener and Saunders to establish a clean break. Finally, D Company would withdraw through both C and A Company and set up a blocking position to delay any follow up and allow those companies to withdraw.|$|E
