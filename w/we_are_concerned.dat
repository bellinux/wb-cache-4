By Newton's third law of motion, the force on the slower liquid is equal and opposite (no negative sign) to the force on the faster liquid. This equation assumes that the area of contact is so large that we can ignore any effects from the edges and that the fluids behave as Newtonian fluids.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{either from}} {{religious}} belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> with a Creator or the substratum which underlies {{our experience of}} phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, {{he thought that the}} Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.|$|E
