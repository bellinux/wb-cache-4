5|$|Legendary {{stories of}} pig-faced women {{originated}} roughly simultaneously in Holland, England and France {{in the late}} 1630s. The stories told of a wealthy woman whose body was of normal human appearance, but whose face <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pig.|$|E

50|$|Falco's species <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raptor, {{most likely}} a falcon called a red-throated caracara. His general head shape suggest <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raptor, but one {{interesting}} characteristic, which traces {{back to the early}} character designs, is his color. While his shape <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird <b>of</b> prey, his colors <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pheasant. Material recently revealed in interviews with designers reveals <b>that</b> Falco <b>was</b> actually originally intended to be a pheasant.|$|R

Both head-dresses show two lateral perforations, 1-2 cm in diameter.|$|R
5|$|After {{stepping}} down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, {{and was named}} the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> figurehead with little actual authority, but he {{was used as a}} mediator to resolve league disagreements. In {{the second half of the}} decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physician {{in the nineteenth}} century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition {{as the result of}} experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crisis, {{a point in}} the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

His eyes are able to bewitch {{both men and women}} alike, and he has relatively strong magical powers. He has the ability to purify water and cleanse toxins.|$|R
5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 'community where every {{individual}} {{was encouraged to}} feel {{that she had a}} real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> somewhat older man than the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger that led the producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing career <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical journeyman, owing {{mostly to}} the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, {{before moving on to}} Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E

5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years. Barry's most famous rescue <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young boy. He found the child asleep in a cavern of ice. After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Agnew {{graduated}} as Bachelor of Laws {{and passed}} the Maryland bar examination. He started his own law practice in downtown Baltimore, but was not successful, and {{took a job as}} an insurance investigator. A year later, he moved to Schreibers, a supermarket chain, where his main role <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> store detective. He stayed there for four years, a period briefly interrupted in 1951 by a recall to the army after the outbreak of the Korean War. He resigned from Schreibers in 1952, and resumed his legal practice, specializing in labor law.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Worsley {{was part}} of a yacht and ship {{delivery}} company, Imray Laurie Norie & Wilson Limited. His personal experience was a key selling point in the company's commercial literature. In 1937, the company completed over 50 delivery voyages. The longest delivery <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steamer destined for Hong Kong, which took three months. On many of these voyages he was accompanied by Jean, who also enjoyed sailing.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad Ahmad died of typhus a {{few months}} after his victory, leaving power to his three deputies, or Kalifas. Abd al-Rahman was born on 15 July 1885 in Omdurman, three weeks after his father's death. His mother was granddaughter of a former Sultan of Darfur, Mohammed al-Fadl.

5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{the more}} elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> classified video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.|$|E

5|$|The McClintock {{expedition}} {{also found}} a human skeleton on the southern coast of King William Island. Still clothed, it was searched, and some papers were found, including a seaman's certificate for Chief Petty Officer Henry Peglar (b. 1808), Captain of the Foretop, HMS Terror. However, since the uniform <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship's steward, {{it is more likely}} that the body was that of Thomas Armitage, gun-room steward on Terror and a shipmate of Peglar, whose papers he carried. At another site on the western extreme of the island, Hobson discovered a lifeboat containing two skeletons and relics from the Franklin expedition. In the boat was a large amount of abandoned equipment, including boots, silk handkerchiefs, scented soap, sponges, slippers, hair combs, and many books, among them a copy of The Vicar of Wakefield. McClintock also took testimony from the Inuit about the expedition's disastrous end.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|The {{last known}} {{observation}} of the frog in the wild <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single male heard calling (but not seen) in 2007.
