2500|$|Morse {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} for a career in the vaudeville of the West Coast. She left Kooskia—and her husband Elmer—behind for good. Her brother Glen later observed, [...] "she left home when we were barefoot and had the best suite in a Portland hotel <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Katy Steele's father Rick Steele {{is a local}} blues {{musician}} {{in various}} cover bands, and her brothers Jesse and Luke were both members of The Sleepy Jackson. Jesse left the band in 2000. Steele was the singer-songwriter and guitarist in her band, The Plastik Scene. A friend of Luke's, Simon Leach, heard Steele singing at her brother's 21st birthday party. [...] "Katy was always there... She was around 15 <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> sing. Three years later, Katy and I were playing together." [...] Steele left her band and, with Leach as drummer, they performed several gigs as a duo. Scott ('Barney') O'Donoghue later offered to play bass guitar. Leach became tired of percussion and began playing guitar when Matt Chequer joined on drums. In 2002 Little Birdy was formed, named after the Ween song of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Rose's thoughts, {{ideas and}} {{concerns}} {{were taken into}} consideration {{when it came to}} finalizing Tiana's design. [...] "I … said I wanted it to look like she ate and wasn’t skinny, and she has a full mouth and a little round nose and curly hair and these are all things that made her look distinctly herself," [...] she said. Rose didn't want Tiana to resemble [...] "a cookie-cutter princess who had been coloured in brown. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{for the first time and}} realized how much she looked like me I was really blown away." [...] Rose also served as a form of visual, live-action reference for supervising animator Mark Henn as he worked on Tiana, videotaping her as she recorded her lines and incorporating some of her distinct characteristics, such as her dimples and left-handedness, into Tiana's design.|$|E
6000|$|... "How should I?" [...] I replied, {{resolved}} {{to imitate the}} princess in her fidelity. [...] "How should <b>I,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> before?" ...|$|R
60|$|First night <b>when</b> first <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.|$|R
6000|$|... "The head of Lady Charlemont (<b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> {{nine years}} ago) [...] seemed to possess all that {{sculpture}} could require for its ideal." ...|$|R
60|$|Naomi {{disappeared}} after dinner. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> again, she {{had some}} news for me.|$|E
60|$|I used my {{knowledge}} of this phase of spiritual pathology, and set down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy, or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> yesterday, I was horrified <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> today.|$|E
6000|$|... "Health!" [...] exclaimed Edgar, {{striving to}} look and speak in a {{comparatively}} indifferent manner. [...] "She was quite well <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> last." ...|$|E
60|$|I cannot tell in {{any words}} {{what the state}} of my mind was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>her</b> hand my {{handkerchief}} with which I had covered the dead baby.|$|R
6000|$|BLY. Well, I {{like to see}} {{green grass}} and a blue sky; but it's a mistake in a 'uman bein'. Look at any young chap that's good-lookin'--'e's doomed to the screen, or hair-dressin'. Same with the girls. My girl went into an 'airdresser's at {{seventeen}} and in six months she was in trouble. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>'er</b> with a rope round her neck, as you might say, I said to meself: [...] "Bly," [...] I said, [...] "you're responsible for this. If she 'adn't been good-lookin'--it'd never 'eve 'appened." ...|$|R
60|$|At first I {{read with}} some {{constraint}} and shyness, but presently warming to my task and growing interested, I became animated and vivacious in my manner, so that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ceased <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> sitting there, her hands clasped about one knee, her eyes upon my face, her lips parted a little, the very picture of interest.|$|R
60|$|I can {{scarcely}} tell {{the sense of}} shame that filled me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> fall. Alas! I could not stir to help her.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> though I spake not to her, nor she to me, yet {{straightway}} {{my heart}} {{knew that she}} would love me not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is a merry creature,' said Lady Morton, 'her spirits {{never seem}} to flag, and I think she is looking {{stronger}} than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> last.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was going}} down, {{all in a}} bunch, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> and the next instant she touched the bottom. Her feet were under now, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> make a little spring. She just pushed out her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't. But I {{always thought}} of her as little Elsie--she was a girl <b>when</b> <b>I</b> left home. I can {{understand}} what struck your brother: I felt it myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> after <b>I</b> came back." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary was {{standing}} at her father's elbow, as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> and she gazed wistfully at my flute, as {{she would not have}} done had she seen me in my proper attire, assuming my proper character.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I guess she's got a {{good right}} to be. I wasn't certain whether it was her or Miss Saunders first <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Joan answered. [...] "I was too late. She {{had died}} the night before. I hardly {{recognized}} her <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> She looked so sweet and young." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so, in a way, {{but five}} minutes was long enough. I knew I'd never marry anybody else <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{in the garden}} the first day I came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have heard, indeed, {{that she}} is uncommonly {{improved}} within this year or two. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Darcy, {{who could}} contain himself no longer, [...] "but {{that was only}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> for it is many months since I have {{considered}} her {{as one of the}} handsomest women of my acquaintance." ...|$|R
60|$|Her veil {{was down}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> Her {{features}} and her expression were but indistinctly visible to me. I could just vaguely perceive {{that she was}} young and beautiful; but, beyond this, though I might imagine much, I could see little.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cliff laughed. [...] "You {{are very}} prompt," [...] said she, [...] "and I {{think you will}} find Willy in the little parlor. She was sewing there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> last." ...|$|E
60|$|She simply {{raised her}} veil and {{sank into the}} nearest chair. I was {{staggered}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> face. It was positively haggard, {{and her eyes were}} burning. She looked at me almost with horror.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} how it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{trotting}} off so often to the Jews' quarter. 'You see too much of Anton Trendellsohn,' I said to her; but it didn't do any good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Monsieur Sommers, I doubt {{not that}} you would. As to your {{reference}} to my daughter, you forget {{that she was a}} little child <b>when</b> <b>I</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> so <b>I</b> have no experience of a father's powers of penetrating disguises." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Mrs. Berry, and <b>when</b> Cutler and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> we both {{ran away}} {{as fast as}} our legs could carry us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it," [...] he said. [...] "I {{was sure}} you were Agnes' daughter, for you are the living image {{of what she was}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> Child, you don't know me, but I am your Uncle Robert. Your mother was my half-sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. If you'll write, I'll sign," [...] said Cecil. [...] "Mother said I ought <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> in London, but she didn't order me. She {{said she}} {{left it to}} my proper feeling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [The {{latter part}} of this sonnet was a great {{favourite}} with my sister S. H. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> lying in death, I could not resist the impulse to compose the Sonnet that follows it.--I. F.] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{latter part}} of the first of these was a great {{favourite}} with my sister, Sara Hutchinson. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> lying in death, I could not resist the impulse to compose the sonnet that follows.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> next <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> her mask was on once more. Miss Meadowcroft was herself again. Miss Meadowcroft {{could sit}} by, impenetrably calm, while the lawyers {{discussed}} the terrible position of her brothers, with the scaffold in view {{as one of}} the possibilities of the [...] "case." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I watched Renuka Shahane die in {{the film}} on a Friday. I waited with bated breath until Sunday morning to catch her on Surabhi, the {{cultural}} magazine show on Doorsdarshan which she hosted then. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> alive, <b>I</b> had tears in my eyes," [...] he recalled.|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as {{the door}} was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with <b>her</b> hand. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>her</b> high spirits had failed, I at once took {{advantage}} of her reaction to make a diagnosis.|$|R
