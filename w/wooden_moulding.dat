He describes an experiment in which a steel ball was rolled down a groove in a piece of <b>wooden</b> <b>moulding</b> 12 cubits long (about 5.5m) with one end raised by one or two cubits. This was repeated, measuring times by accurately weighing the amount of water that came out of a thin pipe in a jet from the bottom of a large jug of water. By this means he was able to verify the uniformly accelerated motion. He then shows that whatever the inclination of the plane, the square of the time taken to fall a given vertical height is proportional to the inclined distance.|$|E
5000|$|Although framing {{borders in}} ancient art {{were used to}} divide scenes and {{ornamentation}} by ancient Egyptian and Greek artists in pottery and wallpaintings, the first carved wooden frames {{as we know them}} today appeared on small panel paintings in twelfth and thirteenth century Europe. According to a historical series published in Picture Frame Magazine, these early [...] "framed panel paintings were made from one piece. The area to be painted was carved out, leaving a raised framing border around the outside edge, like a tray. The whole piece was then gessoed and gilded. Painting the image on the flat panel was the last thing to be done."When it was realized this method of producing a frame and the image within in one slab of wood was too costly, [...] "a more efficient method was eventually developed which used mitred moulding strips. These strips were attached to a flat wooden panel which produced a similar result to the carved panel, but were more cost effective. This type of frame is known as an engaged frame. The early ones were made of simple <b>wooden</b> <b>moulding</b> strips attached to the outside edge of a wooden panel." ...|$|E
5000|$|The picture-framing mat is most {{commonly}} known by laymen {{for its use}} as additional decoration to enhance {{the look of a}} framed piece, sometimes in conjunction with a fillet or more rarely, liners made of <b>wooden</b> <b>moulding</b> with a cloth surface.

Typically the mat or mats, if matched carefully and properly proportioned, serve to help draw the eye in towards the framed piece, or towards a particular key element of the piece. However, while the mat is usually regarded as something to complement or set off the artwork to best effect, or not to interfere or compete with it (neutral-colored mats are often preferred by high-end art galleries), there are some examples of the mat being regarded by the artist {{as a part of the}} artwork. Mats can be decorated as described below, used as a surface for the continuation of the artwork within, or can incorporate three-dimensional aspects, though the last two are highly unusual.|$|E

5000|$|Hawley {{said that}} he had no {{interest}} in history until 1950, when he visited a customer to demonstrate a machine. While at the customer's premises, he noticed a joiner's brace of a design that he had not seen before and was able to acquire it. Perhaps the most significant single development to his collection came in 1965 when he paid a business visit to the William Marples company and discovered that the firm's plane-manufacturing workshop was being close. The Marples company was the last maker of a specific type of wooden plane and Hawley asked whether he could have some examples. According to Simon Barley, writing an obituary in The Guardian: [...] Before long he was carting off the entire contents of the workshop in his Volvo estate. [...] "The only thing left was the benches," [...] he said, and after a phone call to the owner he took those as well. [...] But more than just collect the artefacts, what Hawley realised was that knowledge of the skills of <b>wooden</b> <b>moulding</b> plane-making would be lost with retirement of Albert Boch, the last plane maker at Marples. So, he recruited two cine-camera enthusiasts to help him film Albert Boch making a plane from start to finish; and he went on to make other short films showing surviving makers in a range of tool manufacturing trades in their working environment before they became extinct. He also considered trade catalogues and other ancillary items an important record and illustration of the range of products, many of which have no surviving examples, and these were added to his acquisitions [...]|$|E

If the paskha is cooked, this mass is then heated. The pan containing the mixture is then placed in a container of cold water and progressively cooled. Afterwards it is placed in a tradional <b>wooden</b> <b>mould</b> assembly called pasochnitsa (пасочница), with a layer of cheese cloth protecting the <b>mould.</b> The <b>wooden</b> <b>mould</b> can be taken apart for cleaning; however, more modern materials, such as plastics, are used nowadays.

Therefore, each pan had its own individual furnace and chimney, which the lumpman was responsible for controlling. <b>Wooden</b> <b>moulds</b> were filled with salt crystals from the pans to produce a hard block (lump) of fine salt.

The system {{was based on the}} fast construction of pre-fabricated <b>wooden</b> <b>moulds,</b> which would be filled with gravel and enclosed with barbed wire fencing. In average, the enclosed space formed a yard of 35 x 35 metres (1 dunam). Within this protected yard, the pre-fabricated wooden observation tower and the four sheds sheltering the initial 40 settlers were erected. The constructions were located within eyesight of neighbouring settlements and with accessibility for motor vehicles.|$|R

50|$|The chief {{building}} material was the mud-brick, formed in <b>wooden</b> <b>moulds</b> {{similar to those}} used to make adobe bricks. Bricks varied widely in size and format from small bricks that could be lifted in one hand to ones as big as large paving slabs. Rectangular and square bricks were both common. They were laid in virtually every bonding pattern imaginable and used with considerable sophistication. Drawings survive on clay tablets from later periods showing that buildings were set out on brick modules. By 3500 BC, fired bricks came into use and surviving records show a very complex division of labour into separate tasks and trades. Fired bricks and stone were used for pavement.|$|R
