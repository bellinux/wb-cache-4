So if we needed a spare train, we would pull one off the line and cancel it, which was why punctuality and reliability was so poor.

500|$|... "Grenade" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Smeezingtons (Mars, Phillip Lawrence, Ari Levine) with additional songwriting by Brody Brown, Claude Kelly, and Andrew Wyatt. The song was recorded at Larrabee Recording Studios and Levcon Studios in Los Angeles, California. In {{an interview with}} Idolator, Mars revealed the song's conception and inspiration, {{saying that he was}} with his friend Benny Blanco and he was playing a couple of songs to Mars, including one which lyrics were similar to the ones in [...] "Grenade". Blanco added that the band to which the song belonged was not signed, and that the CD was not released. Mars replied [...] "I can relate to that so much, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> and make it my own". Mars confessed that the song was inspired by [...] "his love for a girl who did not love him back". He admitted to be [...] "a bit of a drama queen in that song" [...] and that the track was therapeutic to him. Afterwards, Blanco contact the dude, and Mars started writing his version.|$|E
500|$|According to Colfer, Glees creators {{initially}} [...] "were {{leaning on}} [...] being overly flamboyant". However, the actor {{stated that he}} did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> approach [...] "because it's so overdone". Instead, he decided to portray the character as [...] "more internal and superior." [...] Colfer has explained that Kurt [...] "puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona," [...] but that [...] "underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point." [...] Colfer also commented, [...] "In later episodes, [...] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes." [...] In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is [...] "very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer Marc Jacobs before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode. The second-season episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] centered around Kurt's atheism, with Murphy explaining that Kurt is [...] "saying to the world, 'Prove [...] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.|$|E
50|$|Du Cann and Hammond {{had left}} Atomic Rooster due to {{disagreements}} with Vincent Crane over the increasingly bluesy, soulful {{direction in which}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> band. Consequently, compared with Atomic Rooster's more progressive leanings, Hard Stuff were based more heavily on aggressive guitar.|$|R

50|$|There {{were two}} sets of lyrics {{recorded}} by Laine. The version used as the film theme is western-themed, mentioning buzzards, fate and the ghosts of outlaws, and a later version describing the singer <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> train again {{in the hope of}} meeting a woman he had seen on it previously.|$|R
2500|$|Psychoanalysts {{today do}} not regard {{cross-dressing}} by {{itself as a}} psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life. [...] "For instance," [...] said Dr. Joseph Merlino, senior editor of Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius, [...] "...I'm a cross-dresser and I don't {{want to keep it}} confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> to my wife and I don't understand why she doesn't accept it, or I take it to my office and I don't understand why they don't accept it, then it's become a problem because it's interfering with my relationships and environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{summer of}} 2008, Grizzly Bear opened for Radiohead {{on the second}} leg of their North American tour. In Toronto, on their last date of the tour together, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood spoke of his love for Grizzly Bear, on stage, calling them his {{favorite}} band. Of the experience, Taylor has commented: “It was shocking, and kind of unbelievable. It still is unbelievable. Opening for Radiohead was a huge honor for us, as a band and as individuals. We’ve all had long-term relationships with Radiohead’s music, so we didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> opportunity for granted, and do anything less than the best we could." [...] Christopher has also commented that it [...] "was like a dream." ...|$|E

50|$|During a {{press conference}} several days afterward, Womé said about the penalty: “No one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> penalty. No one. Neither Samuel Eto'o nor our captain Rigobert Song, because they knew what could have {{happened}} if they missed. I have always had the courage and I went to the spot.” He also claimed that some Cameroon fans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> kill him.|$|R
6000|$|The {{morning of}} the' {{day he was}} at last to leave Venice, he came to say good bye. He {{did not ask for}} Mrs. Lander, when the girl {{received}} him, and he did not give himself time to lose courage before he began, [...] "Miss Clementina, I don't know whether I ought to speak to you after what I understood you to mean about Mr. Gregory." [...] He looked steadfastly at her but she did not answer, and he went on. [...] "There's just one chance in a million, though, that I didn't understand you rightly, and I've made up my mind that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> chance. May I?" [...] She tried to speak, but she could not. [...] "If I was wrong--if there was nothing between you and him--could there ever be anything between you and me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stand up {{and tell}} us what you have to say," [...] she remarked, with some sternness, to Verena, who only raised her eyes to her, silently now, with the same sweetness, and then rested them on her father. This gentleman seemed to respond to an irresistible appeal; he looked round at the company with all his teeth, and said that these {{flattering}} allusions were not so embarrassing as they might otherwise be, inasmuch as any success that he and his daughter might have had was so thoroughly impersonal: he insisted on that word. They had just heard her say, [...] "It is not me, mother," [...] and he and Mrs. Tarrant and the girl herself were all equally aware it was not she. It was some power outside--it seemed to flow through her; he couldn't pretend to say why his daughter should be called, more than any one else. But it seemed as if she was called. When he just calmed her down by laying his hand on her a few moments, it seemed to come. It so happened that in the West it had taken the form of a considerable eloquence. She had certainly spoken with great facility to cultivated and high-minded audiences. She had long followed with sympathy the movement for the liberation of her sex from every sort of bondage; it had been her principal interest even as a child (he might mention that at the age of nine she had christened her favourite doll Eliza P. Moseley, in memory of a great precursor whom they all reverenced), and now the inspiration, if he might call it so, seemed just to flow in that channel. The voice that spoke from her lips seemed to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> form. It didn't seem as if it could take any other. She let it come out just as it would--she didn't pretend to have any control. They could judge for themselves whether the whole thing was not quite unique. That was why he was willing to talk about his own child that way, before a gathering of ladies and gentlemen; it was because they took no credit--they felt it was a power outside. If Verena felt {{she was going to be}} stimulated that evening, he was pretty sure they would be interested. Only he should have to request a few moments' silence, while she listened for the voice.|$|E
50|$|Caballero {{signed a}} record {{contract}} with Reprise/Warner Bros. Records, which planned on marketing {{her as the}} Latin version of Madonna (who recorded for sister label Sire Records).

2500|$|He further commented [...] "What I did, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{the next}} level. It is a video game. People {{who are going}} to say, 'hey he fucked with the movie,' that's being ridiculous. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have fun and kind of create {{something}} on my own, while sticking to the same tone and flavor of the flick. People <b>want</b> <b>to</b> laugh when they're playing a game, and I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of that." ...|$|R
50|$|Shinkai spent 2008 in London, {{after the}} {{completion}} of 5 Centimeters per Second. He returned to Japan in 2009 to start work on his next project. He released two concept drawings for this film in December 2009 and noted that most of his works in the past decade were stories about characters who have to part ways with those they hold dear, but he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> theme further and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> deal more specifically on how to overcome that loss.|$|R

50|$|OG was loaned out to Kardemir Karabükspor on 26 August 2015. It {{was later}} {{revealed}} by the player himself, {{that he could have}} chosen to stay at Bursaspor, but he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> risk. OG played 24 games and scored four goals, before leaving the club {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5000|$|Sidharth has {{recently}} explained {{in an interview}} - [...] "(It was) Because of Fox Star Studios production as it's the same production house (as Bang Bang). They somewhere internally had the thought that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> franchise forward. But this film's different. The cast is different, directors are different, the world is different, budgets are different." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jesu's first release, the Heart Ache EP, was {{released}} in 2004 and featured Broadrick performing all of the instruments and vocals alone. It was followed four months later by the full-length Jesu LP, which featured the addition of bassist Diarmuid Dalton and drummer Ted Parsons, although not every song features both members. A spring 2005 tour of Europe, {{in support of the}} album, featured Roderic Mounir of Knut filling in for Ted Parsons on drums. Commenting on the sonic influences of the band, Broadrick said: [...] "I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> rhythm and weld it to the Godflesh sensibilities of abstract, surreal, mutated metal." ...|$|R

5000|$|MacLiam {{described}} his character as [...] "quite a charming, abrasive kind of guy, he's very ambitious, he's really {{looking to get}} ahead as quick as he can." [...] He said producers <b>wanted</b> Greg <b>to</b> be a [...] "North Side Dubliner", a more aggressive type of character who {{would not have a}} [...] "snug fit" [...] in the show. He likened the character to a [...] "iron first in a velvet glove". They also informed MacLiam that he would be played as a [...] "ladies man". The actor <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> characterisation and ensure Greg could [...] "get away" [...] with being a ladies man, who rises to challenges and show off a little, while still doing excellent medical work.|$|R

50|$|After {{becoming}} {{a free agent}} on July 1, 2010, Grebeshkov signed a two-year deal with SKA St. Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), four weeks later. He noted {{that he wanted to}} stay in the NHL and received several offers, but the offers he received were for 30% to 40% lower than his 2009-10 salary, and he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> drastic of a pay-cut.|$|E
5000|$|The band's {{style has}} been {{described}} as a mixture of [...] "modern funk, freeform jazz and punk white noise". Dray said of the band's music:"Why just like modern jazz? Why just like Boyd Rice, or Sonic Youth, or The Swans? Why not mutate the whole bloody thing and make the most godawful sound that you can. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> rock element to the extreme and make it do things that it was never theoretically designed to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1969, Kennedy {{defeated}} Louisiana Senator Russell B. Long by a 31–26 margin {{to become}} Senate Majority Whip, the youngest person to attain that position. While this further boosted his presidential image, he also appeared conflicted by {{the inevitability of}} having {{to run for the}} position; [...] "Few who knew him doubted that in one sense he very much <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> path", Time magazine reported, but [...] "he had a fatalistic, almost doomed feeling about the prospect". The reluctance was in part due to the danger; Kennedy reportedly observed, [...] "I know that I'm going to get my ass shot off one day, and I don't want to." [...] Indeed, there were a constant series of death threats made against Kennedy for {{much of the rest of}} his career.|$|R
5000|$|Hasegawa {{has been}} lauded {{in the field}} of tokusatsu writing for his {{dramatic}} shifts in tone regarding the content of scripts. A 2004 issue of Hyper Hobby has credited him as the creator of the Tokusatsu Drama craze in where the narratives are portrayed in a style similar to J-Drama rather than traditional tokusatsu stories, which were called by the editor of the magazine as [...] "shallow and unproductive" [...] by the early 90s. In many interviews, Hasegawa has stated that he feels tokusatsu heroes should be somewhat tormented and have to rise above adversity. He feels this was portrayed in a very thin sense during the 70s and 80s and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> aspect of tokusatsu and make it a main attraction, rather than the action the tokusatsu is known for.|$|R

5000|$|David Dean Shulman {{has taken}} down {{the account of}} one of the villagers, a young man named ‘Id al-Hajalin, who after {{outlining}} their difficulties, showed two documents, a receipt for taxes he paid on his land, and another, an order from the Military Authorities to demolish his home. He commented:“Why do they want to destroy my house? Where can I go? Can I go to America? I have nothing, and they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> nothing from me. Can you help me?

[...] She said, [...] "Mr. Castro, the Mexican kid has a charming passivity, and you tell me you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> away?"

50|$|This {{experiment}} {{ended when}} Iraq found {{itself with a}} new military government and withdrew from the agreement on 14 July 1958, one day before the Baghdad Pact summit in Turkey. At the summit, the situation in Iraq was discussed, {{and the members of}} the pact send a message to the United States to step in on the situation in Iraq. Turkey was more aggressive than the other members of the pact and started to discuss a military intervention. However, the US did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> risk and stopped Turkey. Then, on 31 July 1958, Turkey recognized the new government in Iraq and the tension in Turkey-Iraq relations decreased gradually.|$|E
5000|$|Raine stated {{his intent}} for the album's sound, [...] "Basically what he Rock did with Metallica on the 'black record', we talked and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> kind of approach. Let him simplify stuff. Let him take away... We always usually try add as many layers {{as we can}} to our music, and Bob said, 'Let's try to add not so many.'" [...] The goal was also to make the album's sound more akin to what the band sounded live {{and to make the}} songs easier to {{reproduce}} on stage. [...] "We'd record a song, sit back and ask, 'Why isn't this sounding like everyone is hearing it in their heads?' Bob would say 'let's simplify the drums,' or 'let's make that bass line simpler.' He was able to pull out why we didn't sound on albums like we do live." ...|$|R
5000|$|Foucan <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} {{discipline}} {{that was more}} personal to the individual than parkour and more easily adapted to suit each person's individual goals. [...] His idea {{was similar to that}} of Bruce Lee's creation of Jeet Kune Do. Foucan <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> everything <b>that</b> he had found useful and that he liked from his parkour experiences and combine it into one sport.|$|R
5000|$|The {{younger man}} then confesses that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> kill Steve {{and his wife}} and that his friend knows a guy who is in the [...] "business", but <b>that</b> he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> back <b>that</b> he paid to have them killed.
