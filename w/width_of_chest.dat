The man, who was about thirty-five years of age, was arrayed in a full war dress of a captain of the Umcityu regiment. From the circlet of otter skin on his brow rose his crest of plumes, round his middle, arms and knees hung the long fringes of black oxtails, and in one hand he bore a little dancing shield, also black in colour. The other was empty, since he might not appear before the king bearing arms. In countenance the man was handsome, and though just now they betrayed some anxiety, his eyes were genial and honest, and his mouth sensitive. In height he must have measured six foot two inches, yet he did not strike the observer as being tall, perhaps because of his <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> and the solidity of his limbs, that were in curious contrast to the delicate and almost womanish hands and feet which so often mark the Zulu of noble blood.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} {{on the growth}} of range cattle {{over a period of}} four years in a semi-arid region of South Africa. A total of 176 half-bred animals of five different breeds are included in this study. The data consist of live weights taken at bi-monthly intervals of all animals, and linear body measurements taken at bi-monthly intervals for a period of 28 months for three different age groups. Growth in weight is strictly seasonal from weaning to maturity. These seasonal fluctuations are shown to be closely allied to monthly rainfall. The bulk of the annual precipitation occurs from November to February and the period of greatest relative growth in weight lags approximately three months behind the period of heaviest precipitation. The greatest increase in body weight occurs from January to March and the periods of smallest increase or greatest loss in weight occur from July to September. Body measurements are also influenced by seasonal changes but to a lesser extent than body weight. The following measurements are least affected: height at withers, height over hips, body length, depth of chest and depth of flank. The measurements markedly influenced by season of the year are length of pelvis, width at hooks, width at thurls, width of loin and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>chest.</b> Significant differences between the sexes exist from birth, males being heavier than females. Sex differences in body measurements are not so marked, especially in the earlier age groups. When maturity is approached the steers exceed the heifers to a marked degree in all body measurements except those of the pelvic region. The breeds may be divided into two classes in respect to weight and size, Herefords and Sussex comprising one class and Aberdeen-Angus and Afrikander constituting another. The animals of the first class exceed those of the second class in weight and most body measurements. The Shorthorns occupy an intermediate position and the peculiar behaviour of this breed is discussed. The Afrikanders proved to have greater wither height and hip height than all other breeds. The relative importance of genetic and environmental factors on the growth of the animals is discussed. It is shown that the variance in height at withers in this population is approximately three-fourths genetic and one-fourth environmental in origin. In width at thurls and width at hooks more than 60 per cent of the variance is genetic. The variance in body length and live weight is accounted for equally by genetic and environmental factors. In all chest measurements the variance appear to be only slightly hereditary. It is shown that the factor of nutrition plays a very important role in the growth of range cattle under the conditions of this experiment. It is not possible to determine from this study whether permanent stunting results from inadequate nutrition but it is concluded that growth is retarded and maturity delayed.

In total 84 individuals of three model breeds (German Shepherd, Belgian Shepherd and Border Collie) were studied. For each individual dog six body measurements were taken and used to calculate the ratios of physical parameters (indices). In addition to the measuring, the jump over an obstacle was video recording for ad-hoc analysis of the jump parameters. Using the described methods was proven that the breed, individual training experience and body measurements have significant influence on jump performance, or more precisely on take-off and jump length. The impact of analyzed aspects on landing was significantly lower. Jump length is closely related to the depth/height index and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chest.</b> The worst performance was statistically identified at dogs with low value of the balance index.

50|$|This is a {{southern}} water spaniel bred to only {{adapt to the}} warmer climate of the southeastern USA. Coat length and density vary widely due to the variety of breeds {{that make up the}} recent background of this breed. Any coat type is acceptable, with some being almost curly like an American Water Spaniel to some with very straight fur like a Field Spaniel. Length is normally 1-2 inches throughout the body. A few bloodlines throw shorter, straight coats much like a Labrador Retriever. Feathering on the ears, chest, through the tuck-up and along the legs can be very little to moderate in density and length. Feathering may take on a sun-bleached golden to tawny color especially on the ears and should not be penalized. Groomed dogs should have a minimal of stripping or clipping, with slight shaping around the head and topline. Some individuals have a topknot like a Llewellin Setter. Field types are often shaved down and should not be penalized {{as long as it is}} of appropriate length to protect the skin.

40|$|Thoracic ratios (TRs) were {{measured}} segmentally (T 1 - 12) in the <b>chest</b> radiographs <b>of</b> 412 children aged 0 - 17 years attending hospital with minimal disorder or diseases (boys 193, girls 219). A new method for measuring TRs was used which calculates the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the left hemithorax, the right hemithorax {{and the total}} thorax relative to T 1 -T 12 distance. The data were analysed in 3 age groups [...] infancy, childhood and puberty, after the classification of Karlberg (1989). The findings are as follows. 1. The chest broadens from T 1 to about T 10 - 11. 2. Between infancy and childhood, relative to its length the chest narrows from above downwards {{and particularly in the}} lower chest (T 5 - 12 average diminution, boys 9. 5 %, girls 9. 8 %). In the upper chest, the narrowing is more marked in girls than boys (T 1 - 4 average diminution, boys 5. 1 %, girls 8. 2 %). 3. Between childhood and puberty, the girl's but not the boy's chest narrows further in its lower half (below T 6 average diminution 3. 3 %). At T 6 and above there is no detectable change in the relative <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chest</b> in either boys or girls. 4. The relative narrowing <b>of</b> the <b>chest</b> during growth appears to result from several mechanisms: (1) elevation of upper rib-vertebra angles (above 90 degrees); (2) drooping of lower rib-vertebra angles (below 90 degrees); and (3) linear rib growth being impaired relative to thoracic spinal growth in the lower ribcage (T 6 - 12) of girls between childhood and puberty (Grivas et al. 1991 d). 5. The hypothesis is suggested that the relative narrowing <b>of</b> the lower <b>chest</b> with increasing age reduces the rotational inertia of the thorax in gait. There is a greater need for such reduction in girls because of the greater rotational inertia generated by the mass of their larger pelves. This hypothesis provides a mechanical explanation for the proportionate change in the girl's lung in the later stages of growth (Simon et al. 1972). 6. Developmentally, the left hemithorax is ahead of the right hemithorax in childhood. 7. Thoracic asymmetry favouring the right chest is found, and more so in puberty than childhood which is connected with the larger size of the thorax and lung in the adult. 8. The evidence suggests that hemithoracic development is caudocranial; this is consistent with an adaptation of the human ribcage to control spinal rotation and counterrotation when bipedal gait was acquired in evolution. 9. In progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis, the upper chest is funnel-shaped. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The role of {{rib cage}} in the {{development}} of progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis (IIS) has not been studied previously. No report was found for rib growth in children with IIS. These findings caused us to undertake a segmental radiological study of the spine and rib-cage in children with progressive IIS. The aim of the present study is to present a new method for assessing the thoracic shape in scoliotics and in control subjects and to compare the findings between the two groups. Materials and methods In the posteroanterior (PA) spinal radiographs of 24 patients with progressive IIS, {{with a mean age of}} 4. 1 years old, the Thoracic Ratios (TRs) (segmental convex and concave TRs), the Cobb angle, the segmental vertebral rotation and vertebral tilt were measured. In 233 subjects, with a mean age of 5. 1 years old, who were used as a control group, the segmental left and right TRs and the total <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chest</b> (left plus right TRs) were measured in PA chest radiographs. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney, Spearman correlation coefficient, multiple linear regression analysis and ANOVA. Results The comparison shows that the scoliotic thorax is significantly narrower than that of the controls at all spinal levels. The upper chest in IIS is funnel-shaped and the vertebral rotation at T 4 early in management correlates significantly with the apical vertebral rotation at follow up. Conclusion The IIS thorax is narrower than that of the controls, the upper chest is funnel-shaped and there is a predictive value of vertebral rotation at the upper limit of the thoracic curve of IIS, which reflects, impaired rib control of spinal rotation possibly due to neuromuscular factors, which contribute also to the funnel-shaped chest. </p...|$|R

40|$|Although the use <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> drains {{is common}} in medicine, {{there appear to be}} wide {{variations}} in practice. A survey was therefore conducted to establish the current status <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> drain management in the Northwest region. A questionnaire targeted consultants practising in the specialties <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> medicine, general surgery, accident & emergency and cardiothoracic surgery. The questionnaire consisted of five sections encompassing aspects of the insertion, day-to-day care and removal <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> drains. With an overall response rate of 75. 3 % (110 / 146), important variations in every major aspect of the practice <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> drains were found between the specialties and to a large extent within each specialty. We have made a number of recommendations which aim to encourage good practice and reduce unnecessary complications, including the adoption of standardised protocols for inserting and managing chest drains.    Keywords: chest drains; clinical audi...|$|R

During LBBB, the patient showed significant mechanical dyssynchrony as evidenced by a two-dimensional speckle tracking radial strain of 260 ms (≥ 130 ms), defined as the time difference between anterior-septum and posterior wall. Five-month after carvedilol and candesartan administration, EF had improved to 49 % and LBBB did not occur until a heart rate of 126 bpm was attained during treadmill exercise.

In one study of 55 women younger than 40  years at diagnosis the 10  year rate <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> wall recurrence was 7.5 % compared to 1.5 % for older women (p =  0.003). Overall, published studies report 10  year rates <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> wall recurrence ranging from 0 to 7.5 % at 5 – 10  years among younger women with DCIS treated by mastectomy (Carlson et al. 2007; Owen et al. 2013; Chan et al. 2011; Childs et al. 2013). Our population cohort included 248 women age < 45  years at diagnosis; the 10 -year rate <b>of</b> <b>chest</b> wall recurrence was 2.7 % similar to the rate of 3 % for those 45 – 50  years and 2.4 % for women older than 50  years (p =  0.20).
