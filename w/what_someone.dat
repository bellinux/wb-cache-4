Some of the texts give considerable detail on diet, tools owned, number of livestock, and even the size of house a person of a given status had. Modern scholars have generally assumed such details rarely match exactly <b>what</b> <b>someone</b> of a given rank had. In addition, Críth Gablach contains the fee a client paid to a lord, according to rank from the lowest free man through the noble ranks, even though no noble would be another's client.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Chinese poetry does not correspond precisely with the conventional dating of Chinese history by dynasty, despite certain correspondences between {{the political and}} poetic trends, with the period of actual transition between dynasties is especially problematic. This is indeed the case in discussing the important poets in the late Han and early Six Dynasties period, including the famous general Cao Cao (155-220), who may be reckoned in this period, although actually beginning {{his career in the}} Later/Eastern Han era. That is, the final years at the End of the Han Dynasty and during which the Cao family was rising, or risen, to prominence were known as the Jian'an era (196-220). The Jian'an was technically a Han dynasty Chinese era name referring approximately to the years 196–220, during the nominal reign of Emperor Xian of Han, during the End of the Han dynasty. The following major period is known as the Three Kingdoms era, due to the three kingdoms which succeeded the Han Dynasty, and proceeded to vie with one another for succession to the Han empire. These 3 successor states are Wei (also known as Cao Wei, 220–265), Shu, (also known as Shu Han, 221–263) and Wu (also known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, 229–280). The jian'an poetry merges with early the early Six Dynasty poetry of the early Three Kingdoms, both in terms of style and in some cases the actual poets, although the plague epidemic of 217-218 killed 4 of the 7 Masters of Jian'an, and mortality rates were high otherwise, in some cases risk being associated with <b>what</b> <b>someone</b> wrote.|$|E

We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again.

It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E

After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have."

500|$|Lindstrom {{explained}} that they integrated the elements of climbing, shooting and puzzle solving. This instalment also features a new melee combat system, requiring Lara in some instances to use [...] "direct combat and evasive manoeuvres to distance herself from her attacker". Notably, Lara's bike, among other things, is a key component in solving the puzzles she will encounter in her adventure. Pick-ups have multiple uses as weapons and tools in interaction with the environment, and Lindstrom stated that Lara [...] "can also split up her guns and fire at two different targets simultaneously," [...] or hold an item {{with one hand and}} fire a gun with the other. The grappling hook can be stretched taut and used to pull objects off ledges, illustrating what project lead Rob Pavey said, that [...] "Lara {{will be able to do}} anything that you'd expect her to be able to do," [...] which he called [...] "the big theme this year." [...] Lindstrom describes this as [...] "a philosophy called 'What Could Lara Do?'—WCLD. It's short-hand for having the player be able to use their own intuition about <b>what</b> <b>someone</b> with her abilities should be able to do in an environment such as this, and consistency across the different mechanics and abilities. If she can throw a grenade, then if she can pick up this pole, why can't she throw it?" [...] Crystal Dynamics also made the game non-linear, offering elaborate multi-stage puzzles.|$|E
500|$|Growing up {{a fan of}} Disney films, Murphy {{had never}} wanted to play a princess, preferring {{characters}} who were adventurous and [...] "drove the action" [...] instead. In the actress' opinion, villains {{continue to be the}} most dynamic characters in Disney films. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney villain as a [...] "juicy" [...] experience, Murphy explained that this is because these characters are [...] "not bound by ethics or moral codes or concern for <b>what</b> <b>someone</b> thinks or how it might hurt someone else", providing actors with more freedom. Upon her first session, Murphy appreciated the directors for exposing her to early concepts and ideas about Gothel. However, Murphy was not provided with a complete script because [...] "They’re very protective about that." [...] Murphy was directed to lower the pitch of her voice in favor of demonstrating a rather [...] "flat" [...] sound. Although Murphy did not base her own performance on any one individual in particular, she admitted to Babble that she was somewhat inspired by Betty Lou Gerson's performance as Cruella de Vil in Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Comparing voice acting to Broadway, Murphy commented that, in animation, [...] "You’re recording and you’re discovering it and giving the performance all at the same time. It’s not like you have three weeks rehearsal." [...] Additionally, Murphy never worked with co-star Mandy Moore, voice of Rapunzel; instead, Murphy revealed that scenes with Gothel and Rapunzel were actually recorded opposite one of the directors impersonating Moore, who also explained to Murphy that Gothel's design will continue to evolve as the character begins to adapt the actress' mannerisms. Howard enthused that Murphy [...] "nailed" [...] Gothel, admitting to ultimately using 90% of the actress' original material and takes because [...] "The character just came right to life when she came in." ...|$|E

The a cappella version of [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] was sent to Tainy and Keko Musik for production, allowing Queen to pick the version she preferred.

In contrast, Haggard believes that [...] "We feel we choose, but we don't". Researcher John-Dylan Haynes adds [...] "How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?".

Hay decided to found a Faerie circle in Los Angeles that met at their house, which became known as [...] "Faerie Central", devoting half their time to serious discussion {{and the other half}} to recreation, in particular English circle dancing. As more joined the circle, they began meeting in West Hollywood's First Presbyterian Church and then the olive grove atop the hill at Barnsdall Park; however they found it difficult to gain the same change of consciousness that had been present at the rural gathering. The group began to discuss what the Faerie movement was developing into; Hay encouraged them to embark on political activism, using Marxism and his Subject-SUBJECT consciousness theory as a framework for bringing about societal change. Others however wanted the movement to focus on spirituality and exploring the psyche, lambasting politics as part of [...] "the straight world". Another issue of contention was over what constituted a [...] "Faery"; Hay had an idealized image of <b>what</b> <b>someone</b> with [...] "gay consciousness" [...] thought and acted like, and turned away some prospective members of the Circle because he disagreed with their views. One prospective member, the gay theatre director John Callaghan, joined the circle in February 1980, but was soon ejected by Hay after he voiced concern about hostility toward heterosexuals among the group.|$|E
