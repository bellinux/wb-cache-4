500|$|Waters {{especially}} {{appreciated the}} way Davies interpreted Kitty's ambivalence {{about being in}} love with Nan. He wrote the line for her, [...] "I hate the way you make me feel", which according to Waters crystallises Kitty's complicated emotions well. The music in the adaptation was written for the film. Waters wrote song titles but not lyrics in the music references in the novel. For one song, during Kitty and Nan's first performance in the adaptation, Davies wrote a composition that had Kitty show Nan—dressed and performing as brothers—how to pick up girls in the park. It involved Kitty teaching Nan how to kiss, which they do onstage in front of audiences <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> women, dressed as men, who are in reality {{having an affair with}} each other beyond the view of the audience. Waters wrote a similar description as Nan compares their act to their relationship; their sexual encounters to their performance onstage, noting the irony that Kitty insisted on absolute secrecy yet there they performed in front of thousands: [...] "You are too slow—you go too fast—not there, but here—that's good—that's better! It was as if we walked before the crimson curtain, lay down upon the boards and kissed and fondled—and were clapped, and cheered, and paid for it!" ...|$|E

500|$|Crystal Bell of MTV {{wrote that}} the ballad [...] "gives Ariel a purpose, reveals her deepest desire — to be where the people are — and shows us {{a glimpse of her}} strengths, vulnerabilities, and {{individual}} quirks", while establishing Ariel as an outsider. Writing for The Atlantic, Akash Nikolas agreed that as the film's [...] "I Want" [...] song, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] follows Disney's trend of establishing the main character as an outcast [...] "set apart from society by some innate desire" [...] as Ariel literally longs to be belong to a different world. Film critic Theresa Basile identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song that belongs to an adventurer who wants to explore new environments. Zaron Burnett III, writing for Thought Catalog, described the selection as a ballad in which [...] "a curious young woman ... who doesn’t fully understand the world she longs to be a part of, bravely dreams of how she can move into a new world, and reject the limitations of her father’s world (read: patriarchy)", identifying Ariel as [...] "a young feminist." [...] Meanwhile, the New York Daily News film critic Kathleen Carroll identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a [...] "typically plaintive solo" [...] that helps establish Ariel as a Broadway ingenue. Distinguished from earlier [...] "wish songs" [...] that discuss searching for [...] "happiness in everyday life", [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is about longing to abandon normalcy in favor of seeking happiness elsewhere. Comparing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] from Cinderella, Entertainment Weekly writer Esther Zuckerman observed that the song proves how different Ariel is from Disney princesses by whom she was preceded. While Cinderella's [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] is a passive song performed in third person, Ariel's number [...] "is brimming with agency" [...] to demonstrate the character's thirst for knowledge. Zuckerman credits Ashman's lyrics with providing Ariel with a personality, something she believes Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959) lacked, while giving Ariel a motive that is not romance-oriented. Additionally, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is delivered directly to the camera as opposed to an audience of woodland animals; Ariel appears as though she is speaking directly to young girls <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> the scene.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2006, Joseph Nocera, a {{business}} columnist at The New York Times, opined that the [...] "people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> Mad Money and following Cramer's advice are fools." [...] In late January 2007, Henry Blodget – himself indicted for civil securities fraud in 2002 and banned for {{life from the}} securities industry – criticized Cramer for overstating his abilities as a market forecaster, noting that in 2006 Cramer's suggested portfolio lost money [...] "despite nearly every major equity market on earth being up between about 15% and 30%". In August 2007, Cramer called for the Federal Reserve to support hedge funds that were losing money in the subprime mortgage crisis, prompting Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator for the Financial Times, to accuse Cramer of advocating an offensive and catastrophic [...] "socialism for capitalists". In March 2009, Cramer and CNBC were criticized by Jon Stewart of Comedy Central's The Daily Show.

2500|$|Article 42 {{states that}} the anthem may only be used during the {{following}} occasions: solemn acts of official, civic, cultural, scholastic or sport character. [...] The anthem can also be played to render honors to the Mexican flag and to the President of Mexico. If the national anthem {{is being used to}} honor the national flag or the President, the short version of the anthem is played. Article 43 says that special musical honors may be paid to the President and the flag, but no more than once during the same ceremony. Article 44 says that during solemn occasions, if a choir is singing the anthem, the military bands will keep silent. Article 45 says that those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> the national anthem performance must stand at attention (firmes) and remove any headgear. Article 46 {{states that the}} national anthem must be taught to children who are attending primary or secondary school; this article was amended in 2005 to add pre-school to the list. The article also states that each school in the National Education System (...) will be asked to sing the national anthem each year. Article 47 states that in an official ceremony in which is need to play another anthem, the Mexican anthem will be played first, then the guest's anthem. Article 48 states that at embassies and consulates of Mexico, the national anthem is played at ceremonies of a solemn nature that involves the Mexican people. [...] If the anthem is played outside of Mexico, Article 48 requires that the Secretary of External Relations (...) , through proper channels, must grant permission for the national anthem to be played and will also ensure that the anthem is not sung for commercial purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southeast}} panel {{illustrates the}} opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed {{and is being}} handed a bundle of spears. This {{is part of an}} initial activity before the game itself starts. Overlooking this scene is the death deity who rises from a vat of liquid, perhaps pulque. The glyphs above the deity identify it with the planet Venus. [...] Next is the southwest panel in which a different ceremonial preparation is depicted. The principal participant is supine on a kind of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame. Two participants are standing {{in the center of the}} court with speech scrolls emerging from their mouths. One holds a large knife in his left hand and gestures with his right. Between them are intertwined slashes, the symbol of the ballgame and a ball. At their waists are the protective and ritual accoutrements which are very similar to the stone yokes, palmas and hachas common in elite burials. Behind the players are two figures, one with a deer head, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> from the court walls as well as the death deity again above. The northeast panel indicates that the game has been played and one of the participants is about to be sacrificed by having his head cut off. The three figures are all dressed in the garments and symbols of the ballgame. The center figure has his arms held back by the one on the left. The figure on the right holds a large knife which is at the center figure’s neck. [...] There are scrolls indicating speech from the sacrifice as well as a depiction of the skeletal god.|$|E

2500|$|Six {{scenes from}} the life of Jesus {{continue}} on the Feasts tier to the right from the central axis of the iconostasis. These icons are the most eventful paintings of the whole icon screen. The first image, following the chronology, is the Nativity of Jesus, celebrated {{on the first day of}} Christmas, on [...] December 25. In the center of the painting the infant Jesus is resting in a manger. He holds a blue orb in his right hand. Joseph and Mary are standing behind the baby. There are seven shepherds around the manger, each of them coming to express their veneration for the divine baby. Three angels praise the infant Redeemer on the top of the icon. The next image depicts the baptism of Christ, celebrated on January 6 as Epiphany. Jesus is standing in the River Jordan in front of John the Baptist. John pours water upon Christ's head from a shell, while he prays to his Father. The Holy Spirit as a white dove appears in the background of the painting, above three ladies <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> the baptism. The third icon illustrates the transfiguration of Jesus, celebrated on August 6. Christ is metamorphosed and becomes radiant upon a mountain in front of three of his disciples: Peter, James and John. On the icon Moses appears on Jesus' right, while Elijah is on his left. The three frightened apostles are lying in front of them. The next icon shows the entry into Jerusalem, which is celebrated on Palm Sunday, a week before Easter Sunday. Jesus arrives in Jerusalem on a donkey, which symbolizes his coming in peace rather than as a triumphal king arriving on a horse. The crowd scatters flowers in front of Christ. The next icon is the Ascension of Christ, which also appears on the central axis of the iconostasis between the third and fourth tiers. The last painting on the tier depicts the descent of the Holy Spirit, the feast of Pentecost. The Holy Spirit is rendered as a white dove on the icon, and flames appear above each apostle to encourage them. Mary is in the center of the composition, surrounded by 11 apostles - Judas is not present.|$|E
