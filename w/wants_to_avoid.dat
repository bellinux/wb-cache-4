5|$|A {{few other}} {{lines have been}} tried, with the outcome varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E

25|$|After Rabbi Amar's {{ruled in}} 2005 that the Bnei Menashe would be {{accepted}} as a lost tribe and Jews after completing conversion, the plan was for Bnei Menashe to undergo conversion while living in India, at which time they would be qualified for aliyah. In September 2005, a task force from the Chief Rabbinate's Beit Din (rabbinic court) traveled to India to complete the conversion {{of a group of}} 218 Bnei Menashe. India expressed strong concern to Israel about the mass conversions, saying its laws prohibit such interference by members of another nation. It <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> proselytizing by outside groups and religious conflicts in its diverse society. In November 2005, the Israeli government withdrew the rabbinic court team from India because of the strained relations.|$|E
500|$|The International Raëlian Movement envisions {{having an}} {{entrance}} with an aseptic chamber {{leading to a}} conference room for twenty-one {{people as well as}} a dining room of the same capacity. [...] In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy. [...] The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be {{in the center of a}} large park and protected from trespassing by a wall—a maximum of two stories—to surround the entire complex's circumference. [...] Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area. [...] The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance. [...] The landing pad for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4" [...] on its terrace. [...] The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only. [...] The seven rooms directly underneath the landing pad would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick metal door. [...] Finally, the International Raëlian Movement <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy. [...] Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems are part of this vision. A nearby replica of the Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials open to the public is expected to show visitors what it is like inside the real one.|$|E
500|$|Music critics met {{the record}} with mixed reviews. German radio station [...] praised the [...] "harmonious and compatible" [...] way Inna's songs fit {{together}} on the record. They also commended the [...] "incredibly danceable and upbeat disco sound" [...] and found that she remained true to her style. Especial praise was reserved for [...] "Endless", as the station found the song distinguished itself from the other material on I Am the Club Rocker. However, Kai Butterweck, a writer for online German magazine Laut, gave I Am the Club Rocker a negative review, commenting that [...] "the scheme is the same in nearly all the songs: galloping offbeat-keyboards first meet with innovation loose beats, ere Inna's thin vocal organ moves the next three or four minutes on almost the same pitch". He further described the songs' rhymes as being [...] "cobbled together from a sixth graders' dictionary". Anna Julia Höhr, writing for the news agency Teleschau, similarly criticized the album, saying that the singer's tunes sound [...] "all the same" [...] and evaluating the record as [...] "disappointing". AllMusic's Jon O'Brien rated I Am the Club Rocker with two-and-a-half out of five stars, describing its songs as [...] "sun-soaked Europop tracks that appear destined to blare out of various Club 18-30 hotspots until the inevitable 6-a.m. stagger back to the hotel". He also criticized the use of Auto-Tune throughout the record and noticed major similarities between the album track [...] "Moon Girl" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "California Gurls" [...] (2010). O'Brien went on say that Inna [...] "is {{going to have to}} change the record quickly if she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the novelty-act fate of her homeland's formerly most famous pop export", asserting that I Am the Club Rocker was the first Romanian major contribution to the international pop music industry after the work of girl band The Cheeky Girls.|$|E

500|$|After Robert California (James Spader) {{is forced}} to sell his mansion {{at the behest of}} his ex-wife {{following}} his divorce, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) suggests that he have an office pool party. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes his girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler) to the party and brings an engagement ring his Jessica-approving mother gave him, hoping to propose. The ring goes missing from Andy's pants and he is horrified that he cannot find it. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) later find the ring and decide, based on the superstition of finding a lost ring, that it must be destroyed. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), having been told by Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) that Andy followed her home after the Christmas party, decides to make Andy jealous by flirting with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight initially refuses, but, after realizing that Erin's choosing him as her co-conspirator is flattering to his attractiveness, agrees to help. The two flirt outrageously whenever Andy is close by, but Andy does not notice. To ensure Andy's attention, Erin and Dwight challenge Andy and Jessica to a series of chicken fights in the pool. After several defeats, Erin is so determined to win a match that she pushes Dwight {{to the point where he}} passes out in the water, ending the game. In a final attempt to make Andy jealous, Dwight tells Andy he wants to pursue a romance with Erin but <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> an [...] "Angela-type situation" [...] between them. Andy assures Dwight that he and Erin are through but, at the mention of Dwight having sex with Erin that very night, suggests that Dwight take things slowly instead, leading Dwight to pointedly tell him [...] "You're an idiot." [...] Erin later swims up to Andy with the lost ring, which Kelly had earlier set in the pool atop a tiny pyre, and he admits that he has doubts about proposing to Jessica. This makes Erin very happy.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{takes place}} [...] "in ages past, when the pantheon was still home to countless gods from all empires." [...] However, it {{is a time}} when the gods have lost their purpose; Jupiter is {{interested}} only in eating and drinking; Horus thinks of nothing except his pyramids; and Ch'ih-yu simply wants to eat livestock. The story begins with HE, the [...] "Unknown God", and creator of all gods, summoning the lesser gods to HIM, and telling them [...] "for eons, you think only of pleasure, and now even the lowliest men say, [...] "these drunks don't do anything for us. Let's go over their heads to the boss"." [...] HE is afraid this will lead to monotheism, which HE <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid,</b> as HE has neither the time nor inclination to govern all of humanity himself. As a result, HE commands each of them [...] "to pick one who is the best of your people," [...] and have him lead a war against the other two peoples.

Jupiter picks Septimus Marius, a sea merchant; Horus picks Ramadamses, a sculptor; and Ch'ih-yu picks Tsu-Tang, a rice farmer.|$|E

[...] After the crushing defeat of Austria by Prussia at the Battle of Sadowa, Thiers declared, [...] "It was France which was defeated at Sadowa."
