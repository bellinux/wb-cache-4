40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose that the rise in {{underemployment}} has changed the wage setting process in the labour market and is now used by employers {{as a means of}} disciplining <b>wages</b> <b>growth.</b> We use the Australian labour market as the empirical example. Our further work will focus on other economies. The paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 traces the rise in underemployment in Australia to the dynamics that accompanied the 1991 recession. Firms rapidly replaced full-time jobs with fractional opportunities. Section 3 considers wage and productivity movements in Australia and finds that over the recent <b>growth</b> cycle, real <b>wages</b> have trailed behind labour productivity and hence there has been a massive redistribution of national income to profit. Further, the relation between the employment rate and real <b>wages</b> <b>growth</b> has changed dramatically over the last growth period. Compared to earlier periods, rising employment rates have very little impact on real <b>wages</b> <b>growth.</b> Section 4 develops a theoretical model grounded in labour market segmentation theory to explain these trends. Section 5 provides formal econometric evidence to support the proposition that underemployment is a significant negative influence on inflation. Concluding remarks follow...|$|R

The analysis covers a crucial decade in the working lives of a cohort of young men - the years {{from the age of}} 23 to the age of 33. We use hurdle negative binominal models to estimate the number of work-related training events. This approach, which has not been used for training before, allows us to account for the fact that more than 50 % of sample members experienced no work-related training over the period 1981 to 1991. We find evidence of strong complementaries between past general education and training, suggesting that reliance on job-related training to increase the skills of the British workforce will result in an increase in the skills of the already-educated, but will not improve the skills of individuals entering the labor market with a low level of education. The results generated from the hurdle count model are subsequently used in estimation of the <b>wages</b> <b>growth</b> model. We find that each additional training event is estimated to increase <b>wages</b> <b>growth</b> by 0. 7 per cent, for young men experiencing at least one training occurrence over the decade...|$|R
