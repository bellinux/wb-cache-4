500|$|Tom Robinson is {{the chief}} example among several innocents {{destroyed}} carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: [...] "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does {{in the beginning of}} the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished." [...] The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, [...] "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things... Atticus, he was real nice," [...] to which he responds, [...] "Most people are, Scout, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> see them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the draft, Quinn {{was criticized}} by fellow Notre Dame quarterback Joe Theismann {{in a radio}} interview, {{claiming}} that Quinn looked [...] "unprofessional" [...] {{when he was on}} stage following his name being called. Theismann was bothered by the appearance of Quinn's hair {{and the fact that he}} was chewing gum. Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and everything looked good.

2500|$|Indiana players wear {{warm-up pants}} that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first {{worn by the}} team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At {{the time they were}} in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, but despite {{changing}} styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, [...] "As you watch television and you watch the IU games, that's the first thing you saw, was the team run out in the candy stripes. So <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> got to put those on, those are pretty special." [...] Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events. Beginning in 2014, during Hoosier Hysteria, former IU basketball players have presented to the new players their first pair of candy striped pants. This practice symbolizes a [...] "passing-of-the-torch" [...] and carrying on the rich tradition and responsibilities of playing for Indiana University.|$|E

It was ranked as the 26th top game of all time by Next Generation in 1996 ("breathed new live into turn-based strategy genre"), the 35th best video game of all time by GameSpy in 2001 ("stellar game design can withstand the test of time"), as the second best video game since 1992 by Finnish magazine Pelit in 2007, and as the 78th best video game [...] "to play today" [...] by Edge in 2009. Polish web portal Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 13th best Amiga game, {{as well as the}} third most addictive game [...] "that stole our childhood"; it was also retrospectively ranked as the eight best Amiga game by the Polish edition of CHIP.

2500|$|Cage's fight {{style in}} the series was called [...] "smack-fu" [...] by Coker, {{referring}} {{to the way he}} tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength. To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices had the ability to [...] "burn the skin if not attached properly to clothing, and [...] once almost lost hearing in one ear when he forgot to insert the required ear pieces." [...] The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional Crispus Attucks complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene shown in full later in the episode, on which Coker said, [...] "You're already anticipating what's going to happen, so <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> do get to that moment and then the music kicks in, it takes on this new energy." [...] The fight itself is the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in Daredevil, with Coker explaining, [...] "We wanted to do something that, while in the same realm, was its own thing ... That's what this whole show is about, ultimately, being able to do the superhero thing with flavor." [...] Filming for the fight was influenced by [...] "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s invading the police station in Terminator", {{and was one of the}} toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director Guillermo Navarro. Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, [...] "a geek bar none" [...] who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashback sequences with Colter in makeup and different costumes, and each scene was shot by director Vincenzo Natali in many camera setups.|$|E

6000|$|He {{remained}} as ever, {{a fixture in}} my chamber. Nay--if that were possible--he became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be done? He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there? In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a necklace, but afflictive to bear. Yet I was sorry for him. I speak less than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness. If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At length, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days' time he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but {{take the first step}} towards a removal. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> quit me, Bartleby," [...] added I, [...] "I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour, remember." ...|$|E

Well, keep it all up, and above all keep up that same blest confidence in my fond appreciation. Wonderful your account of that night visit to the trenches and giving me more of the sense and the smell and the fantastic grimness, the general ordered and methodised horror, than anything else whatever that has pretended to enlighten us. With infinite interest do I take in what you say of the rapidity with which the inside-out-ness of your conditions becomes the matter of course and the platitudinous--which I take partly to result from the tremendous collectivity of the case, doesn't it? the fact of the wholeness of the stress and strain or intimate fusion, as in a common pot, of all exposures, all resistances, all the queerness and all the muchness! But I mustn't seem to put too interrogatively my poor groping speculations. Only wait to correct my mistakes in some better future, and I shall understand you down to the ground. We add day to day here as consciously, or labouringly, as you are doing, no doubt, on your side--it's in fact like lifting every 24 hours, just now, a very dismally dead weight and setting it on top of a pile of such others, already stacked, which promises endlessly to grow--so that the mere reaching up adds all the while to the beastly effort. London is grey--in moral tone; and even the Zeppelin bombs of last night at Yarmouth do little to make it flush. What a pitiful horror indeed must that Ypres desolation and desecration be--a baseness of demonism. I find, thank God, that under your image of that I at least can flush.
