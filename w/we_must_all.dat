On Victory Day in Port Said, Nasser conceded that [...] "We are facing difficulties. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>all</b> work harder [...] and make sacrifices. I have no magic button that I can push to produce the things you want". Premier Zakaria Mohieddin raised Egypt's income tax, added a [...] "defense tax" [...] on all sales, and boosted tariffs on nonessential imports.

Egyptian-supported groups executed sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

And the question <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>all</b> answer is, {{what are we going to}} do about it?" [...] Bloomberg also talked about how he would go about fighting climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, using cleaner and more efficient fuels, and encouraging public transportation.
