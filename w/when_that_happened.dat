5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and {{she found herself in}} the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Elliott and Ian Thomas {{started the}} reply {{well for the}} hosts Glamorgan, putting on 40 for the first wicket before Thomas departed, but the Gloucestershire seamers Jon Lewis and Alex Gidman shared out wickets to reduce Glamorgan to 48 for 4. Double-digit {{contributions}} from the lower order, led by wicketkeeper Mark Wallace, who made a half-century, lifted Glamorgan {{to a total of}} 239 - still 237 behind Wallace. Following on, Glamorgan batted for nearly 25 overs before losing their first wicket - Ian Thomas - and stumps were drawn <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> leaving Glamorgan on 93 for 1.|$|E
25|$|Maria is {{described}} as a success in her social role as Empress, loved to dance at the balls of high society and became a popular socialite and hostess of the Imperial balls; her daughter Olga commented, “Court life had to run in splendor, and there my mother played her part without a single false step.”, and a contemporary remarked on her success: “of the long gallery of Tsarinas who have sat in state in the Kremlin or paced in the Winter Palace, Marie Feodorovna was perhaps the most brilliant”. She longed for the balls and gatherings in the Winter Palace. These also occurred at Gatchina. Alexander used to enjoy joining in with the musicians, although he would end up sending them off one by one. <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> Maria knew the party was over.|$|E

25|$|The chase {{was never}} really on for Bangladesh, who kept their run rate {{steadily}} above 4 an over but had to see the required rate explode to nearly nine an over. <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in the 28th over, and the score was at 121 for 2, the Bangladeshis tried to hit out, and duly lost three wickets to Dilshan's off spin. Shahriar Nafees was first to fall to Dilshan's spin, having made his second ODI fifty in six games, while Rafique and Ashraful followed shortly afterwards. Forced onto the back foot with the score 140 for 5, Bangladesh put on substitute Tushar Imran, who joined in a partnership of 71 with Bashar in 13 overs. However, the pair scored too slowly to have any chance of winning, instead just trying to save face. Sri Lanka saved their pace bowlers again, opting for Dilshan, Upul Chandana and even the medium pace of Mahela Jayawardene, as they used eight of their eleven possible bowlers in the innings.|$|E
25|$|FitzGerald's {{government}} {{lasted until}} January 1982 when it collapsed {{due to a}} controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having {{a majority in the}} Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately. Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.|$|E

To unlock the chest, the team captain must input the three-color combination code that Newton calls out before pressing the button. If it's locked, a buzzer will sound, signaling a wrong combination. <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens,</b> <b>that</b> team will go back into the studio audience. If it opens however, then a fanfare will play and cash will come out from the chest, which signals a winning combination. <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens,</b> <b>that</b> team will move on to the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine for a chance to win more money and a brand-new car.|$|R

500|$|In February 1991, in an interview, Jon Vitti {{described}} [...] "Bart the Genius" [...] as {{his favorite}} among the episodes {{he wrote to}} that point. James L. Brooks also mentioned the episode among his favorites, saying that [...] "we did things with animation <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> that just opened doors for us." [...] The show received mail from viewers complaining that the throwing away of a comic book was an incident of censorship.

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh.

2500|$|Since {{its initial}} appearance, many coaches have become {{reluctant}} to use the strategy amid those criticisms of it, as well as doubts about its ultimate effectiveness in minimizing scoring. One contributing factor to those doubts is that players sometimes show a penchant for making {{a greater percentage of}} his free throws when the Hack-a-Shaq strategy is being employed against them than they do on the whole. [...] Some have theorized that sending O'Neal to the foul line repeatedly over a short period of time, as the Hack-a-Shaq strategy did, ran the risk of allowing him to [...] "get into a rhythm" [...] in shooting his free throws. <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> then the strategy would negate itself by inadvertently transforming O'Neal (temporarily) into a better free throw shooter.|$|E

Currently, it is legal to give birth at home in Alabama, but that birth cannot be attended by anyone, including midwives. Proponents of midwives have been trying to introduce a bill to change the law for the past nine years when it was finally made it out of committee in 2011.
