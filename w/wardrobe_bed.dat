40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explain the process of knowledge acquisition utilising the method for the decomposition of the components of a system to extract design rules. The furnished drawing of a dwelling is considered as the language of a designer. These drawings contain the semantic knowledge that can be called general architectural know-how. This paper bases on the decomposition of the syntax of a room image. The syntax of a room image consists of walls, windows, circulation zones and furniture such as <b>beds,</b> <b>wardrobes,</b> commodes, dressing tables, etc. The syntax of a room image has some linkages. The designer put the syntax together with the joints of circulation zones as a grammar to match. The existing relations between the objects in a design can be called grammar. An experiment is applied to three classes of a CAAD course organised by the Turkish Chamber of Architects. The living room is given already furnished in the experiment and the rest of a dwelling is expected to be furnished. In the first phase, the experiment is applied on two different classes in different times. It is interesting that the same grammar is used by 6 of 8 couple of designers for 3 different types (A, B and D) of bedrooms. Only one of the bedrooms of C type) has different design styles in spite of looking much like each other. In the second phase, for the third class of 6 groups, plan is modified slightly. In this case all of the 6 couples of designers use the same grammar for 2 alternatives of D type bedroom for parents. An original method is applied in the elicitation of the knowledge in this experiment. The properties of the objects and their links are represented by a semantic network graph. This paper also presents the grammar of the furnished rooms and shows the density of preferences. Design rules are extracted from these drawings of a furnished dwelling by searching for similarities in the plans designed by different designers. The designers have some specifications about the grammar of furnishing and an image schema of the proposed room in their minds, depending on their education and experiences. During the design of a room, designers look for differences and the similarities existing in the syntax of the proposed room image and the image of furnished room on the screen. If these images match with each other, the designers satisfy with the result This paper investigates the image schemata of the designers by evaluating their drawings. Some design rules are represented by means of image schemata. Matching the joints of circulation zones, the designers put the syntax of different image schemata together and they can illustrate different alternatives, restricted by the translation of these image schemata...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo geral realizar uma avaliação ergonômica de móveis residenciais para subsidiar a definição de critérios de conformidade para o pólo moveleiro de Ubá MG. O {{material}} utilizado foi proveniente de 50 indústrias de móveis, associadas ao INTERSIND. Ao todo, foram avaliados 107 móveis montados, sendo 31 guarda-roupas, 21 camas, 15 cadeiras, 14 mesas de jantar e 26 estofados. Os critérios de conformidade ergonômica foram avaliados para cada linha de móvel fabricado, de acordo com os princípios ergonômicos de antropometria e com base em aspectos de segurança para o usuário. Foram realizadas entrevistas com proprietários de lojas que comercializam móveis provenientes das fábricas associadas ao INTERSIND, com o objetivo de destacar as vantagens e desvantagens dos móveis adquiridos. Foi realizada, ainda, uma pesquisa com responsáveis por projetos de móveis, com o objetivo de identificar os critérios adotados por eles na determinação das dimensões do mobiliário que projetam. Os principais resultados deste trabalho mostraram que a cama é o principal tipo de móvel fabricado, com predominância dos padrões mogno e marfim; o aglomerado seguido do MDF, são os materiais mais utilizados na fabricação dos móveis no pólo moveleiro de Ubá. O uso de tecidos claros em revestimentos de sofás e cadeiras também se mostrou predominante. Os sofás analisados apresentaram conformidade com as recomendações da NBR 15164 / 2004, quanto à altura de encosto, à largura e a profundidade útil de assento; no entanto, quanto à altura do assento, todos os sofás estavam em não conformidade com esta norma, uma vez que apresentaram valores superiores à máxima recomendada. Embora a maioria das camas não atendesse à recomendação da ABIMÓVEL (2003), quanto à altura da face superior do estrado ao piso, de uma maneira geral apresentaram conformidade com as recomendações desta entidade, quanto às dimensões internas e espessura das barras laterais. A maior parte dos guarda-roupas analisados não atendeu às recomendações da ABIMÓVEL (2003), quanto à profundidade interna, vãos livres adequados para o cabideiro e o calceiro e quanto às dimensões internas das gavetas. Todos os assentos das cadeiras apresentaram alturas superiores às máximas recomendadas e aos valores relacionados com dados antropométricos, podendo ocasionar desperdício de matéria prima e problemas de ordem ergonômica nos usuários. A maioria das mesas analisadas, também, apresentou alturas superiores às recomendadas. Os resultados demonstraram que, de uma maneira geral, os aspectos ergonômicos, como conforto, adaptação antropométrica, funcionalidade e segurança, não estão sendo priorizados em projetos de mobiliário fabricados no pólo moveleiro de Ubá e região. In general, {{the acquisition}} of a furniture is made mainly in function of the visual appearance and of the durability of the product. However, a furniture that seems aesthetic pleasant, can present inadequacies to its function, that happens for not being projected {{in agreement with the}} due ergonomic patterns. To the furniture present ergonomic quality, should have norms that regulate its minimum characteristics, seeking to adapt the product to the users needs. And to evaluate if this product is in agreement with the established norms, an evaluation of the conformity is accomplished, seeking to the best quality of furniture and consequently it turns them more competitive in the market. This work had a general objective to accomplish an ergonomic evaluation of residential furniture to subsidize the definition of conformity criteria for the furniture industry of Ubá-MG. For that has been used some material originated from 50 industries of furniture associated to INTERSIND. To the whole work were appraised 107 mounted furnitures, being 31 <b>wardrobes,</b> 21 <b>beds,</b> 15 chairs, 14 dining tables and 26 sofas. The criteria of ergonomic conformity were appraised for each line of manufactured furniture, according to the ergonomic anthropometrical principles and based on aspects of safety for the user. Were also made interviews with owners of stores that sell furniture of the factories associated to INTERSIND with the objective of take the advantages and disadvantages that the furniture presents. It was still accomplished by research with people responsible to projects furniture with the objective of identify the criteria adopted by them in the determination of the dimensions of the furniture that they project. The main results of this work pointed out that the bed is the main furniture manufactured by the associated of INTERSIND. The pattern mahogany and ivory prevail in this furniture industry. The agglomerate followed by MDF is the material more used in the furniture s production in the furniture industry of Ubá. The use of woven clear to cover sofas and chairs was also shown predominant. The analyzed sofas were presented in conformity with the recommendations of NBR 15164 / 2004 in relation to the prop height, the width and the useful depth of seat. However, in relation to the seat s height, all the sofas were not in conformity with this norm, once they presented superior values to the maxim recommended. Although most of the beds didn't assist to the recommendation of ABIMÓVEL (2003) in relation to the height of the superior face of the bed frame to the floor, in a general way they were in conformity with the recommendations of this entity in relation to the internal dimensions and thickness of the lateral bars. Most of the analyzed wardrobes didn't assist the recommendations of ABIMÓVEL (2003) in relation to the depth interns, empty spaces free from the place to put shirts, pants and as the internal dimensions of drawers. All the seats of the chairs presented superior heights to the maxims recommended by authors and the ones related with anthropometrical values that had been given, could cause matter waste and problems of ergonomic order in the users. Most of the tables analyzed also presented superior heights to the recommended by authors. In this way the results demonstrated that in general, ergonomic aspects, as comfort, anthropometric adaptation, functionality and safety are not being prioritized in furniture projects manufactured in the furniture industry of Ubá and area...|$|R
