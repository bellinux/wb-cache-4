25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted {{to give them an}} ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> sure you don’t get reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|E

500|$|In 1962, {{she had a}} well-publicized {{affair with}} Enrico Bomba, the Italian {{producer}} and production manager of her film Panic Button. Hargitay accused Bomba of sabotaging their marriage. In 1963, she had another well-publicized relationship with singer Nelson Sardelli, whom she said she planned to marry when her divorce from Mickey Hargitay was finalized. The couple divorced in Juarez, Mexico, in May 1963, where Nelson Sardelli accompanied Mansfield in her legal preparations. She had previously filed for divorce on May 4, 1962, but told reporters [...] "I'm sure <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> it up." [...] During the acrimonious divorce proceedings, the actress attempted to force a more favorable financial settlement by accusing Hargitay of kidnapping one of her children.|$|E

Later, a teaser poster depicting promotional concept art for Cobra: The Space Pirate, along with a release date scheduled for mid-2013, was unveiled. In September 2013, however, Aja admitted that making the film will be [...] "very hard" [...] since [...] "to do {{a new kind of}} Star Wars, [...] expensive" [...] though he stated [...] "we are trying everything, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> it." [...] In July 2014, Aja revealed it was estimated that the project would require a budget of over $150 million, and that he was seeking to have an A-list actor to help attract a funder. One of his main difficulties, Aja said in 2015, was to decide who would star the film: [...] "When I think 'who the heck is going to play that Cobra?', I become unable to move forward." ...|$|E

500|$|Archbishop of Bangalore Archdiocese Bernard Moras {{rejected}} the Somasekhara report, stating, [...] "It {{has failed to}} address the terms of reference of the Commission and has failed {{to do justice to}} the Christian community."

Bajrang Dal State convener Suryanarayana also disputed the veracity of the Somasekhara report in its statements about the Bajrang Dal involvement and former Bajrang Dal state convener Mahendra Kumar. He issued a statement saying that [...] "Bajrang Dal had no role to play in the incidents of attacks on churches and the statement given by Mr. Kumar during the attacks in 2008 were his personal views and the organisation had clarified this aspect then. However, Uday Kumar Shetty, the president of the district unit of the BJP, approved of the report, believing that the report was correct in its assertion that the Sangh Parivar were not involved in the attacks.|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!"

500|$|Tamworth started 2009–10 in good form, and by late September 2009 were {{occupying a}} {{play-off}} {{spot in the}} Conference Premier. Mills' team eventually finished in 16th place in a season of consolidation; this represented the second highest league placing in the club's history. He made the last appearance of his career aged 48 after starting Tamworth's 4–3 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United on 24 April 2010, before substituting himself for Des Lyttle in the 55th minute. This was his third appearance of the season. In the Conference Premier, Tamworth were playing against a number of clubs with Football League pedigrees, meaning {{they were not able}} to offer contracts as lucrative or long as many clubs. Mills complemented the competitiveness of his team in this division, saying: [...] "For a small club like us, it's great to be mixing with these teams. But, while we may be smaller, like last year, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> sure that we are capable of getting results." [...] Tamworth had a strong start in 2010–11; they were again in a play-off position by late September 2010, and by the time Mills had left the club they were 12th in the Conference Premier.|$|E

500|$|When the Persians arrived off {{the coast}} of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to worry {{that they would not be}} able to defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius's wrath should they fail. The Ionian tyrants who had been {{expelled}} at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: [...] "Men of Ionia, let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others." [...] The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.|$|E
500|$|By 1993, their {{relationship}} had thawed again, and Simon invited Garfunkel {{on an international}} tour with him. Following a 21-date, sold-out run at the Paramount Theater in New York and an appearance at that year's Bridge School Benefit in California, the duo toured the Far East. The duo had a falling out {{over the course of}} the rest of the decade, the details of which have never been disclosed. Simon thanked Garfunkel at his 2001 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist: [...] "I regret the ending of our friendship. I hope that some day before we die <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> peace with each other," [...] resuming after a pause, [...] "No rush." [...] They were awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003, for which the promoters convinced them to reconcile and open the show with a performance of [...] "The Sound of Silence." [...] The performance was satisfying for both musicians, and they planned out a full-scale reunion tour over the summer. The Old Friends tour began in October 2003 and played to sold-out audiences across the United States for 30 dates until mid-December. The tour earned an estimated $123 million. Following a twelve-city run in Europe in 2004, they ended their nine-month tour with a free concert along Via dei Fori Imperiali, in front of the Colosseum in Rome. It attracted 600,000 fans, even more than their The Concert in Central Park. In 2005, Simon and Garfunkel performed three songs for a Hurrican Katrina benefit concert in Madison Square Garden. The duo performed Mrs. Robinson, and Homeward Bound. Bridge Over Troubled Water was then performed by the duo with singer Aaron Neville.|$|E
