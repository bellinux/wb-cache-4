5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> witness on charters. While it {{is often}} {{difficult}} to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement near the top of the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E

The building had been vacant since the early 1970s and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> target of vandalism; the fire was judged to be of suspicious origin.

5|$|Although Alexander <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> {{witness to}} royal {{charters}} and documents, {{there is no}} evidence that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} chimpanzee, known for being the {{one-time}} companion animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. The animal <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E

A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E
5|$|Goodridge {{gave the}} {{portrait}} to statesman Daniel Webster, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> subject {{and possibly a}} lover, {{following the death of}} his wife; she may have intended to provoke him into marrying her. Although Webster married someone else, his family held onto the portrait until the 1980s, when it was auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Gloria and Richard Manney in 1981. The couple donated or sold the miniatures of their art collection, including Beauty Revealed, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other}} country in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states. President Zine El Abidine visited the Clinton White House in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York {{public schools in}} 1921. The ACLU, working with the NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not {{make an effort to}} defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, right to privacy, or wiretapping.|$|E
5|$|Leopold's {{priority}} was to rest his leg. Wolfgang passed {{the time by}} composing a short minuet, K.122/73t, and a Miserere in A minor, K.85/73s. Meanwhile, the libretto for the Milan opera arrived; Leopold had been expecting Metastasio's La Nitteti, but it was Mitridate, re di Ponto, by Vittorio Cigna-Santi. According to the correspondence of Leopold, the composer Josef Mysliveček <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> visitor to the Mozart household while they were staying in Bologna. The musicologist Daniel E. Freeman believes that Mozart's approach to the composition of arias changed fundamentally at this time, bringing his style into closer alignment with that of Mysliveček.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy {{established}} {{a bond with}} the powerful Kennedy family, which had high visibility among Catholics. McCarthy became {{a close friend of}} Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., himself a fervent anti-Communist, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port. He dated two of Kennedy's daughters, Patricia and Eunice. It has been stated that McCarthy was godfather to Robert F. Kennedy's first child, Kathleen Kennedy. This claim has been acknowledged by Robert's wife and Kathleen's mother Ethel, though Kathleen later claimed that she looked at her christening certificate and that her actual godfather was Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart professor Daniel Walsh.|$|E

5|$|Peveril of the Peak (1823) by Sir Walter Scott is a {{historical}} novel set at Peveril Castle, Castleton {{during the reign of}} Charles II. William Wordsworth <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>frequent</b> visitor to Matlock; the Peak inspired several of his poems, including an 1830 sonnet to Chatsworth House. The village of Morton in Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel Jane Eyre is based on Hathersage, where Brontë stayed in 1845, and Thornfield Hall might have been inspired by nearby North Lees Hall. Snowfield in George Eliot's first novel Adam Bede (1859) is believed to be based on Wirksworth, where her uncle managed a mill; Ellastone (as Hayslope) and Ashbourne (as Oakbourne) are also featured.|$|E

Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E
