40|$|In Chapter 1 ，I {{introduce}} the viewpoint {{and the purpose}} of this study. This is a study of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system which is really the substance of labor management in modern enterprise. In this paper. <b>Wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is taken up as the central problem domain from the viewpoint of business management. And then this study' s purpose is to consider that <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system based on the seniority-oriented system should be corrected for what kind of it in the times of aging of population composition, internationalization of labor movement, and the computerization in our country. Moreover. it considers about the rule by which <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary,</b> <b>and</b> the principles of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration which are not established as yet in Japanese enterprise. Chapter 2 is the preceding chapter before the main subject. The <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system which is the central problem domain of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system is surrounded by various laws, theories <b>and</b> influences on <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration. I considered the surrounding four positions. The first is the legal theory on subjects of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> (labor standard law of our country, collective agreement and office regulations of enterprise of our country). The second is the theory of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> as economic theory (the wage fund theory, the marginal productivity theory and the labor value theory). The third is the social theory of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> as the factor which should be taken into consideration in the case of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> determination (the market rate, the laborer' s living expenses level, change of prices, labor productivity, the ability of enterprise to pay) Finally，it is the business management theory of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary.</b> Although such theory and influence are not the direct requirements for the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration or <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system, it's effect is never small Therein is clarified the basic meaning of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary,</b> the positioning <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration in labor management，and the domain of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration. That is to say, the article about <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> is taken up from five laws, including the labor standard law of our country. And then，it is clarified that <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> is the compensation of labor between laborer <b>and</b> employer. <b>Wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration is positioned with one basic domain of labor management that is divided to seven domains of labor management (Employment Management, Educational Training and Capability Development Management. Working Environmental Management. <b>Wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Salary</b> Administration， Health <b>and</b> Welfare Management, Management of Human Relations，Management of lndustrial Relations). Also, the main domain of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration is divided into two <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system <b>and</b> the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary.</b> These two points are occupying the important positions in this study. In Chapter 3, I discussed the trend of the actuality in the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system in enterprise of our country. The first <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system in our country is a Den-san type wage structure, this wage structure had the deep color of living wages. Next. the seniority-oriented <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system appeared around from 1960, subsequently, job performance abilities evaluation wage rate system appear around from 1975. But the color of living <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> seniority-oriented <b>wages</b> remained in this <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system. However, in our country, aging of population composition and internationalization of labor movement progress around from 1980. It becomes increase of personnel expenses (labor cost) and it becomes the big burden of business management in enterprise. Moreover, in the times of the computerization which spreads quickly, the correspondence to change of the job contents is needed by business management in enterprise. In this way， adoption of a new <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system come to be seen in after 1990. Here, I touch the annual <b>salary</b> system <b>and</b> profit or added value sharing plan that draws public attention as new <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system. It is decided how the result (profit or added value) is shared among both based on recognition as the result of collaboration of laborer and employer (Profit Sharing Plan, Rucker Plan, Scanlon Plan, American Mortor's Plan, Kaiser Plan). The annual salary plan is the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system that is adopted as the managerial position of the company of our country on the pretext of restructuring in after 1990. This plan can say it is correction of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system from living serious-consideration wages to job serious-consideration wages. Also，this plan has the strong character of reward, <b>and</b> the <b>wage</b> rate in this plan, can be called single job rate. Therefore, it is necessary for us to give feed back on job evaluation research. By the way, the seniority-oriented system and the custom of lifelong things completely, but however, have a close relation in fact. Merely，the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system does not give any answer about the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary.</b> Therefore another principle is required. When the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary,</b> the separate principle is necessary. That is to say, the purpose of business management is the upkeep and the development of enterprise, and improvement in the laborer' s living standard. What business management should think important is two subjects of cost (labor cost) and laborer' s life (living expenses). From here, business management does not use mind only for the cost reduction, but should adopt “the laborer' s living standard" as the separate principle for the determination of the amount of money. Moreover，I {{introduce the}} principles of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration which should be thought important. In case the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> salary，it is very important. That is, conditions on the side of business management is the requirement of management. nature and objective of the organization, integration in administration. And conditions on the side of labor is satisfy the public interest, locality requirement, and reactions of the labor union. These principles are advocated by Prof. Y. Shimabukuro as basic theory of “Consensus Management". This “Consensus Management" is the important principle in that the determination of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> should be reached by consensus among both laborer and employer. These six principles of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration must be taken notice of as what functions on the “consensus" formation among business management and laborer. In addition，the incentive nature of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> <b>and</b> the dissatisfied concentration nature of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> are taken up as important matters in enforcement of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system. Chapter 6 is conclusions of what so far has been described. That is to say <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system which is main content of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system in the modern enterprises has been studied center in this paper. First, as a direction of the ecdysis by aging and internationalization from the seniority-oriented <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system, it was asserted that the correction to job evaluation wage rate system was concretely appropriate to the work(job) center <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system. Secondly， the adoption of the Paterson method (the job evaluation method) is asserted as the correspondence to change of the job contents by the computerization. Thirdly, when the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> payment system is combined with actual amount of money, the principle to be emphasized is no except for “living standard of the worker". Therefore, it should be sufficiently regarded on this principle in the business administration side. And, I would advocate that it should be equal agreement determination by the “consensus" formation among business management and laborers on the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> administration system. まえがき　Abstract　基本用語　第 1 章 序　第 2 章 賃金管理に影響を与える理論 第 1 節 賃金管理といくつかの立場 第 2 節 賃金問題に関する理論 第 1 項 賃金の法律理論(賃金問題への法の介入) 第 2 項 賃金の経済理論(労働市場における賃金水準の存在) 第 3 項 賃金の社会理論(賃金決定の際に考慮されるべき要因) 第 4 項 賃金の経営理論(労務管理の実体としての賃金管理) 第 3 節 賃金管理と賃金支払制度 第 3 章 我国企業の賃金管理制度における現実の動向 第 1 節 年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱却 第 2 節 我国企業における新しい賃金支払制度の採用 第 1 項 成果分配制度 〈成果分配制度導入企業の実例〉 第 2 項 年俸制 〈年俸制導入企業の実例〉 第 3 節 職務給制度採用の妥当性 第 1 項 高齢化・国際化が要請する年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱皮の試み 第 2 項 職務評価と職務給制度 第 4 章 賃金支払制度と職務給制度 第 1 節 賃金問題と賃金支払制度 第 2 節 賃金支払制度の形態 第 3 節 職務給制度の発展 第 1 項 職務給制度の前身としての計測日給制度 第 2 項 職務給制度と労働能力 第 3 項 職務給制度における賃金体系 第 4 項 賃金規程の実例および職務給制度導入企業の実例 第 4 節 “意思決定"要素による職務評価(バターソン法) 第 1 項 評価要素および評価尺度 第 2 項 職務評価手続き 第 3 項 パターソン法による職務評価の事例(化学工業会社の場合) 第 4 項 パターソン法についてのまとめ 第 5 章 賃金支払制度と賃金額 第 1 節 賃金支払制度の賃金額への結合 第 2 節 賃金管理の原理 第 3 節 賃金管理制度の実施における留意点 第 1 項 賃金の刺激性 第 2 項 賃金とその不満集約性 第 6 章 結 ※注釈 ※参考文献 ※資料①～...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{estimate}} the truncated right tail of the annual <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> income distribution 2 using {{the rest of the}} distribution. The right tail of the <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> income distribution is the distribution of earners over large <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> incomes. See figure 1. The metaphor of regenerating a tail that has been cut off suggests the name of this paper’s model: the Salamander. The model is in need of a name more compact than “a mixture of gamma probability density functions (pdfs) with parameters quite restricted in a particular way”. The U. S.

25|$|Just as higher-income {{groups are}} more likely to enjoy {{financial}} gains when economic times are good, they are also likely to suffer more significant income losses during economic downturns and recessions when they are compared to lower income groups. Higher-income groups tend to derive relatively more of their income from more volatile sources related to capital income (business income, capital gains, and dividends), as opposed to labor income (<b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>salaries).</b> For example, in 2011 the top 1% of income earners derived 37% of their income from labor income, versus 62% for the middle quintile. On the other hand, the top 1% derived 58% of their income from capital as opposed to 4% for the middle quintile. Government transfers represented only 1% of the income of the top 1% but 25% for the middle quintile; the dollar amounts of these transfers tend to rise in recessions.|$|E
40|$|Great social {{inequality}} {{has been one}} of the worrisome features of economic development in Latin America. This study focuses on Chile, one of Latin America's fastest growing economies with one of the highest levels of income inequality during the 1990 s. Using micro-level data from the 1994 and 2000 Encuestas de Caracterizacion Socio-Economica, this article examines the role of work contracts in explaining male and female earnings and earnings inequality among <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> workers over the second half of the 1990 s. The analysis distinguishes between <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> work without a work contract - referred to as 'informal' work, <b>and</b> <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> work with a work contract. Within the latter group, the study further differentiates by the type of work contract held, such as permanent and a variety of contingent work contracts. The findings reveal that the majority of employees in informal <b>and</b> contingent <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> work arrangements earned significantly less than their permanent counterparts. Additionally, informal <b>and</b> contingent <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> work arrangements accounted for a small, although increasing, fraction of male and female earnings inequality from 1994 to 2000.

40|$|Bankruptcies, {{more than}} ever and bigger than ever, have {{followed}} our credit administration of the past decade. In 1921 our total technical bankrupts were officially reported at 15, 200. In 1931, this number reached 60, 322. Outstanding in this history are <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> earners. In numbers, <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> earner bankruptcies increased from 5, 928 in 1921 to 29, 814 in 1931. Whereas they constituted 39 per cent of the total of our bankrupts in 1921, that ratio had increased to 49 per cent in 1931. In other words, in 1931 almost one-half of our technical bankrupts were <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> earners. Furthermore, {{there is evidence to}} support the conclusion that a greater percentage of 2 ̆ 2 no-assets 2 ̆ 2 estates is found in our <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> earners 2 ̆ 7 bankruptcies than in any other class of bankrupts. Thus, the bankruptcy records for the fiscal year 1930 have been analyzed to show that 84. 90 per cent of the estates of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> earners in bankruptcy had no assets and that 98. 17 per cent of those estates had assets per estate of less than 500 in value. It may also be observed that all but a small fraction of our <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> earner bankruptcies are instituted by a voluntary petition. In 1921, there were 31 involuntary petitions among the 5, 928 <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> <b>salary</b> earner bankruptcies; 5, 897 were voluntary petitions.

If the Government recognises its responsibility then all notices will be withdrawn." [...] Later, the Deputy Council leader Derek Hatton and Militant's national general secretary Taaffe saw later as a great error, although the Council set a legal budget in November 1985 after borrowing £30 million.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Mauroy government's social {{policies}} improved the living {{standards of the}} less well-off in French society, its reflationary economic strategy (based on encouraging domestic consumption) failed to improve the French economy in the long term, with increases {{in the level of}} inflation {{as well as in the}} trade and budget deficits. Although the government’s reflationary policies tended to stabilise unemployment, the number of people out of work topped 2million, in spite of a pledge made by Mitterrand to keep it below this figure. A large budget deficit emerged, with social benefits and aid to industry alone going up by 50% in the 1982 budget. In addition, private investment failed to respond to the government’s initiatives, with a 12% decline in volume in 1981. This led Mauroy to advocate the abandonment of Socialist economic policies (which failed to reduce unemployment and inflation), a controversial [...] "U-turn" [...] which was ratified by President Mitterrand in March 1983, and a number of austerity measures were carried out. In 1982, housing allowances were decoupled from the cost-of-living adjustment index. In 1982 and 1983, eligibility for unemployment benefits was tightened. A complex set of changes introduced in 1983 surrounding early retirement effectively reduced guarantees to full pensions for early retirees. Daily charges for hospital beds were introduced, while a variety of medical reimbursements were reduced. In September 1982, the indexation of <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> <b>salaries</b> in the public sector was abolished.|$|E
