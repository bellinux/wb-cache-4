With a 70% voter turnout there was about 90% approval for hosting of the disposal facility. The site is approximately 2.1 km^2. Data collected during site characterization were used for an assessment of long term performance based partly on its hydrogeological and geochemical characteristics, and groundwater flow modeling. An environmental impact assessment was derived from this data as well. The permeability of the soils underlying the silo site is on the lower bound of the regions values. This is in favor of selecting the site for a storage facility, as lower permeability is correlated to slower movement of groundwater and minerals. The site was approved of by the local people due to increased incentives: the prospect of jobs, the promise of an initial payment of Three hundred billion Won ($270 million) with additional payments of 637,500 Won per <b>waste</b> <b>drum,</b> and the relocation to the city hosting the silo site of the headquarters of the Korean Hydro and nuclear Power ...|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} passive neutron counter, the high-efficiency neutron counter (HENC), {{has been}} used to measure plutonium content in 200 -L <b>waste</b> <b>drums.</b> The HENC was designed with the {sup 252 }Cf add-a-source (AS) feature to improve accuracy over a wide range of waste matrix materials. The current implementation allows for passive neutron coincidence counting, AS analysis, and multiplicity analysis. Passive neutron assay of typical waste containers is intrinsically more accurate than active neutron techniques because of the penetrability of the spontaneous fission neutrons originating from within the waste matrix. In addition, the HENC is designed as a slightly undermoderated detector to be less sensitive to low loading of hydrogen-bearing matrices.

40|$|In view of {{long-term}} radioactive waste repository, the Differential Die away Technique (DDT) {{can be used}} to determine the amount of fissile materials, mainly 239 Pu and 235 U, in 225 L bituminized <b>waste</b> <b>drums</b> by detecting prompt and delayed fission neutrons between the pulses of a deuterium-tritium neutron generator. A complementary approach studied in this paper is to detect fission delayed gamma rays.

Typically, <b>waste</b> <b>drums</b> containing metal matrices are assayed for plutonium content using passive neutron coincidence counting techniques. The presence of trace quantities of Cm- 244 prevents this type of analysis because of the strong coincidence signal created by spontaneous fission of Cm- 244. To discriminate between the plutonium and curium materials present, an active neutron measurement technique was used. A Cf shuffler designed for measurement of uranium bearing materials was calibrated for plutonium in the active mode. The <b>waste</b> <b>drums</b> were then assayed for plutonium content in the shuffler using the active-mode calibration. The curium contamination levels were estimated from {{the difference between the}} active-mode measurement in the shuffler and a passive assay in a neutron coincidence counter. Far field gamma-ray measurements were made to identify additional radioactive contaminants and to corroborate the plutonium measurement results obtained from the active-mode assay.

40|$|Development of the gamma-ray spectrometric {{technique}} termed GSAK (Gamma-Ray Spectrometry with Acceptable Knowledge) for {{the characterization}} of CC 104 / 107 remote-handled transuranic (RH-TRU) wastes continued this year. Proof-of-principle measurements have been completed on the surrogate RH-TRU waste drums configured earlier this year. The GSAK technique uses conventional gamma-ray spectrometry to quantify the detectable fission product content of overpacked RH-TRU drums. These results are then coupled with the inventory report to characterize the <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> content. The inventory report is based on process knowledge of the <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> loading and calculations of the isotopic distribution in the spent fuel examined to generate the drummed wastes. Three RH-TRU surrogate drums were configured with encapsulated EBR-II driver fuel rod segments arranged in the surrogate drum assemblies. Segment-specific inventory calculations initially specified the radionuclide content of the fuel segments and thus the surrogate drums. Radiochemical assays performed on representative fuel element segments identified {{a problem in the}} accuracy of some of the fission and activation product inventory values and provided a basis for adjustment of the specified surrogate drum inventories. The three <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> surrogates, contained within their 8. 9 cm (3. 5 inch) thick steel overpacks, were analyzed by gamma-ray spectrometry at the TREAT facility at Argonne National Laboratory-West.

40|$|For {{the past}} few years, the Department of Energy has favored the direct {{disposal}} of low plutonium content residue materials from Rocky Flats rather than engage in expensive and time consuming plutonium recovery operations. One impediment to direct disposal has been the wattage limit imposed by the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant on hydrogenous materials such as combustibles and sludges. The issue of concern is the radiolytic generation and accumulation of hydrogen and other explosive gases in waste containers. The wattage limits that existed through 1996 restricted the amount of plutonium bearing hydrogenous materials that could be packaged in a WIPP bound <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> to {{only a fraction of}} the capacity of a drum. Typically, only about one kilogram of combustible residue could be packaged in a <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> before the wattage limit was exceeded resulting in an excessively large number of drums to be procured, stored, shipped, and interred. The Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site has initiated the use of filtered plastic bags (called bag-out bags) used to remove transuranic waste materials from glove box lines. The bags contain small, disk like HEPA filters which are effective in containing radioactively contaminated particulate material but allow for the diffusion of hydrogen gas. Used in conjunction with filtered 55 gallon drums, filtered bag-out bags were pursued as a means to increase the allowable wattage limits for selected residue materials. In February 1997, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the use of filtered bag-out bags for transuranic waste materials destined for WIPP. The concomitant increase in wattage limits now allows for approximately four times the payload per <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> for wattage limited materials...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: X-ray imaging is a {{suitable}} technique for nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>drums</b> inspection, especially large and highly attenuating ones. It requires an energy source greater than 6 MeV and dose rate over 0. 1 Gy/s. Controlling <b>waste</b> <b>drums</b> {{calls for a}} multi-level strategy: from systematic and fast controls to specific or detailed examinations. Using a high energy (8 MeV) experimental set-up, we have studied and validated different modalities for X-ray inspection of these drums: radiography, radioscopy, tomosynthesis, and tomography. Various types of detectors can be used, all of them dedicated to high energy: large screen imager, CdTe-unit detector, linear array. They differ on induced geometry acquisition, global acquisition time, resolution, and possible modalities. Data collection therefore also differs from one device to another. Introduction: X-ray imaging is an attractive technology for both low level and intermediate nuclear waste inspection, and may even deal with high level ones in some cases. Due to the density and size of nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>drums,</b> a high energy source is required. A 2 MeV system is transportable on a trailer, but does not allow to inspect drums that are too attenuating.

40|$|Pretest waste {{characterization}} for the bin-scale {{tests at}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) required sampling for {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCS) from within transuranic (TRU) waste drums. Although the bin-scale tests have been postponed, the development and demonstration of accurate waste characterization methods continues. The objectives of extensive sampling of waste drums are to obtain a representative sample from each layer of confinement to identify volatile and gaseous constituents, verify process knowledge of the drum contents, and demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. A method to estimate the VOC concentration between layers of confinement from a single headspace sample collected beneath the drum filter of a vented <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> is investigated.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the analysis {{is to examine the}} potential for lid ejection from a vented transuranic (TRU) <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> due to pressure buildup caused by the deflagration of hydrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside the drum. In this analysis, the AICC pressure for a stoichiometric mixture of VOCs is calculated and then compared against the experimental peak pressure of stoichiometric combustion of propane and hexane in a combustion chamber. The experimental peak pressures of propane and hexane are about 12 percent lower than the calculated AICC pressure. Additional losses in the drum are calculated due to venting of the gases, drum bulging, waste compaction, and heat losses from the presence of waste in the drum. After accounting for these losses, the final pressures are compared to the minimum observed pressure that ejects the lid from a TRU drum. The ejection pressure of 105 psig is derived from data that was recorded for a series of tests where hydrogen-air mixtures were ignited inside sealed TRU drums. Since the calculated pressures are below the minimum lid ejection pressure, none of the VOCs and the hydrogen (up to 4 percent) mixtures present in the TRU <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> is expected to cause lid ejection if ignited. The analysis of potential VOC deflagrations in a vented TRU drum can be applied across the DOE-Complex since TRU waste is stored in drums throughout the complex...|$|E

WIT uses various computed tomography (CT) methods for both NDE and NDA of nuclear waste drums. Low level waste (LLW), transuranic (TRU), and mixed radioactive waste can be inspected and characterized without opening the drums. With externally transmitted x-ray NDE techniques, WIT {{has the ability}} to identify high density waste materials like heavy metals, define drum contents in two- and three-dimensional space, quantify free liquid volumes through density and x-ray attenuation coefficient discrimination, and measure drum wall thickness. With waste emitting gamma-ray NDA techniques, WIT can locate gamma emitting radioactive sources in two- and three-dimensional space, identify gamma emitting isotopic species, identify the external activity levels of emitting gamma-ray sources, correct for waste matrix attenuation, provide internal activity approximations, and provide the data needed for waste classification as LLW or TRU. The mobile feature of WIT allows inspection technologies to be brought to the nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>drum</b> storage site without the need to relocate drums for safe, rapid, and cost-effective characterization of regulated nuclear waste. The combination of these WIT characterization modalities provides the inspector with an unprecedented ability to non-invasively characterize the regulated contents of waste drums as large as 110 gallons, weighing up to 1, 600 pounds.

Two on-site facilities, the northwest (NW) vaults in the 317 Area and the converted {{spent nuclear fuel}} pool in Building 331, were identified as potential storage locations through previous studies. To assist the decision making process of selecting a storage location, radiological risk assessments were conducted to analyze potential radiation exposures that {{would be associated with}} storage of the RH/TRU waste in these two facilities. Three drum storage scenarios (one for the 317 Area and two for Building 331) considering different drum handling procedures and stacking patterns were developed.
