This {{was to be a}} key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant Vafthrudnir (and which was, of course, unanswerable) in the poem Vafthrudnismal. The riddle also appears in the riddles of Gestumblindi in Hervarar saga.|$|E

When she asked him how he knew Hebrew, he told her he was an Israeli. And what work had he done in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E

[...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should {{like to see you}} again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come...

500|$|At Stoke, Matthews {{found himself}} playing Second Division {{football}} {{for the first}} time in 28 years. Despite Stoke being strapped for cash, Tony Waddington gave him a two-year contract at £50 a week – this was double the wages he received at Blackpool. The signing was broadcast live on Sportsweek, as Waddington <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> his ear [...] "Welcome home, Stan. For years this club has been going nowhere. Now we're on our way". Waddington delayed his return debut until 24 October 1961, when Stoke played Huddersfield Town at the Victoria Ground, the attendance was 35,974 – more than treble the previous home game – and Matthews set up one of City's goals in a 3–0 win. He went on to score three goals in 21 games in the rest of the 1961–62 campaign.|$|E

Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
500|$|Willis {{built up}} his {{reputation}} in the public {{at a time when}} readers were interested in the personal lives of writers. In his writings, he described the [...] "high life" [...] of the [...] "Upper Ten Thousand", a phrase he coined. His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers. Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as Pencillings by the Way and Dashes at Life With Free Pencil, which downplayed their own quality. His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful. Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing. He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: [...] "We would have you... indulge us in our innocent egotism as if it were all <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> your private ear and over our iced Margaux". When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.|$|E

500|$|The {{surviving}} group regroups on {{the highway}} {{which they had been}} taking to reach Fort Benning {{at the start of the}} season, and assume Andrea is dead. With their remaining vehicles, they travel on back roads to avoid hordes, until one runs out of gas. They camp for the night, where Daryl pressures Rick on how Randall's body had reanimated without a walker bite. Rick reveals what Dr. Edwin Jenner <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> his ear: they are all infected carriers of the walker pathogen, and become walkers if they die for any reason. Rick also reveals that he had been forced to kill Shane, and Carl had shot his reanimated form, shocking Lori. As they continue to debate, the others, save for Daryl and Hershel, start to lose their faith in Rick as a leader. A noise echoing in the distance places the group on high alert, but Rick does not allow anyone to investigate. Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) urges Rick to take action, causing Rick to snap, saying that he never asked that he be put in charge, and blurting out that he had killed Shane for their sake. He dares anyone to leave the safety of the camp. When nobody leaves he issues a final warning: [...] "If you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore," [...] establishing his position as leader of the group. Afterwards it is shown that the group is unknowingly camped near a prison.|$|E

Despite the scandal, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on December 17, 1916. [...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed," [...] Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916.

[...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed," [...] Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916. Tatiana was rumored to have been present at Rasputin's murder on 17 December 1916, [...] "disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her". It was also rumored that Rasputin was castrated in front of Tatiana, wrote Maurice Paléologue, the French ambassador to Russia, in his memoirs. Paléologue was skeptical at the time about the truth of the wild rumors and attributed them to the hatred of Rasputin held by people in St. Petersburg. In his memoirs, A.A.

[...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916, a few weeks before Rasputin was killed. However, as she grew older, Olga was less inclined to see Rasputin as her friend and was more aware of how his friendship with her parents affected the stability of her country. Olga wrote in her diary the day after the murder that she suspected Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed and the man she had at one time been expected to marry, was the murderer of [...] "Father Grigory." [...] Dmitri and Felix Yussupov, the husband of her first cousin Princess Irina of Russia, were among the murderers. In his memoirs, A. A.

However, Olga was {{the only member of the}} family who did not attend Rasputin's funeral, according to the diary of her first cousin once removed Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia. According to the memoirs of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I, Olga said in February 1917, about a month after the murder, that while it might have been necessary for Rasputin to be killed, it should never have been done [...] "so terribly." [...] She was ashamed that the murderers were her relatives. After Olga and her sisters had been killed, the Bolsheviks found that each was wearing an amulet bearing Rasputin's image and a prayer around their necks.|$|E
