25|$|The {{documentary}} was {{notable for}} showing {{a wide range}} of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Suprunyuk and Sayenko are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their Daewoo Lanos taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through binoculars for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked {{to take part in the}} documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director Jorge Olguín, who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{the phrase}} as a {{reference}} to demagoguery and hypocrisy is traced to a Russian political joke about a dispute between an American and a Soviet man. After receiving criticism of his country beca{{use of the}} deaths caused by the 1905 anti-Jewish Kishinev pogrom, the Russian Ambassador to the United States pointed out [...] "Americans had recently lynched blacks". The Russian Ambassador said locals engaged in violence when drunk, [...] "just like Americans." [...] Soviet artist Dmitri Moor produced the lithograph Freedom to the Prisoners of Scottsboro!, after the 1931 trial of the Scottsboro Boys of Alabama. The treatment of the Scottsboro Boys popularized the phrase in usage by the Soviet Union against the U.S. {{as a form of}} criticism against those who themselves criticized human rights abuses. In his 1934 book Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?, Sherwood Eddy wrote: [...] "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do to the Scottsboro Negro boys and why they lynch Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Kreisberg {{described}} the episodes as {{very important to}} both Barry and Oliver and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> thorough, while also promising [...] "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode". Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I {{think part of the}} fun is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.|$|E

500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> for." ...|$|E
500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E
2500|$|International media, {{including}} the Soviet Union, covered racial {{discrimination in the}} U.S. Deeming American criticism of Soviet Union human rights abuses as hypocrisy the Russians would respond with [...] "And you are lynching Negroes".

[...] On January 6, 2013, Spitzer announced that he had left both Viewpoint and Current TV, and that he would not be joining Current TV in its latest venture with Al Jazeera. [...] "Moving forward, their mission will be different," [...] he said. He also stated: [...] "For me, journalism has been more a matter of projecting a particular approach to covering policies, to covering issues. It was a continuation of what I tried to do in government. And that doesn't fit with their vision of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Duncan Smith {{studied a}} state-sponsored {{relationship}} education programme in Norway, under which couples {{were forced to}} [...] "think again" [...] and confront the reality of divorce before formally separating. The policy has been credited with reversing Norway’s trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to £100billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to [...] "work through {{what is going to}} happen with their children", which has [...] "a very big effect on their thinking". [...] "Many of them think again about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|In France, pre-hospital care is {{performed}} either by first responders {{from the fire}} department (sapeurs-pompiers, in most emergency situations) or from a private ambulance company (relative emergency at home), or by a medical team that includes a physician, a nurse and an ambulance technician (called [...] "SMUR"). The intermediate scale, the firefighter nurse (infirmier sapeur-pompier, ISP), is only a recent evolution and {{is performed}} by nurses who have been specially trained acting with emergency protocols; these nurses are the French equivalent of paramedics. The arrival of first responders is thus the most common result of an emergency call. In addition, in France there exists a network of first responder associations, as French Red Cross (Croix-rouge française), civil protection (protection civile), FFSS (Fédération Française de Sauvetage et de Secourisme) or others. These CFR volunteers are allowed to supervise massive outside meetings, student gatherings, et cetera. These volunteers have followed the same special rescuer training as firefighters (PSE 1 & PSE 2, in all 70 hours of training), trainees always know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> into, they would be given basic medical training then transferred to the Fire Department, they shall always show humanistic interaction, and shall assist and help people with their concerns.(( [...] firefighter))s ((PSE1-PSE2)) ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodora was {{followed}} by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, Marion Delorme, written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not {{give her a chance}} to show her talents. She next put on Hamlet, with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful. Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: [...] "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{not just}} the {{situation}} in Tunisia and Egypt {{but also on the}} 2011 Yemeni protests, and the 2011 Jordanian protests, Clinton said at a February 5 meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, [...] "The region is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends. ... This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of ... cities throughout the region. The status quo is simply not sustainable." [...] She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, {{and the rule of law}} in order to be effective – in the end [...] "free people govern themselves best". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters [...] "is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform." [...] At the same time, she said that the U.S. [...] "cannot tell countries <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do [...] cannot dictate the outcomes." [...] As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, [...] "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so." ...|$|E
