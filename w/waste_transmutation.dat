40|$|Along with {{mechanization}} {{and scientific}} plant breeding, modern forms of industrial agriculture are {{premised on the}} use of synthetic chemicals to sustain yield, irrigate fields, decrease erosion, and provide defense against pests and disease. Chemicalized agriculture has its origins in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries as the presence of industrially produced chemicals became available on domestic and international markets, as crop production specialized, and as scientists, farmers, and policy makers turned to chemicals to “fix” fertility, pest, and labor issues. While the use of agricultural chemicals has created the conditions for astonishing yields, their generalized use has also resulted in the pollution and degradation of ecosystems, harmful effects on consumers and farm workers, and large greenhouse gas emissions. This dissertation investigates the relationships between the late 19 th and early 20 th century US mining, chemical, and petroleum refining industries, their waste byproducts, and the promotion and naturalization of economic poisons in US agriculture. Specifically, I explore the transition from the ad hoc use of economic poisons on US farms to the use of economic poisons as an agricultural necessity by focusing on the complex and multidirectional links between industrial and chemical waste and the use of a rapidly industrializing and specializing agriculture as an efficacious and profitable outlet for industrial byproducts. Drawing from fourteen archives across the US, I use the history of mining and smelting companies, chemical and petrochemical manufacturers, marketers and dealers, industrial R&D, governmental institutions, university scientists and extension agents, capital investment, environmental regulation, the military, along with politics of an inchoate toxicological science, to narrate the political economic thresholds of industrial <b>waste’s</b> <b>transmutation</b> and US agriculture’s chemicalization.

40|$|AbstractA {{reduction}} of nuclear <b>waste</b> by <b>transmutation</b> of trans-uranium elements (TRUs), such as Pu and Minor Actinides (MAs) contained in Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF), {{is a goal}} for future reactors. In general, countries with on-going nuclear scenarios would profit from MA mass stabilization, while transmutation of Pu and MAs from SNF could be desired in countries in nuclear phase-out. Both missions {{can be accomplished by}} employing fast reactors loaded with fuels containing different amounts of Pu and MAs in a closed (or partially closed) fuel cycle. In this paper, two 1200 MWth sodium-cooled fast reactor cores, based on the French ASTRID design, are proposed for burning TRUs (phase-out option) or only MAs (on-going option). Main attention is focused on the safety and on the transmutation performance. The coolant void effect, in the region including the core and the plenum above and the Doppler constant of both systems are negative also with irradiated fuel. The conversion ratios (CR) of the Pu and MA burners are in the ranges from 0. 6 to 0. 7 and from 0. 5 to 0. 6, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} fission yields {{has a major}} impact on the {{characterization}} and understanding of the fission process and is mandatory for reactor applications. While the yields are known for the major actinides (235 U, 239 Pu) in the thermal neutron-induced fission, only few measurements have been performed on 242 Am. The interest of 242 Am concerns the reduction of radiotoxicity of 241 Am in nuclear <b>wastes</b> using <b>transmutation</b> reactions. This paper presents the measurement of the fission mass yields from the reaction 241 Am(2 nth,f) performed at the Lohengrin mass spectrometer (ILL, France) for both the light and the heavy peaks: a total of 41 mass yields have been measured. The experiment was also meant to determine whether there is a difference in mass yields between the isomeric state and the ground state as it exists in fission and capture cross sections. The method used to address this question is based on a repeated measurement of a set of fission mass yields {{as a function of the}} ratio between the 242 gAm and the 242 mAm fission rates. The presented experiment is also a first step towards the measurement of the isotopic fission yields of 242 Am. ...|$|R

In this context, the role of nuclear power may be emphasized in the years to come. Nevertheless, the problems of nuclear waste, safety and proliferation still remain to be solved. It is believed that the use of accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) for nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>transmutation</b> and energy production would address these problems in a simple, clean and economically viable, and therefore sustainable, manner. This thesis covers the major nuclear physics aspects of ADSs, in particular the spallation process and the core neutronics specific to this type of systems. The need for accurate nuclear data is described, together with a detailed analysis of the specific isotopes and energy ranges in which this data needs to be improved and the impact of their uncertainty. Preliminary experimental results for some of these isotopes, produced by the Neutron Time-of-Flight (n_TOF) experiment at CERN, are also presented. The detailed design analysis of the TRIGA Accelerator-Driven Experiment (TRADE), the first ADS experiment at real power, is presented together with the time evolution of the system and some investigations which validate the concept of transmutation in ADSs. A further design of the Energy Amplifier Demonstrator Facility (EADF), an 80 MWth leadbismuth cooled subcritical device, is presented, where the intrinsic advantages of the use of fast neutrons and the safety features of the device are demonstrated, using a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo burn-up code (EA-MC). Finally, Several high-level <b>waste</b> <b>transmutation</b> strategies are assessed.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{an approach to}} tritium production based {{on the use of}} multiple proton linear accelerators. Features of a single APTT Linac as proposed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory are presented and discussed. An alternative approach to the attainment of the same total proton beam power of 200 MW with several lower-performance superconducting Linacs is proposed and discussed. Although each of these accelerators are considerable extrapolations of present technology, the latter can nevertheless be built at less technical risk when compared to the single high-current APT Linac, particularly concerning the design and the performance of the low-energy front-end. The use of superconducting cavities is also proposed as a way of optimizing the accelerating gradient, the overall length, and the operational costs. The superconducting technology has already been successfully demonstrated in a number of large-size projects and should be seriously considered for the acceleration of intense low-energy beams of protons.

At the end of 2001, there were 438 nuclear power plants operating in the world representing some 353 GW(e) of generating capacity. According to the projections published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the median electricity increase till 2050 will be {{by a factor of}} almost 5. It is reasonable to assume that nuclear energy will play a role in meeting this demand growth. However, there are four major challenges facing the long-term development of nuclear energy {{as a part of the}} world’s energy mix: improvement of the economic competitiveness, meeting increasingly stringent safety requirements, adhering to the criteria of sustainable development, and public acceptability. Meeting the sustainability criteria is the driving force behind the topic of this paper. More specifically, in this context sustainability has two aspects: natural resources and waste management. IAEA’s activities in the area of Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) are mostly in response to the latter. While not involving the large quantities of gaseous products and toxic solid wastes associated with fossil fuels, radioactive waste disposal is today’s dominant public acceptance issue. In fact, small waste quantities permit a rigorous confinement strategy, and mined geological disposal is the strategy followed by some countries. Nevertheless, political opposition arguing that this does not yet constitute a safe disposal technology has largely stalled these efforts. One of the primary reasons that are cited is the long life of many of the radioisotopes generated from fission. This concern has led to increased R&D efforts to develop a technology aimed at reducing the amount of long-lived radioactive <b>waste</b> through <b>transmutation</b> in fission reactors or accelerator-driven hybrids.

40|$|Brian Josephson appealed at {{the meeting}} of the Nobel Laureates July 2004 against the ignorance of {{physicist}} to the phenomenon of cold fusion. Though there are good reasons against many publications on this topic but not for all what was reported. It seems to be indicated to summarize the following serious, reproducible and confirmed observations on the reactions of protons or deuterons incorporated in host metals such as palladium, nickel and other metals. We underline the confusing discovery by Cockroft and Oliphant with the anomalous low energy for nuclear reactions which was hundred times lower than in the usual cases when smashing nuclei against their Coulomb potential. A similar unexpected result was that of Otto Hahn&# 8217;s-the chemist!-Discovery of fission that had changed the world. A significant result of cold fusion was seen in gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant and fully reproducible, e. g. From the &# 8220;life after death&# 8221; heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect-preferably in the swimming electron layer-may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U off about mega seconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the generation of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-mega second reactions of cold fusion. Other theoretical aspects are given from measured heavy element distributions similar to the standard abundance distribution, SAD, in the Universe with consequences on endothermic heavy nucleus generation, magic numbers and to quark-gluon plasmas.

Only coal power plants have been increasing (3 %/year) generating capacity (Annual Energy Outlook, 1998) [1]. Likewise, the ability of fusion to deliver economical electrical power has not been credibly postulated, much less demonstrated. Together these two factors have stagnated the commercialization of fusion power. It is now time for a reassessment of what fusion can best do for the world.
