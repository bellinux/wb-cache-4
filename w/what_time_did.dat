6000|$|But though 'tis an {{interesting}} one, {{and though the}} Margrave won, yet he could not keep his attention on the cards: so agitated was his mind by the dreadful secret which weighed upon it. In the midst of their play, the obsequious Gottfried came to whisper a word in his patron's ear, which threw the latter into such a fury, that apoplexy was apprehended by the two lookers-on. But the Margrave mastered his emotion. [...] "AT <b>WHAT</b> <b>TIME,</b> <b>did</b> you say?" [...] said he to Gottfried.|$|E

5000|$|In an often-replayed segment from a 1969 {{episode of}} The Tonight Show, Gobel {{followed}} Bob Hope and Dean Martin, walking onstage {{with a plastic}} cup with an unidentified drink. Gobel ribbed Carson about coming on last and having to follow major stars Hope and Martin. He quipped to Carson, [...] "Did you ever {{get the feeling that}} the world was a tuxedo and you were a pair of brown shoes?", to which Carson, Hope, Martin, and the audience came unglued with laughter. After the laughter died down, Carson asked Gobel about his career in World War II as a fighter pilot. Gobel feigned bewilderment at why people laugh when he says that he spent the war in Oklahoma, pointing out that no Japanese plane ever got past Tulsa. Gobel also began to get some unexpected laughs, being unaware that Dean Martin had begun flicking his cigarette ashes into Gobel's drink. Observing all of this, Carson finally asked rhetorically, [...] "Exactly <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> I lose control of the show?!" ...|$|E

40|$|Aspects of {{the origin}} and {{development}} of the early (AE) continential crust are addressed by radiogenic isotope and trace element studies. The most important ones are: (1) at <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> the earliest continental crust form; (2) what was its composition; (3) by what processes did it grow and by what processes was it destroyed; (4) what were the rates of production and destruction as a function of time during this time period? Nd is isotopic data on the oldest terrestrial rocks indicate that the mantle at this time had already suffered substantial depletion in incompatible elements due to earlier continent forming events. Isotopic data on young volcanic rocks derived from the depleted mantle show no evidence of this early history. The observed isotopic patterns of Nd, Sr, Hf and Pb through time together with the presently observed age spectrum of crustal rocks are considered. These patterns can be modelled by a transport model in which the continental growth and destruction rates are allowed to vary as a function of time. It is suggest that the mass of the continents at 3. 8 AE ago was about 25 % of the current continental mass. However, due to the very high recycling rates obtained in the early Archean only a few percent of this crust has been preserved up to the present...|$|E
