50|$|The Central Florida (Bone Valley) {{phosphorite}} deposits {{are considered}} to contain the largest known uranium resource (one million metric tons of uranium oxide) in North America (but note that resources {{are not the same}} as ore reserves).

The average uranium content is 0.009%, which is considered to be low grade. Concentrations of uranium in this type of deposit typically grade to 0.01-0.015% U3O8. Recovery process costs are estimated at $22 to $54 per pound of U3O8; higher than the market price of uranium during the 25-year period spanning the 1980s through the early first decade of the 21st century.

40|$|AbstractThe reverse apatite {{flotation}} with {{fatty acids}} {{has been widely}} used for the reduction of phosphorus content of magmatic origin iron ores. However, the occurrence of phosphorus intensely disseminated as secondary minerals such as <b>wavellite</b> renders the anionic reverse flotation a challenge. Zeta potential measurements and microflotation tests of <b>wavellite</b> {{with the use of}} anionic and cationic collectors were carried out in this work. The wavellite’s IEP value was achieved at pH 4. 5. Below the IEP value, the surface positively charged sites are made up of aluminum ions. The species H+,Al(OH) 2 +,Al(OH) 2 +,Al 3 +,OH-,H 2 PO 4 -,HPO 42 -, and PO 43 - {{play a role in the}} protonation and deprotonation reactions that will determine the wavellite-solution interface properties. The highest values of wavellite’s floatability under basic pH conditions were achieved in the presence of cationic collectors (1 × 10 − 4 molL− 1). The formation of surface complexes and the precipitation of insoluble salt of aluminum onto <b>wavellite</b> surface seems to be the most likely hypothesis for the chemical nature interactions between amines and <b>wavellite.</b> The surface formation of aluminum oleate on the wavellite’s surface seems to be the most probable hypothesis for the adsorption mechanism and the resultant high floatability of <b>wavellite</b> between pH 7. 5 and pH 10. 0 in the presence of sodium oleate (1 × 10 − 4 molL− 1). The results showed that the cationic reverse flotation of secondary phosphates is a promising route to reduce the phosphorus content of iron ores from deposits that underwent a supergene enrichment process, since <b>wavellite</b> floatability in the alkaline pH range, using amine as collector, was not significantly affected by the presence of corn starch...|$|E

40|$|Na ilha de Itacupim, localizada na região costeira do nordeste do Pará, foram encontrados veios de fosfatos de alumínio contendo turquesa, além de quartzo e argilominerais. A ilha é sustentada por espesso perfil laterítico maturo desenvolvido sobre complexo alcalino-ultramáfico mineralizado em apatita. Os veios e vênulas são de espessura centimétrica, normalmente constituídos de wavellita fibro-radial, onde pode ser observada turquesa verde-azulada, em massas subesferolíticas, microcristalinas, intercrescidas com caulinita e oxi-hidróxidos de Mn, além de quartzo. A identificação mineral foi realizada por DRX, microscopia óptica, análises químicas de rocha total, MEV/SED. Os teores de CuO são inferiores aos das turquesas em geral, compensados por Fe 2 O 3 e ZnO. Os subesferolitos de turquesa contêm inúmeras inclusões micrométricas de goyazita ou svanbergita.

ABSTRACT: Veins and veinlets of {{aluminum}} phosphates with turquoise {{occur at the}} Itacupim Island in the coastal plain northeast the state of Pará. A thick mature lateritic iron crust rich in aluminum phosphates developed an apatite-bearing alkaline-ultramafic complex which constitutes the Island. The veins and veinlets are cm-thick, usually constituted by <b>wavellite,</b> fibrous to radialfibrous, with bony or porcelaneous aspect, and can turquoise. Pebbles of these phosphates inside of apatite-bearing ultramafic rocks are very common {{at the base of}} the hang wall, and locally form expressive agglomerates. Turquoise forms half spheroids and is bluish-green, microcrystalline, and is intergrown with kaolinite and Mn oxy-hydroxides. The mineral identification was carried out by XRD optic microscopy, chemical analyses by wet methods and by SEM/EDS. The lower CuO values, in comparison to turquoise elsewhere, are compensated by the higher Fe 2 O 3 and ZnO. The spheroids display countless inclusions of micrometric goyazite or svanbergite. The turquoise relation to veins and veinlets with <b>wavellite,</b> goyazite or svanbergite, quartz and clay minerals, its porcelaneous aspect and well-known occurrence of turquoise in hydrothermal environment indicate that the Itacupim turquoise was formed by the same mechanism.

For this study we used solid-state ³¹P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high-power decoupling with magic angle spinning (HPDec–MAS) NMR, and cross polarization with magic angle spinning (CP–MAS) NMR to determine the chemical nature of potentially mobile P associated with aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca) in selected arable soils. Three soils with a range of bicarbonate-extractable Olsen P concentrations (40 – 102 mg P kg⁻¹) were obtained from a long-term field experiment on continuous root crops at Rothamsted, UK, established in 1843 (sampled 1958). This soil has a threshold or change point at 59 mg Olsen P kg⁻¹, above which potentially mobile P (as determined by extraction with water or 0. 01 M CaCl₂) increases much more per unit increase in Olsen P than below this point. Results showed that CaCl₂ and water preferentially extracted Al-P and Ca-P forms, respectively, from the soils. Comparison among the different soils also indicated that potentially mobile P above the threshold was largely present as a combination of soluble and loosely adsorbed (protonated–cross polarized) P forms largely associated with Ca, such as monetite (CaHPO₄) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO₄· 2 H₂O), and some Al-associated P as <b>wavellite.</b> The findings of this study demonstrate that solid-state NMR has the potential to provide accurate information on the chemical nature of soil P species and their potential mobility...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{recycling}} or reuse by pyrolyzing {{crop residue}} has recently elicited increased research interest. However, {{the effects of}} feedstock and pyrolysis conditions on P species have not been fully understood. Such knowledge is important in identifying the agronomic and environmental uses of biochar. Residues of three main Chinese agricultural crops and the biochars (produced at 300  °C– 600  °C) derived from these crops {{were used to determine}} P transformations during pyrolysis. Hedley sequential fractionation and 31 P NMR analyses were used in the investigation. Our results showed that P transformation in biochar was significantly affected by pyrolysis temperature regardless of feedstock (Wheat straw, maize straw and peanut husk). Pyrolysis treatment transformed water soluble P into a labile (NaHCO 3 -Pi) or semi-labile pool (NaOH-Pi) and into a stable pool (Dil. HCl P and residual-P). At the same time, organic P was transformed into inorganic P fractions which was identified by the rapid decomposition of organic P detected with solution 31 P NMR. The P transformation during pyrolysis process suggested more stable P was formed at a higher pyrolysis temperature. This result was also evidenced by the presence of less soluble or stable P species, such as such as poly-P, crandallite (CaAl 3 (OH) 5 (PO 4) 2) and <b>Wavellite</b> (Al 3 (OH) 3 (PO 4) 2 · 5 H 2 O), as detected by solid-state 31 P NMR in biochars formed at a higher pyrolysis temperature.

40|$|Phosphates {{are among}} the most complex and {{variegated}} compounds in the entire mineral kingdom. Currently the total number of distinctive phosphate species is about 300 and most of them contains hydrogen as OH, H 2 O or in HPO 4 2 - group. Hydrogen bond has a central role in stabilizing the hydroxy-hydrated phosphate (HHPh) structures because it supplies the additional bond-valence (0. 1 - 0. 3 vu) contribution to the anions. Hence the (PO 4) groups can link easily to all other interstitial cations (Huminicki & Hawthorne, 2002). For this reason, most HHPhs are characterized by the presence of complex tridimensional networks of O-H…O hydrogen bonds, which connect the polyhedral units making up a three dimensional framework. Consequently, the dimensionality of the structural unit is controlled primarily by the amount and role of hydrogen in the structure (Hawthorne, 1998). This could explain the observed correlation between the position in the paragenetic sequence of pegmatitic phosphates, and the amount of H 2 O in their formula (Fisher, 1958). FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the study of hydrogen in minerals, but HHPhs are rather challenging to study because of their complex structures. Moreover, due the high OH/H 2 O contents, these minerals show extremely intense IR absorptions in the OH region. In this work, we describe the results obtained by IR spectroscopy in different spectral regions of selected phosphates (veszelyite, whiteite, vauxite, paravauxite, metavauxite, augelite, wardite, <b>wavellite,</b> lazulite, arrojadite). O-H and hydrogen bonds orientation were studied by single crystal polarized light m-IR-spectroscopy, and experiments at HT- and LT were performed to study phase transitions and dehydration mechanisms with the aim of defining the thermal stability of these minerals.

40|$|Turquoise is a {{hydrated}} copper aluminum phosphate and {{belongs to}} a group of minerals, the turquoise group, consisting of at least six isostructural end-members. Turquoise is common in the American Southwest, Iran and Egypt, where most of its value is associated with art, jewelry and ancient culture. When affected by near-surface conditions and extended exposure to sunlight and meteoric (rain) water, turquoise weathers to chalky white clay minerals. This alteration affects identification of the provenance regions of archaeologically recovered turquoise artifacts, the mineralogical properties of turquoise, and the value of turquoise as a semi-precious gemstone. However, this alteration process is poorly understood. Therefore, to improve the characterization of turquoise provenance for archaeological and gemological purposes, {{it is important to understand}} the alteration processes that affect turquoise. The general formula for the turquoise group can be written as A 0 – 1 B 6 (PO 4) 4 (OH) 8 ∙ 4 H 2 O with Cu 2 + or Fe 2 + as the most common constituents at the A position and Al 3 + and Fe 3 + at the B position. However, Ca 2 + or Zn 2 + can occur at the A position in some of the more rare members of the turquoise group. The range in chemical composition (different concentrations of Cu, Fe, and Al) of turquoise (latu sensu) produces a wide range of colors. Foord and Taggart (1998) suggest that differ¬ences in the Cu and Fe ratio are responsible for the differences in color of the samples: blue turquoise has Cu at the A position and Al at the B position, whereas green turquoise (chalcosiderite) largely contains Fe 3 + at the B position. The crystal structure of turquoise is triclinic, space group P¯ 1. Different site nomenclatures have been used in many of the structural and spectroscopic studies of the minerals of the turquoise group, depending on the chemical compositions under study. The turquoise samples belong to the collection of the Real Museo Mineralogico (RMM), Centro Musei delle Scienze Naturali, Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II. Five turquoise samples covering a wide range of compositions in the turquoise group and in provenance were analyzed by X ray diffraction (XRD), electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), BSE-SEM-EDS analysis, LA-ICP-MS analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The provenances of the turquoise samples used in this study are: Tur 1 (RMM catalogue E 5683) Sinai, Egitto; Tur 2 (E 7666) Santa Fè S. Miguel, New Mexico; Tur 3 (E 1675) Sassonia, Germania; Tur 4 (E 7272) Montebras Creuse, Francia; Tur 5 (E 1670 / 13131) Nischapir, Khorassan, Iran. The colors of Tur 1 sample are blue-green and light blue. The EMPA analysis show the presences in Tur 1 of faustite, altered turquoise, crandallite, quartz and magnetite. The turquoise samples display evidence of alteration from weathering processes, showing deficiencies in both cations and anion groups, indicated by EMPA, but preserving the crystal structure of turquoise, as verified by XRD. They also show large amounts of Si and Ca in their microprobe data, due to the presence of quartz and Ca crandallite, respectively, which are identified by XRD analyses. The chemical analysis show the presences in Tur 2, that is blue-green and white, of: turquoise, turquoise ferrian, ferrian variscite, variscite. The XRD analyses indicate the presence also of metavariscite and planerite. Locally in the fracture the EDS-BSE analyses show the presence of iron sulfates and potassium rich silcates. For Tur 3 sample, apple green and light green coloured, the EMPA analysis indicate the presences of Chalcosiderite and variscite; the XRD analyses show the presence also of metavariscite. The colors of Tur 4 sample is turquoise blue, pale blue and white. The EMPA analysis show the presences of turquoise, variscite and <b>wavellite,</b> the XDR pattern also of metavariscite, planerite and quartz. Blue-green, turquoise blue and pale blue Tur 5, on the basis of EMPA analysis is composed by turquoise and ferrian turquoise, the XRD also by metavariscite, planerite and quartz. The EDS-BSE analyses confirm the presence of quartz and cuprian planerite in the fracture of the sample. The pattern of REE elements indicate similarities between Tur 4 and Tur 1, and between Tur 2 and Tur 5. The trace elements particularly V, Ti, Mn, Cr, Ga for the turquoise minerals group, would be useful to be able to distinguish the samples from different localities. Powder samples for FTIR study were prepared as KBr pellets. The spectra are different on the bases of the mineralogical composition of the turquoise samples analyzed. From what has been published spectra closer to the typical turquoise are those Tur 1, Tur 2 and Tur 5. The Tur 4 begins to differentiate more clearly, and finally the Tur 3 is clearly different and seems to be similar to that of variscite. Particularly the absorption frequencies of OH and H 2 O show marked variations in both the width of the bands in the presence of different components. High-frequency components appear at least 4 (3509, 3494, 3467 and 3448 cm- 1) due to the OH groups. They are well resolved in Tur 1 but less so in Tur 5 and Tur 2. In Tur 4 and then definitively in Tur 3 these components are absent altogether, while appears a new component shifted to higher frequency (3584 cm- 1). Still in Tur 1, Tur 5 and Tur 2 are two bands rather wide low frequency (3300 and 3104 cm- 1) due to the absorption of the molecules of H 2 O. In Tur 4 Tur 3 and these components are not obvious, but seem to be replaced by components centered at different frequencies, due to the presence of H 2 O. For the absorption frequencies in the region of the polyhedra Tur 1, Tur 5, Tur 2, Tur 4 and Tur 3 is observed a gradual decrease of the components that constitute the strong absorption centered around 1100 cm- 1 (due to the vibrations of the groups PO 43 -). Substantial differences can still be seen in the region between 800 and 400 cm- 1 between samples Tur 1, Tur 5, Tur 2 and samples Tur 4 and Tur 3...|$|E
