Two professional actors were paid to appear, and the film is cited as the first film to have used paid actors. The style of shooting and editing would {{bridge the gap between}} the styles of directors Edwin Stanton Porter and D. W. Griffith, and prints have been preserved in both the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E

Howard Spindel, a leading expert on Shield nickels, notes that Shield nickel dies {{produced}} far fewer coins than other coin dies, as the dies <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> so fast that the Mint was continually under great pressure to produce new ones. According to Spindel, many dies were hastily and carelessly produced, producing numerous minor varieties.|$|E

5|$|In May 1943 Albert Speer, the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production, {{informed}} Adolf Hitler of {{work that}} was being carried out to produce a supergun capable of firing hundreds of shells an hour over long distances. The newly designed gun, codenamed the Hochdruckpumpe ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short) and later designated as the V-3, {{was one of the}} V-weapons– Vergeltungswaffen ("retaliation weapons")– developed by Nazi Germany in the later stages of the war to attack Allied targets. Long-range guns were not a new development, but the high-pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous such weapons, including the Paris gun, rapidly <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> their barrels.|$|E
5|$|Mammoths {{continued}} growing during adulthood, as {{do other}} elephants. Males grew until age 40, and females until age 25. Mammoths {{may have had}} gestation periods of 21–22 months, like those of modern elephants. Columbian mammoths had six sets of molars {{in the course of}} a lifetime. At 6–12 months the second set of molars would erupt, with the first set worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for ten years, and this process was repeated until the sixth set emerged at 30 years of age. When the last set of molars <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> the animal would be unable to chew, and would die of starvation.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} two time-shifted density models for <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> failure {{period of a}} single unit system. The study, {{considered}} the time-shifted Gamma and Normal distributions. <b>Wear</b> <b>out</b> failures occur {{as a result of}} deterioration processes or mechanical wear and its probability of occurrence increases with time. A failure rate as a function of time deceases in an early failure period and it increases in <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> period. Failure rates for time shifted distributions and expression for mean time to system are also obtained. Finally, the graphically representation of all the measures of reliability are shown. So we can say from the study that in the <b>wear</b> <b>out</b> period the reliability of the system increases and failure rates of the system decreases...|$|R

Holmes ultimately rebuilt all of the locomotives: other than no. 224, nos. 420/1 were rebuilt in 1887, nos. 422/3 in 1890 and no. 264 in 1893. No. 224 then received its third rebuilding in 1897. In later years, no. 224 was used on secondary and branch line trains.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F <b>wore</b> <b>out,</b> poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E
5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires <b>wore</b> <b>out,</b> cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E
5|$|The Beacon-class gunvessels were a {{class of}} {{composite}} gunboats built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s. They were the first warships of the Royal Navy expressly designed to use the engines of an older class of ships with a different hull shape. They were generally deployed overseas to the China, East Indies, West Africa, Pacific, North America and West Indies Stations. In addition to , the ships fought pirates and suppressed the slave trade in East and West Africa. As their engines <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> in the mid-1880s, they were mostly retired and scrapped {{by the end of}} the decade. A few survived into the early 1900s as they were modified for harbour service before being sold or scrapped.|$|E

5000|$|Signs of strut failure {{include a}} popping or {{clicking}} noise when {{the steering wheel}} of the vehicle is turned, especially when the vehicle is not in motion. This noise {{is caused by a}} <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> bearing. Most strut failure is gradual, and becomes evident as a more [...] "trampoline"-like ride, rough travel over bumps, and tire noise/ vibrations. This wear affects all of the strut components in a feedback loop: the more <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> the shock absorbers become, the more <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> the spring will become, the more <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> the mount will become, and the more this will affect the shock absorbers. A tendency for the front of the vehicle to [...] "nose dive" [...] when applying the brakes and to rear upwards ("squatting") when accelerating are other signs of strut failure, as is difficulty handling the vehicle generally. These symptoms will only tend to worsen until the struts are replaced with new components (struts cannot be repaired when <b>worn</b> <b>out,</b> but must be removed entirely). Many strut [...] "replacements" [...] on non-commercial vehicles are in fact only replacements of the shock absorber and not the other components.|$|R
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{three weeks}} later in China, with the lead-in period to the race marked by Lotus F1 protesting the legality of Mercedes's rear wing design. The FIA rejected the protest, and with Mercedes allowed to continue racing with their car unchanged, Nico Rosberg took his – and the team's – first pole position since their return to Formula One in , while a penalty to Lewis Hamilton for a gearbox change promoted Michael Schumacher to second on the grid. Schumacher would ultimately retire from the race {{after the first round}} of stops when it was discovered that one of his wheels had not been attached properly. Rosberg took an early lead in the race, and while his attempt to complete the race with only two pit stops came under threat from second-placed Jenson Button, a mistake by Button's pit crew during his final stop handed Rosberg a nineteen-second advantage over Kimi Räikkönen. Räikkönen was attempting a similar two-stop strategy, but his tyres <b>wore</b> <b>out</b> seven laps {{from the end of the}} race, and he lost eleven positions in a single lap. This forced Rosberg to drive conservatively to preserve his tyres while Button recovered from his disastrous pit stop to pass Sebastian Vettel for second. Button was held up by the incumbent World Champion long enough for Rosberg to preserve his tyres, and he became the 103rd person to win a Grand Prix. The result was also Mercedes's first win as a constructor since Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. Button was second, with Hamilton scoring his third consecutive third place, giving him a two-point championship lead over Button; Fernando Alonso, who had been leading the championship before the race, finished ninth. After two retirements in the opening rounds of the championship, Romain Grosjean scored his first points in Formula One by finishing sixth.|$|E
