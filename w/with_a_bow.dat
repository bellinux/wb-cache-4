5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan. This time Alambusha, {{as well as}} Iravan, uses {{illusion}} in combat. Alambusha attacks Iravan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow,</b> but Iravan counters, breaking Alambusha's bow and slicing the giant into several pieces. Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself. Then Iravan assumes {{the form of the}} serpent Shesha (Ananta), and his serpent army surrounds him to protect him. Alambusha counters this by assuming the form of Garuda (the eagle-man), the eternal foe of the serpents, and devours the serpent army. Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E
5|$|High {{states that}} {{afterward}} Skaði {{went back up}} to the mountains to Þrymheimr and recites a stanza where Skaði skis around, hunts animals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow,</b> and lives in her fathers old house. Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr as the father of two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E
5|$|The game's 15 {{missions}} {{take place}} in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow</b> or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables {{that may be used}} to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.|$|E

5|$|On August 8, 2011, Rick Riordan {{released}} a video giving {{more information about}} the book and its characters. The video includes pictures of a black haired boy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow</b> and arrow in his hands who is later revealed to be Frank Zhang, a blonde-haired boy holding a teddy bear later revealed as Octavian, a girl with black hair wearing gold armor and a purple cloak sitting on a throne flanked by a gold and a silver canine creature, both with red eyes, who was revealed on Rick Riordan's blog to be Reyna, and another girl riding a horse named Hazel Levesque. Along with this, two chapters were released prior to the book's launch: one was put on Riordan's website and another read out by Riordan on Percy's birthday, August 18.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{infantry}} used in {{the invasion}} was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, {{there was at least}} a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow,</b> 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{military}} {{consisted of}} {{a diverse group of}} men drawn across the various nations of the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in armour and style of fighting. The troops were usually armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow,</b> a 'short spear' and a sword or axe, carried a wicker shield. They wore a leather jerkin, although individuals of high stature wore high quality metal armor. The Persians most likely used their bows to wear down the enemy, then closed in to deliver the final blow with spears and swords. The first rank of Persian infantry formations, the so-called 'sparabara', had no bows, carried larger wicker shields and were sometimes armed with longer spears. Their role was to protect the back ranks of the formation. The cavalry probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.|$|E

5|$|The {{designers}} {{conceived the}} Tallboys as town criers. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role {{was replaced with}} loudspeakers throughout Dunwall. The Tallboy design evolved into a lamplighter that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks, but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow.</b> Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city. For other technologies, designers conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items using modern tools.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Majora's Mask expands on that of Ocarina of Time; it {{retains the}} concept of dungeon puzzles and ocarina songs, and introduces character transformations and a three-day cycle. As in previous installments, Link can perform basic actions such as walking, running and limited jumping, and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles. Link's main weapon is the sword, which can be upgraded throughout the game. Other weapons and items are available—Link can block or reflect attacks with a shield, stun enemies by throwing Deku Nuts, attack from a distance <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow</b> and arrows, and destroy obstacles and damage enemies with bombs. He can also latch onto objects or paralyze enemies with the Hookshot. Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows or spin attacks, {{and the use of}} special items.|$|E
