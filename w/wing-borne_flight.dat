40|$|A {{simulation}} {{of a small}} jet VTOL aircraft {{has been used to}} examine the principles of controlling such aircraft in the partly jet-borne regime. An investigation of three alternative techniques for control at constant speed was made, from which the pilots were able to select a single control technique that was effective from the lowest speed simulated (40 kt) to the highest (150 kt). The preferred technique was to use thrust to control flight path and thrust vector angle to control airspeed while using attitude (controlled by the elevator) to make fine adjustments to both flight path and airspeed. A preliminary study of techniques for performing the transition between <b>wing-borne</b> and jet-borne <b>flight</b> was then made. Although computation limitations precluded transitions to speeds below 40 kt, some valuable information was gained. In particular, a number of transitions were performed successfully, and without great difficulty, while following an I. L. S. beam. As a result of these tests, it is believed that jet VTOL aircraft with adequate stability may have a greater potential than had been anticipated for operating in poor weather, without the complicated flight-director systems and automatic controls that have generally been thought to be necessary...|$|R

50|$|Further {{development}} of the engine then proceeded {{in tandem with the}} aircraft, the Hawker P.1127. The aircraft first flew (tethered hover) on 21 October 1960, powered by the BE53/3 (Pegasus 2). Free hover was achieved on 19 November of the same year. Transition to <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight</b> occurred in 1961. Later versions of the P.1127 were fitted with the Pegasus 3 and eventually the Pegasus 5.|$|E
50|$|The Aerovel Flexrotor {{unmanned}} aerial system (UAS) {{is designed}} for maritime and land-based operations, day and night, and combines endurance and expeditionary capabilities. It needs a 20’ by 20’ area for launch and recovery. Flexrotor takes off and lands vertically (VTOL) and then transitions into horizontal <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight.</b> It flies completely automatically after takeoff, with no pilot intervention needed. Flexrotor quickly assembles for flight, can be rapidly re-stowed in its compact case for storage and transported on a small flatbed truck.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of its loss, the Model 1-G had carried out over 100 flights, accumulating 23 flight hours. Although it never made a {{complete}} transition to and from <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight,</b> tilt angles of 75 degrees were reached during testing, with more than 90% of lift generated by the aircraft's wings. Transcendental received a further contract from the USAF in 1956, which allowed it to design and build a new tiltrotor, the more powerful and aerodynamically refined Transcendental 2, which flew late in 1956. US Government funds were then directed to the Bell XV-3, however, causing the Model 2 to be abandoned with Transcendental being sold to Republic Aviation.|$|E
5000|$|The General Electric X353-5 was an unusual, high bypass ratio, liftfan system {{developed}} for the Ryan XV-5 Vertifan V/STOL research aircraft [...] (known earlier as the VZ-11). Two General Electric J85-5 turbojets were used for propulsion in <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight.</b> During lift, the exhaust from these turbojets was diverted through ducting {{to a pair of}} vertically mounted turbine/fan units buried in the aircraft wings (one in the starboard wing, the other in the port wing). These turbine/fan units were similar in concept to the aft fan units on the General Electric CJ805 -23, the main difference being that the turbine blades of the X353-5 were outboard of the fan, rather than inboard. Each engine supplied half the exhaust gas needed to drive each fan unit. A cross-over duct kept both fans turning uniformly in the event of either engine failing. The aircraft also had a smaller turbine/fan mounted in the aircraft nose, which was used to control pitch. This pitch fan was similar in design to the main fan units and utilised 10.5% of the gas generator exhaust gas flow. Beneath each fan was a series of spanwise exit louvres, ganged together, which were used to vector the fan thrust in lift mode. Effectively, the bypass ratio was 12.16:1 in lift mode.|$|E
50|$|Instead of lift engines {{or using}} a {{direct lift engine}} like the Rolls-Royce Pegasus in the Harrier Jump Jet, the X-35B was powered by the F119-PW-611 which used an {{innovative}} shaft-driven lift fan, patented by Lockheed Martin employee Paul Bevilaqua, and developed by Rolls-Royce. In normal <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight,</b> the F119-PW-611 was configured as a normal reheated turbofan. Somewhat like a turboprop embedded into the fuselage, engine shaft power was diverted forward via a clutch-and-bevel gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located forward of the main engine {{in the center of}} the aircraft. Bypass air from the cruise engine turbofan exhausted through a pair of roll-post nozzles in the wings on either side of the fuselage, while the thrust from the lift fan balanced the thrust of the core stream exhausting through vectored cruise nozzle at the tail. The X-35B powerplant effectively acted as a flow multiplier, much as a turbofan achieves efficiencies by moving unburned air at a lower velocity, and getting the same effect as the Harrier's huge, but supersonically impractical main fan. Like lift engines, this added machinery was dead weight during flight, but the increased lift thrust enhanced take-off payload by even more. The cool fan also reduced the harmful effects of hot, high-velocity air which could harm runway pavement or an aircraft carrier deck. Though risky and complicated, it was made to work to the satisfaction of DoD officials..|$|E

Current VSTOL aircraft suffer from high pilot workload in the hover and transition to full <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight.</b> This arises from poor inherent stability, poor decoupling between what the pilot wishes to control, and inceptor configuration.

In particular, three problem areas are reviewed: (1) the performance losses sustained by a VSTOL aircraft hovering out-of-ground effect, (2) the induced aerodynamic effects encountered as a VSTOL aircraft flies on the combination of powered and aerodynamic lifts between hover and cruise out-of-ground effect, and (3) the aerodynamic characteristics caused by deflected thrust during maneuvering flight over a wide range of both angle of attack and Mach number...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} research {{program has been}} underway at the NASA Langley Research Center to define and develop the technologies required for low-speed flight of high-performance aircraft. This 10 -year program has placed emphasis on both short takeoff and landing (STOL) and short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) operations rather than on regular up and away flight. A series of NASA in-house as well as joint projects have studied various technologies including high lift, vectored thrust, thrust-induced lift, reversed thrust, an alternate method of providing trim and control, and ground effects. These technologies have been investigated {{on a number of}} configurations ranging from industry designs for advanced fighter aircraft to generic wing-canard research models. Test conditions have ranged from hover (or static) through transition to <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight</b> at angles of attack from - 5 to 40 deg at representative thrust coefficients...|$|E
40|$|Available {{prediction}} methods {{applied to}} problems of aero/propulsion interactions for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft are critically reviewed and {{an assessment of}} their strengths and weaknesses provided. The first two problems deal with aerodynamic performance effects during hover: (1) out-of-ground effect, and (2) in-ground effect. The first can be evaluated for some multijet cases; however, the second problem {{is very difficult to}} evaluate for multijets. The ground-environment effects due to wall jets and fountain flows directly affect hover performance. In a related problem: (3) hot-gas ingestion affects the engine operation. Both of these problems as well as jet noise affect the ability of people to work near the aircraft and the ability of the aircraft to operate near the ground. Additional problems are: (4) the power-augmented lift due to jet-flap effects (both in- and out-of-ground effects), and (5) the direct jet-lift effects during short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations. The final problem: (6) is the aerodynamic/propulsion interactions in transition between hover and <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight.</b> Areas where modern CFD methods can provide improvements to current computational capabilities are identified...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a controller for a vertical/shart take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft using the Robust Inverse Dynamic Estimation (RIDE) control theory to improve aircraft performance and reduce pilot workload throughout the transition phase from jet to <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight</b> and vice versa. The controller is required to be effective throughout the speed envelope from hover to 200 knots, during which the aircrafi undergoes significant changes in its dynamics characteristics. The design of the controller is based on a mathematical model of the aircraft linearised at 120 knots, is developed using realistic actuator and sensor models and is extended across the speed range, resulting in the transition envelope controller which is capable of providing acceptable pilot workloads and handling qualities throughout the transition phase. Controller design issues such as the choice of feedback variables, the selection of pilot inceptor configurations and functionalities, and the use of integrator anti-windup techniques in the presence of actuator saturation are discussed. Pilot-in-the-loop simulation studies show that the controller provides good control and handling qualities throughout the transition phase...|$|E
40|$|NASA Ames {{conducted}} a series tests of a large-scale powered model of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works' JSF STOVL configuration at the 80 - by 120 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The model uses {{a modified version}} of an F- 16 fighter engine (a Pratt & Whitney F 100 - 229 engine). To provide vertical flight capability, the Lockheed aircraft incorporates a forward fuselage mounted vertical lift fan in addition to an aft mounted vectoring nozzle all driven by a single engine. The lift fan is driven off the engine by means of a shaft and gear system. The data presented is for STOVL configuration 140, a wing-body-canard planform. The main goal of this testing was to obtain propulsion induced data for evaluating differences between small- and large-scale model testing during the transition flight regime between jet- and <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight.</b> The data presented is from aerodynamic testing of the model in both the unpowered (engine-off) and powered (engine running) configurations.

40|$|Vertical/Short Take-Off arid Landing (V/STOL) fighter {{aircraft}} are characterised by increased control complexity {{caused by the}} extra degree ol freedom. This {{can result in a}} high pilot workload which may be alleviated with the careful application of active flight control. However, the advent of control configured vehicles demands that the controller design must be part of a fully integrated and iterative aircraft design; hence it must allow the two-way flow of design information. In this thesis a suitable controller (leSign method is developed to solve this two-fold problem. The method is based upon a singular perturbation analysis which is used to expose the underlying dynamics of a closed-loop state-space system. developments are described which allow high-order, dynamically complex parasitics, such as actuators, {{to be included in the}} design. urtherrnore, the method gives the designer insight into the problem allowing tuning and engineering trade-offs to be performed intelligently with a two-way flow of design information. The end result is a robust high-gain multivariable controller. In order fully to develop arid analyse the method it has been applied to a representative non-linear time-varying aircraft simulation model. This LS supplied by the Royal Aerospace Establishment, Bedford. The necessary slate-space matrices are otitairted by lirLearisirig the model at several differertt flight cases. This occurs over a wide flight envelope, from hover to 300 Kts, and consequently the multivariable control laws are implemented using gain scheduling. Finally, task tailored control and handling qualities requirements are derived for a V/STOL aircraft in the form of a design brief. This design brief is then fulfilled by designing a controller which alleviates pilot workload during transitions from jet-borne to fully <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight</b> (and vice versa) ...|$|E
40|$|A moving-base {{simulation}} {{has been}} conducted on the Vertical Motion Simulator at Ames Research Center using a model of an advanced, short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) lift fan fighter aircraft. This experiment expanded on investigations during previous simulations with this STOVL configuration {{with the objective of}} evaluating (1) control law modifications over the low speed flight envelope, (2) integration of the throttle inceptor with flight control laws that provide direct thrust command for conventional flight, vertical and short takeoff, and flightpath or vertical velocity command for transition, hover, and vertical landing, (3) control mode blending for pitch, roll, yaw, and flightpath control during transition from wing-borne to jet-borne flight, and (4) effects of conformal versus nonconformal presentation of flightpath and pursuit guidance symbology on the out-the-window display for low speed STOVL operations. Assessments were made for takeoff, transition, hover, and landing, including precision hover and landing aboard an LPH-type amphibious assault ship in the presence of winds and rough seas. Results yielded Level 1 pilot ratings for the flightpath and vertical velocity command modes for a range of land-based and shipboard operation and were consistent with previous experience with earlier control laws and displays for this STOVL concept. Control mode blending was performed over speed ranges in accord with the pilot's tasks and with the change of the basic aircraft's characteristics between wing-borne and hover flight. Blending of yaw control from heading command in hover to sideslip command in <b>wing-borne</b> <b>flight</b> performed over a broad speed range helped reduce yaw transients during acceleration through the low speed regime. Although the pilots appreciated conformality of flightpath and guidance symbols with the external scene during the approach, increased sensitivity of the symbols for lateral path tracking elevated the pilots' control activity in the presence of turbulence. The pilots preferred the choice of scaling that was originally established during the display development and in-flight evaluations...|$|E
