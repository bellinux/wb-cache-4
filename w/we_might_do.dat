500|$|In {{separate}} interviews {{early in}} 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, [...] "There's {{nothing in the}} pipeline yet, but... we'll see. It's possible." [...] Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans. [...] In October that year, Dave Davies quashed rumours of a reunion, stating {{in an interview that}} although he loves his brother, [...] "I just can't stand to be with him. About an hour with Ray's my limit, so {{it would be a very}} short reunion." [...] In November of that year Ray Davies reported that he had recently recorded with Avory [...] "just to sort of try to do what we call demos... <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> it in fits and starts and bring Dave in at a later date. I'll never say never with my brother, because he's totally unpredictable." [...] In a 2013 Skype interview Dave Davies expressed interest in doing reunions shows. On 18 December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave Davies onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London to perform [...] "You Really Got Me". On 5 November 2016, Dave Davies posted on Twitter: [...] "Me and Ray have not spoken about Kinks shows at all– although were trying to work together on other stuff and have worked on music together".|$|E
500|$|Co-director Johnson {{would go}} over each {{scene with the}} animators, {{sometimes}} acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a [...] "dope sheet"—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key [...] "hits". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on [...] "2s" [...] or [...] "4s" [...] (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: [...] "The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in {{and see how it}} played in the reel and fine-tune from there. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot." [...] The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of [...] "data wranglers." [...] Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a [...] "color cube." [...] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: [...] "The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it." [...] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why didn't you lend me {{your own}} cool head and clear brain," [...] {{retorted}} the other, [...] "and then <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have <b>done</b> {{something of the}} sort? But surely the shot I gave him must tell in the long-run." ...|$|R

2500|$|Perrow {{concluded}} that the failure at Three Mile Island was {{a consequence of the}} system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking on the {{possibility}} of more sting operations, Lt. Matthew Stapleton of the Petaluma, California Police Department said: [...] "f we have the resources in the future, absolutely, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> one. ... I don't think we would do a Dateline sting again, but we established a partnership with Perverted Justice, so they could help us, if necessary." [...] He also commented, [...] "Perverted Justice did everything, as promised. They were a perfect partner." ...|$|E
2500|$|After he left office, Clifford, in the July 1969 {{issue of}} Foreign Affairs, made his views very clear: [...] "Nothing <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> {{could be so}} beneficial... as to begin to {{withdraw}} our combat troops. Moreover... we cannot realistically expect to achieve anything more through our military force, and {{the time has come}} to begin to disengage. That was my final conclusion as I left the Pentagon..." [...] Clifford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction, from Johnson on the President's last day in office, January 20, 1969.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 June 2016, USAF {{spokesman}} Maj. Rob Leese confirmed that, {{while the}} Air Force's KC-46 contract with Boeing {{does not contain}} any pre-defined penalties for schedule delays. Not delivering the 18 certified tankers by August 2017 is a contract schedule breach. [...] "The Air Force will secure consideration from Boeing {{as part of the}} schedule re-baseline that is about to commence following the RRA delay announcement." [...] On 12 July 2016, Frank Kendall, US Defense Acquisitions Chief, confirmed that the tanker program office was analyzing the likely costs for the service arising from the delay. [...] "The government is losing some of the value that we have contracted for, so we are entitled to some consideration for that. The program office has several ideas for how <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> that, and they’re talking to Boeing." [...] The USAF would incur additional costs were it necessary to operate the KC-135 fleet for longer than planned.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{dramatic}} {{failure of the}} first United States attempt to launch a satellite on December 6, 1957, Sides spoke at a conference of the American Management Association on January 15, 1958, where he reiterated that the nation's development of long-range missiles was [...] "progressing very well" [...] and complained that a false impression had been created by missiles that failed in early tests. [...] "It just so happened that {{about the time of}} the sputnik launchings, our intermediate and intercontinental ballistics missile flight-test programs were getting into high gear; and not being blessed with a Siberian proving ground, where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> our testing in private, every malfunctioning test vehicle was given a play in all the media of public information. The impression was unwittingly created that we were really on our uppers, when, as a matter of fact, each one of these so-called unsuccessful missiles yielded {{a great deal of the}} very information it was fired to obtain. In ten years of missile experience I cannot recall a missile system in which similar casualties were not encountered in the early test flights. But in each case we have determined the causes, corrected the deficiencies and gone on to develop a successful weapon system." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twisted Pixel wanted Captain Smiley and Star to {{be unique}} in each {{different}} comic iteration. [...] To do so the developers created four unique sets of models for Captain Smiley and Star, and also created unique animations and weaponry for each iteration. When {{the game was}} compared to Comix Zone, Whitford responded that inspiration was drawn from it, but that transitions between comic panels and turning of pages were to [...] "savor the moment", adding that the premise of transitions {{was to create a}} cinematic transition. Twisted Pixel combined live action video along with the existing gameplay to further the feel of the game being read as a comic book. As with previous Twisted Pixel games avatar awards and premium themes can be unlocked through gameplay. [...] As part of promoting the game Twisted Pixel released Comic Jumper T-shirts and posters as well as a Captain Smiley maquette for purchase. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} Comic Jumper comic book series, Whitford responded [...] "we've thought about that", adding [...] "it's definitely a cool idea, and something <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>do</b> later [...] but we'll have to see." [...] In an interview given during an Evil Avatar podcast, Josh Bear revealed that there would not be any downloadable content for Comic Jumper. [...] Bear later explained that this was due to the complexity of the game's levels. [...] Twisted Pixel released the game's soundtrack to the public via their website on November 3, 2010.|$|E
