5|$|Apart from engine No 1 of 1848 {{being named}} Dragon only two other NSR engines <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> named, in 1882 Class C 2-4-0 No. 55 was named Colin Minton Campbell and Class C No. 54 John Bramley Moore after the {{chairman}} and deputy chairman of the company, respectively.|$|E
5|$|At the 1939 National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, {{plans were}} set into action to make Kappa Kappa Psi an {{international}} fraternity.

5|$|Colonel Ezaki {{reported}} the American attack on Papitalai Mission to the Eighth Area Army in Rabaul, promising a night counterattack on the position; but no attack was delivered. The Japanese withdrew, and no further messages <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> received from Colonel Ezaki.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, {{underwater}} searches {{were conducted}} by Aruban authorities after an American couple {{reported that they were}} snorkeling when they photographed what they thought might be human skeletal remains, possibly those of Holloway. Aruban authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> recovered.|$|E
5|$|Only a small {{fraction}} of reparations <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> paid. In fact, the historian Stephen Schuker demonstrates in American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919–33, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German outpayments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two people}} <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> {{degraded}} – Lord Cochrane in 1813 and General Sir Eyre Coote in 1816, both for political reasons, {{rather than any}} of the grounds given in the statute. Lord Cochrane was subsequently reinstated, but Coote died a few years after his degradation.|$|E

5|$|Tetrarchs {{did not see}} {{any further}} combat and were deemed {{obsolete}} by 1946; the last was retired in 1950. There were several variations on the Tetrarch design, including the Alecto self-propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII, {{but none of these}} <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> used in active service with the British Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} establishment {{also included}} supply units. However, only the 59th Waffen Gebirgsjäger Regiment, one battalion of the 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment, one {{company of the}} 24th SS Pioneer Battalion and a half-company of the divisional panzer company <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> established.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, none {{of these}} designs <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> built, much like other late-war German warship designs, such as the L 20 α-type battleships and the s. The German {{shipbuilding}} effort largely abandoned surface warship construction and instead focused on U-boat construction in {{the final years of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 11 {{companies}} <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the model, {{a maximum of}} 3 at any given time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, {{if for no other}} reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history. Audible differences could result from the mounting screws, grille fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War in September, {{construction}} continued desultorily until October when it was suspended by the Admiralty for one year to release labour and material for escorts needed to protect merchant convoys. Construction of the 16-inch guns and their turrets was to continue, however. The question was raised again on 12 November 1940 and the decision to suspend construction was reaffirmed. All three ships ordered were cancelled in 1942, but Lions keel was not scrapped until {{after the end of the}} war. Only four 16-inch guns, and no turrets, <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> completed.|$|E

5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> {{built by}} the U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E
5|$|Although none <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow {{were also}} proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
5|$|Cornfoot's {{murder was}} {{investigated}} {{by members of}} the aristocracy appointed by the Privy Council two weeks after the killing. Subsequently four men were held in custody and charges were to be brought against the burgh bailie. The release of the four accused men was authorised by Patrick Cowper, the local minister, who had been involved with the initial witchcraft allegations and the torture and confinement of the alleged witches. Despite instructions from the Privy Council that another committee should look into the events, no suspects <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> prosecuted for the murder.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{designed}} {{before a}} low radar cross-section (RCS) and other stealth factors <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> a consideration, a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical note of 1957 stated {{that of all}} the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: only one or two components contributed significantly to the echo at any aspect, compared with three or more on most other types.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Army Air Corps {{found the}} {{performance}} of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre-production aircraft, to be designated YB-21. However, soon after this contract was awarded, it was cancelled, and none of the YB-21s <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> built, leaving the XB-21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed. Operated by North American Aviation, the XB-21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements <b>were</b> <b>ever</b> needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
