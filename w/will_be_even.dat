In the epilogue, T-Rick is recovered alive following the explosion, Thomas is convicted for disturbing the peace, contributing to the delinquency of minors, and inciting a riot, and Costa and J.B. are acquitted; Costa because of his expensive lawyer and J.B. because his parents convince the court that he is mentally incapable and unfit to stand trial.

In an interview with Jillian Reynolds, Costa promises his next party <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> better.|$|E
500|$|Sam Huff, a linebacker, was {{inducted}} in 1982. Originally a third round selection by the New York Giants in the 1956 NFL Draft, Huff {{played for the}} Giants from 1956–1963 and later for the Washington Redskins from 1964–1969. Huff's football career, let alone his future in the NFL, [...] almost never came to pass, however. [...] As a junior in high school, WVU head coach Art Lewis came to Huff's town to look at another prospect. Luckily for Huff (and for the Mountaineers), Lewis wound up recruiting Sam instead. Fate intervened once more for Huff {{at the end of}} his collegiate career, as Giants scout Al DeRogatis came to Morgantown to look at All-American guard Bruce Bosley. DeRogatis instead discovered Huff, proclaiming that [...] "there's another guard here who <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> greater. His name is Sam Huff." [...] Huff became a five-time Pro Bowl selection, a four-time First-Team All-Pro selection, an inductee in the NFL 1950s All-Decade Team, and was named as one of the 70 Greatest Redskins of all-time. Huff was also recognized as the NFL's Top Linebacker in 1959.|$|E

At the time, The Original Series was being broadcast on 137 stations in the United States in syndication, and it was expected that the new television service would provide a single evening package which could be broadcast by these independent stations as well as Paramount's recently acquired Hughes Television Network. It was hoped that this station could become the fourth national network in the United States; Diller and his assistant Michael Eisner had hired Jeffrey Katzenberg to manage Star Trek into production, with a television film due to launch the new series at a cost of $3.2 million – which would have been the most expensive television movie ever made.|$|E
