5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided <b>We</b> <b>Stand</b> {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E

60|$|Very quietly I {{thrust the}} door open, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> there upon the threshold--Cavalcanti and I--father and lover of that sweet maid {{who was the}} prey of this foul Duke. <b>We</b> <b>stood</b> whilst a man might count a dozen, silent {{witnesses}} of that loathsome scene.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught the}} hand in his, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> in that connexion, {{looking at each}} other. <b>We</b> <b>stood</b> so, a long time; long {{enough for me to}} see the white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek, and leave it a deeper red.|$|R

60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> {{and stared at}} each other, and strange {{spectacles}} we were.|$|R

25|$|I've {{heard it}} {{said of the}} NDP that we are too {{attached}} to the past, but I {{tell you that it}} is our political opponents who are the Jurassic Park of Canadian politics.

25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United <b>We</b> <b>Stand</b> America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
25|$|We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans or kilts are Scottish. So <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at in the right way. At one extreme, QI is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato.|$|E
