40|$|The Australian Registry of Antiepileptic Drug Use in Pregnancy {{includes}} 172 {{instances in}} which women took sodium valproate, with or <b>without</b> other antiepileptic <b>drugs,</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> These pregnancies resulted in a substantially higher (p < 0. 05) rate of malformed offspring (15. 1 %) compared with 348 pregnant women who took antiepileptic drugs other than valproate (2. 3 %) and 40 pregnancies in epileptic women who took no antiepileptic drugs (2. 5 %). At valproate doses of 1400 mg and below per day, the mean rate of pregnancies with fetal malformations was 6. 42 % and {{did not seem to}} be dose-dependent. At higher valproate doses, the mean rate of pregnancy with fetal malformation was 33. 9 % and appeared to increase with increasing drug dosage. This finding suggests the need for reappraisal of the use of valproate in women who may become pregnant or are pregnant whilst the drug is taken. The therapeutic policy adopted may depend on whether valproate doses below 1400 mg per day are regarded as safe for the fetus. This study indicates that the risk of malformation associated with such doses was just statistically significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than that associated with other antiepileptic drugs. Various possible clinical scenarios are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{illness in}} {{pregnant}} women is common. In epilepsy, bipolar disorder (BD) or {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD), pharmacotherapy is often necessary. Some neurotropic drugs may have negative effects on children exposed in utero. The aim of this thesis was to describe how neurotropic drugs and/or maternal chronic illness <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may influence {{the health of the}} child, both in the neonatal period and long-term outcome, with emphasis on neurodevelopment. In study I, we investigated school results at age 16 in children born to women with epilepsy (WWE), with or <b>without</b> antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> (AED) <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Study II and study III aimed at describing neonatal morbidity in infants prenatally exposed to antidepressant drugs. In study IV we studied neonatal and long-term outcome of children born to mothers with severe mood disorders, mostly BD. Methods: In study I, national health care and education registers as well as maternal care records were used to compare final grades of children of WWE {{with the rest of the}} population. Study II was a retrospective, hospital-based study of patient records of women treated with antidepressants in late pregnancy and their children. Information on neonatal diagnoses, maternal use of antidepressant drugs and scoring according to Neonatal Abstinence Score (NAS) was used. In study III, we used the Medical Birth Register, the Prescribed Drug Register and two neonatal quality registers to obtain data on maternal use of antidepressants, maternal health and infant morbidity (diagnoses, admission to neonatal care unit (NCU) and interventions). In study IV, information on maternal health <b>during</b> and after <b>pregnancy</b> was obtained from patient records and at a structured interview. At age 4 to 5 years, the children were assessed by a psychologist with a cognitive test (WPPSI-III). Results: In study I, we observed an increased risk of not receiving a final grade from compulsory school for children exposed to ≥ 2 AED <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2. 99 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 14 – 4. 17), but no increased risk for children born to mothers with untreated epilepsy or exposed to AED in monotherapy. In study II, 22 % of 205 infants assessed with NAS had signs of mild neonatal abstinence and 3 % of severe abstinence. Among a total of 741 040 infants included in study III, 22 507 (3 %) were exposed to antidepressants <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Thirteen percent of exposed infants were admitted to NCU compared to 8 % in the population, adjusted OR 1. 5 (95 % CI 1. 4 - 1. 6). Respiratory disorders, persistent pulmonary hypertension and hypoglycemia were more common after maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In study IV, there were no statistically significant differences in IQ between children born to women with mood disorders with lithium use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (n= 20), children born to mothers with mood disorders but no lithium use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (n= 8) and children born to mothers with no mood disorders (n= 11). Conclusions: Neurotropic <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> can be associated to adverse outcomes in exposed children. Infants exposed to antidepressants have a moderately increased risk of being admitted to NCU. AED polytherapy <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may be associated to a worsened neurodevelopmental outcome but a causal connection is not established. Lithium exposure <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> was not associated to adverse cognitive outcome at preschool age in our cohort...|$|R

Objectives: To assess the association {{between the use of}} acid-suppressive <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and the risk of developing childhood asthma using a bidirectional case-crossover design. Methods: Mother-infant matched sets in the United Kingdom General Practitioners Research Database were used to identify children with a drug-treated asthma diagnosis during the years 2006 - 2010 who were matched to a sibling without asthma as controls. Primary exposure was use of any anti-suppressive <b>drug</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> and subgroup analyses were conducted according to drug class (e. g., proton-pump inhibitors or H 2 -receptor antagonists), trimester and mother's age. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios with their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of 1, 874 children with asthma and 1, 874 control siblings were included in the analysis. The exposure rate among case and control pregnancies was 22 % and 20 % respectively. After adjustments for gender, birth order, mother's age and GP visits, the exposure to any gastricacid suppressive <b>drug</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> slightly increased the risk for developing asthma (OR 1. 23; 95 % CI: 1. 01 to 1. 51, p-value 0. 042).

Prescription opioids, along with antianxiety and antidepressant medications are of special concern, both for their prevalence and for the potential risks associated with using these <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate prescription <b>drug</b> use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi, with a focus on opioids and antianxiety and antidepressant medications. The first of three studies sought to determine the prevalence of prescription opioid <b>drug</b> use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi, describe differences in prescription opioid <b>drug</b> use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in Hawaiʻi by maternal demographic characteristics, and investigate possible predictors of prescription opioid <b>drug</b> use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> through the use of multivariable logistic regression.

40|$|Introduction Health care professionals' {{perception}} of risk mayimpact on therapeutic management of women <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Since the thalidomide tragedy, the use of <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> pregnancygenerates fear. This concern might affect the estimation of the riskassociated with <b>drug</b> intake <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> leading to prematurediscontinuation of a required treatment, superfluous anxiety orpointless termination of a desired pregnancy. Although data regardingthe security of <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> are still scarce, a few specializedinformation sources exist providing reliable recommendationsfor daily practice. This study aimed at characterizing therisk perception associated with <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in a sample ofSwiss health care professionals. Materials & Methods An online French and German survey was sentby email to the Swiss professional societies of Pharmacists, Gynecologists,Mid-wives and Pediatricians. The questionnaire wasconstructed to assess (a) {{the characteristics of the}} population and theopinion of the professionals regarding the medication use pattern intheir pregnant patients, (b) to evaluate the sources of information usedduring their practice and finally (c) to assess their risk perceptionassociated with <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Results were analyzed bydescriptive statistics. Results A total of 1, 310 questionnaires were collected (18 % responserate). Most health care professionals believe that 30 - 60 % of theirpregnant patients are taking at least one treatment during their pregnancyand that 80 % are adherent to it. A large majority think,however, that women are anxious when they must take their medication. More than 80 % of health professionals commonly use theSwiss Drug Reference Book (Compendium) to assess the risk associatedwith <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> despite the uniformly low levelof credibility and utility they express about this reference. Except forsome gynecologists, the majority of professionals are not aware of ordo not use specialized books. The majority of participants thinkwrongly that more than 30 % of drugs are teratogenic. About 20 % ofthem are not aware of the risk associated with paracetamol intakeduring pregnancy. More than 70 % agree that phytotherapeutic mixturesare not safer than conventional drugs, with the exception of midwiveswho tend to overestimate the safety of such drugs. With thenotable exception of gynecologists, the risk related to drug intake wasoverall overestimated. Discussion & Conclusion Swiss professionals differ in their perceptionof the risk associated with <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and tend tooverestimate it. The differences might be attributed to the level oftraining and awareness of specialized sources offering a realisticestimation of the risk.

METHODS: This population-based study included mothers who delivered live-born infants without birth defects between 1997 and 2004 and completed interviews for the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (response rate 69 %; n= 5871). Prevalence of self-reported illicit drug use (specifically cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants) <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and its associations with demographic and social factors were assessed. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses to study the associations of cannabis use with birth weight and gestational age. RESULTS: The prevalence of reported illicit <b>drug</b> use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> was 3. 6 % (standard error 0. 24). Pregnant users of cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants were younger, had {{a lower level of}} education and lower household income, and were less likely to have used folic acid in the periconceptional period than nonusers.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has provided inconclusive evidence regarding the neuropsychological difficulties of {{children born to}} mothers partaking in opioid or poly-drug use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Little is known about how these children fare as they get older. The present longitudinal study includes follow-up data on 45 children born to mothers who used heroin and poly-drugs {{and a group of}} 48 children <b>without</b> prenatal <b>drug</b> exposure. Most of the drug-exposed youths were placed in permanent foster or adoptive homes before one year of age. The youths (ages 17 to 21) were administered 10 neuropsychological tests. The drug-exposed youths had cognitive and fine motor functions within the normal range compared to population norms but performed significantly worse than the non-exposed group. There were indications of generally lower cognitive functions rather than specific problems with executive functioning. Lower mean birthweight in the risk group (619 grams mean difference, p <. 001) only partially mediated the group differences in cognitive functioning. There was a tendency for youths who had few and early changes in their caregivers or who were born to mothers who had used the least number of different <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> to have the best cognitive scores. The study indicates that youths born to mothers who used multiple <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> are vulnerable relative to their peers within a wide range of cognitive functions. The vulnerability seems to be related not only to the mother’s <b>drug</b> use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> but also to factors such as birthweight and unstable parental care during infancy...|$|R

50|$|Scleroderma in {{pregnancy}} {{is a complex}} situation; it increases the risk to both mother and child. Overall scleroderma is associated with reduced fetal weight for gestational age. The treatment for scleroderma often includes known teratogens such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mycophenolate, etc. and hence careful avoidance of such <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is advised. In these cases hydroxychloroquine and low-dose corticosteroids might be used for disease control.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In pregnancy, {{the mother}} and fetus share body {{structures}} based on the maternal organism. Exposure to psychoactive drugs in this period may have repercussions on the baby's hearing. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} investigate this association. Aim Analyze the results of newborn hearing screening (NHS), the occurrence of associated risk factors, and the incidence of hearing loss in newborn exposed to psychoactive <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Methods This is an observational retrospective study done from a database analysis. From this database, records were selected about the use of psychoactive <b>drugs</b> by mothers <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> then the neonates were divide into two groups: the study group (146 babies exposed to drugs) and the control group (500 babies not exposed to drugs). The NHS failure rate, the presence of risk factors for hearing loss, and need for audiological diagnosis were analyzed in both groups. From these variables, absolute frequency and prevalence rates were calculated and the results compared between groups. Results There was no statistically significant difference in the comparison of NHS failure rates between the groups (p[*]=[*] 0. 267). The occurrence of risk factors for hearing loss was greater in babies exposed to drugs (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). There was only one diagnosis of hearing loss, which occurred in the control group (p[*]=[*] 0. 667). Conclusion The use of psychoactive <b>drugs</b> by mothers <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> did not affect the NHS failure rate of this sample. However, the occurrence of significant risk factors in the study group showed a possible sensitivity of babies exposed to psychoactive <b>drugs</b> <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy...</b>|$|R
