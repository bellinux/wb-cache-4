60|$|I was a {{good deal}} excited, and a little {{fatigued}} with the walk and the incidents of the morning, and determined to proceed at once to Duke Street, and share the cold dinner of my aunt; for few private families in York, that depended on regular cooks for their food, had anything served warm on their tables, for that and the two succeeding days. Here and there a <b>white</b> <b>substitute</b> was found, it is true, and we had the benefit of such an assistant at half-past one. It was the English servant of a Col. Mosely, an officer of the army, who was intimate at my uncle's, and who had had the civility to offer a man for this occasion. I afterwards ascertained, that many officers manifested the same kind spirit towards various other families in which they visited on terms of friendship.|$|E

40|$|Millions {{of people}} all over the world are granted better vision thanks to a {{seemingly}} magic molecule. The molecule makes it possible to remove the eye’s lens and replace it with an artificial one. Cataracts are the cause of most lens replacements. The disease clouds the lens which in turn blurs vision. Until the early 1980 ’s, lens transplants were a very complicated affair, so much so that many eye surgeons avoided the procedure altogether. The revolutionary events that have taken place since, now allow surgeons to perform a lens transplant in less than 15 minutes, the results of which are successful nearly every single time. This medical breakthrough was made possible by the magic molecule described in this book. The same molecule has also helped to ease ailing knees affected by arthritis. Despite the controversial nature of the molecule’s use in treating arthritis, the fact remains that many of the millions of people treated yearly report significant relief as a result. Furthermore, the molecule’s use in treating joints is not limited to those of humans, but also includes horses. Then working as product manager for the Swedish pharmaceutical company Pharmacia, I was personally involved in introducing Healonid® Vet., a product based on the magic molecule, into the French equestrian market some forty years ago. As if eyes, knees and horses were not enough, the magic molecule has even revolutionized the global beauty industry during the past twenty years. Commonly used as the main ingredient in dermal fillers, the molecule has enabled many of the most successful wrinkle reducing products developed by world leading companies. The magic molecule I speak of is a sugar molecule called hyaluronic acid. The modern term for the molecule is hyaluronan, often shortened HA. For the purposes of this book, the term hyaluronic acid will be used, since this is still the term most frequently used. Hyaluronic acid is found in a number of areas within the human body. In the human skin, hyaluronic acid works as a moisturizing and filling agent. In the human joint it acts as a lubricant and shock absorber. It is also found in the eye and the umbilical cord. Hyaluronic acid is also found in sources outside the human body. The hyaluronic acid described in this book originates from rooster combs or synthetically, through a process of bacterial fermentation. Hyaluronic acid was discovered in 1934 by Karl Meyer and John Palmer, researchers at Columbia University. A Hungarian researcher by the name of Endre Balazs was the first to develop hyaluronic acid for commercial use. In 1943, Balazs received a patent for a method using fluid from knee joints of cows to be used as an egg <b>white</b> <b>substitute</b> in baking. The product itself was not very successful, but Balazs was inspired to search for other commercial uses for hyaluronic acid. In particular, he was eager to discover medical benefits of its use. Endre Balazs is still driven by this eagerness, at 95 years of age. Throughout his career, he has successfully transformed research into practical benefit to an extent that most researchers only dream of...|$|E

30|$|Because Southern {{immigrants}} were disproportionately black {{relative to the}} native labor force, segmentation between the markets for black and white labor in the North would have concentrated the effects of immigration on blacks. A simple measure of the separation between these markets is the correlation {{between black and white}} employment shares within industry-occupation cells throughout the North. This correlation, which does not reflect segregation at lower levels of aggregation, was. 65 in 1940 and. 41 in 1950. In the next section, I provide direct evidence of imperfect substitution: treating the entire North as an aggregate labor market, I estimate a finite elasticity of substitution between blacks and whites. The wage regressions, employment share correlations and structural elasticity estimates imply that black and white labor were utilized as though they were imperfectly substitutable, though this effective imperfect substitution may not have been due to actual productivity differences. Discrimination against blacks, for example, may have caused occupational segregation that prevented the substitution of black for white labor. Racial differences in educational attainment, and educational quality conditional on attainment, may have also rendered blacks and <b>whites</b> imperfect <b>substitutes.</b> Boustan (2009) finds that controlling for measures of educational quality can explain two thirds of the apparent imperfect substitution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the mid-twentieth century, {{relative}} black {{wage growth}} in the North lagged behind the Jim Crow South. Inter-regional migration may explain this trend. Four million black southerners moved North from 1940 to 1970, more than doubling the northern black population. Black migrants will exert more competitive pressure on black wages if blacks and <b>whites</b> are imperfect <b>substitutes.</b> I use variation in the relative black-white migrant flows across skill groups to estimate the elasticity of substitution by race in the northern economy. I then calculate a counterfactual rate of black-white wage convergence in the North {{in the absence of}} southern migration. Migration slowed the pace of northern convergence by 50 percent, more than accounting for the regional gap. Ongoing migration appears to have been an impediment to black economic assimilation in the urban North...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Under normal sealing {{and storage}} conditions, Nylon- 6, poly-caprolactam-based plastic {{laminates}} may release impurities to packaged foods and liquids {{and the application}} of heat for cooking often increases the rate of migration. Epsilon-caprolactam {{is one of the main}} contaminates found to migrate from a Nylon- 6 poly-caprolactam plastic film. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of solvent, transportation and storage time on the migration of ε-caprolactam from a Nylon- 6 -based lidding material into water or a <b>white</b> wine <b>substitute</b> (12 % ethanol). Polypropylene plastic cups were filled, sealed, packaged, stacked and exposed to a simulated 3 -day cross-country shipment. Cups were sampled with or without simulated shipment after 0, 7, 14 and 28 days at 20. 6 °C. Epsilon-caprolactam was determined using a GC equipped with FID and a Restek Rtx 1301 megabore column. Results of the study indicated migration of ε-caprolactam into containers at the time of sealing with significantly higher levels (4. 42 ppm average) occurring in cups containing 12 % ethanol vs. water (0. 01 ppm average). After the cups were sealed, neither simulated cross-country shipment nor storage increased levels of ε-caprolactam in either solvent. The results indicate that wine sealed in packages lined with Nylon- 6 -based plastic could contain significant amounts of ε-caprolactam. However, it is not understood how the alcohol, whether as liquid or vapor, interacted with the lidding material to increase migration at the time of sealing. No delamination of the polypropylene layer in the lidding material was observed after sealing. Future research needs to be conducted to study the effects of alcohol, alcohol vapor, sealing time and temperature on ε-caprolactam migration...|$|R
