40|$|Two {{pieces of}} wool fabric sewn {{together}} in several places. One is more faded than the other. In some areas, {{the edge of}} the fragment has been turned under. The two pieces may be originally from the same fabric. Both have remnants of red countered weft twining with loops passing over 2 or three warps. Because the twining yarns are so fragmented, the structure is obscured.; Several holes and tears. Uneven fading. Much of the red weft twining is missing. Occasional <b>weft</b> <b>picks</b> missing or very loose, also. The wool still retains some luster...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of undyed woven linen fabric with {{a single}} red wool weft near an edge with a long fringe (but {{no sign of a}} border). There are two pairs of {{multiple}} <b>weft</b> <b>picks.</b> A very small (0. 8 cm x 3. 5 cm) piece of woven wool fabric has adhered to the surface. There is a remnant of a plain selvedge.; Dirty and worn. There are several pinholes and large edge tears. Some edge fraying. The edge next to the red wool weft has a long fringe which may be due to wear as there are no knots visible...|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} {{fragments of}} woven wool {{that have been}} sewed together.; Fragment A - medium brown warp and weft; Fragment B - slightly darker brown warp and weft, attached {{at right angles to}} C and D.; Fragment C - dark brown warp and weft and three <b>weft</b> <b>picks</b> of blue/purple at one edge; Fragment D - brown/gold warp and yellowed weft with small remnants of green/blue weft.; Dirty and very worn.

Weft damage to fragment B leaves exposed warps...|$|R
40|$|Long, {{narrow strip}} of wool fabric which {{includes}} a selvedge and a very small fragment of a dark blue/purple tapestry band which does not extend {{to the edge of}} the fabric. Two small groups of linen wefts form a decorative section at one end of the purple band. Each section of linen covers three warp yarns and approximately 8 <b>weft</b> <b>picks.</b> Each section is completely separate from the other. Two other very tiny bits of linen yarn occur 2. 8 cm and 3. 4 cm from the woven linen sections. They could indicate tapestry patterning in the blue/purple section. There are several sewing stitches.; Dirty and worn. A tear occurs along the selvedge in one spot. Edges other than the selvedge are frayed...|$|R
5000|$|Different {{types of}} looms {{are most often}} defined by {{the way that the}} <b>weft,</b> or <b>pick,</b> is {{inserted}} into the warp. Many advances in weft insertion have been made in order to make manufactured cloth more cost effective. There are five main types of weft insertion and they are as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|In textile terminology, threads {{that run}} {{the length of}} the fabric (longitudinally) are warp ends. Threads running {{laterally}} from edge to edge, that is from left side to right side of the fabric as it emerges from the loom, are <b>weft</b> <b>picks.</b> Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process. The weave used to construct the selvage may be the same or different from the weave of the body of the fabric cloth. Most selvages are narrow, but some may be as wide as [...]75 in. Descriptions woven into the selvage using special jacquards, colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes. For many end-uses the selvage is discarded. Selvages are 'finished' and will not fray because the weft threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the warp.|$|R
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of woven wool fabric with brown {{warp and weft}} and a divided weft band 1 cm from one edge. Total width is 0. 9 cm. One purple section is 0. 3 cm wide (16 picks), the other is 0. 4 cm wide (16 picks) with 0. 2 cm of brown <b>weft</b> (8 <b>picks)</b> between.; Somewhat dirty and worn. Some edge wefts are loose and thinned. There is some weft edge fraying...|$|R
40|$|Large {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric with purple bands at each end. At one end, {{the band is}} approximately 1. 1 cm wide. At the opposite end, there there is a divided band with 6 picks of yellow between the two stripes. One stripe is 1 cm wide, the other is 0. 9 cm. There are two, possibly, selvedge remnants. One is in the yellow wool only and is in two pieces totaling 18. 5 cm long. The fabric, at one point is wider than this selvedge, so {{it may have been}} part of a neckline of a tunic. The other selvedge (or edge of slit tapestry) is only {{at the edge of the}} double purple band. It is the opposite edge from the other selvedge. This one may be a selvedge because of the extra weft passes. The center yellow wefts also encircle the outside warp, as well as two <b>weft</b> <b>picks</b> above the purple bands. There is a remnant of a weft twining row at one end of the yellow selvedge. The twining loops pass over two warps. Uneven spinning.; Somewhat dirty and very worn. Many small interior holes. Several edge tears. Some areas of damaged or missing wefts leave exposed warps. Edges are frayed...|$|R

40|$|Small, uneven wool {{fragment}} with weft stripes {{in three}} colors. Warp yarns are brown; weft yarns {{at one side}} are the same brown as the warp (1. 5 cm wide); weft {{for the bulk of}} the fragment is dark greenish blue (7. 5 cm wide); opposite side of fabric from brown <b>wefts</b> are three <b>picks</b> of red <b>weft</b> in the same shed.; Dirty and frayed at the edges...|$|R
40|$|Large {{fragment}} of brown woven wool fabric with four purple tapestry bands. These bands {{do not go}} {{all the way across the}} weft. They are all approximately 11 cm long by 0. 7 cm wide. The bands stop approximately 5. 5 cm from the selvedge edge of the fabric. Above the bands there is a pinstripe that consists of alternating picks of white and purple <b>weft</b> (2 <b>picks</b> of each) to form tiny verticle stripes. 1. 7 cm from this pinstripe there is a 1. 5 cm long section of border. The remainder of this edge is torn and frayed.; Some localized dirt, otherwise fairly clean but worn. Several small interior holes and large edge tears. Parts of the fabric are very fragmented. Edges frayed...|$|R
50|$|The Jacquard loom is a {{mechanical}} loom, invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1801, which simplifies {{the process of}} manufacturing textiles with complex patterns such as brocade, damask and matelasse. The loom is controlled by punched cards with punched holes, each row of which corresponds to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose {{the design of the}} textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740) To call it a loom is a misnomer, a Jacquard head could be attached to a power loom or a hand loom, the head controlling which warp thread was raised during shedding. Multiple shuttles could be used to control the colour of the <b>weft</b> during <b>picking.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with a 0. 4 cm wide (8 <b>picks)</b> <b>weft</b> band {{near the}} center. There are three rows of weft-twining present; 1 cm from the purple band, 0. 7 cm {{on the other}} side of the purple band, 6. 5 cm from the second twining row.

Fragment C is especially dirty. Fragment A has large and small interior holes and edge tears and thinned wefts. Fragment B has an interior hole and a long edge tear. Fragment C has an edge tear. Some weft edge fraying...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{protection}} factor (UPF) of {{woven fabrics}} is modeled by using two soft computing approaches, namely adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and {{artificial neural network}} (ANN). Three fabric parameters: proportion of polyester in weft yarns, <b>weft</b> count, and <b>pick</b> density are used as input parameters for predicting fabric UPF. Two levels (low and high) of membership function {{for each of the}} input parameters are used to reduce the complexity of ANFIS. The eight linguistic fuzzy rules trained by ANFIS are able to explain the relationship between fabric parameters and UPF. A comparison between ANFIS and ANN models is also presented. Both the models predict the UPF of fabrics with very good prediction accuracy in the testing data sets...|$|R

There are fragments of green/blue yarn on several pieces. Some minor fraying...|$|R
