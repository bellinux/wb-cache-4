A talented swimmer and artist, she also became {{interested}} in dancing during her childhood, taking dancing lessons and performing across Europe.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Tenebrae, Regis and Noctis—who is recuperating from a near-death experience—are {{targeted}} for assassination by Niflheim. Tenebrae is subsequently attacked, and in the invasion Queen Sylva is killed by Niflheim's General Glauca.

5|$|The myth of Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in various ways. The transformation of Myrrha in Ovid's version {{has been interpreted}} as a punishment for her breaking the social rules through her incestuous relationship with her father. Like Byblis who fell in love <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> Myrrha is transformed and rendered voiceless making her unable to break the taboo of incest.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Mary's father in September 1506, her mother's mental health began to deteriorate. Mary, along <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> Archduke Charles, and her sisters, Archduchesses Eleanor and Isabella, was put into the care of her {{paternal}} aunt, Archduchess Margaret, while two other siblings, Archduke Ferdinand and posthumously-born Archduchess Catherine, remained in Castile. Mary, Isabella, and Eleanor were educated together at their aunt's court in Mechelen. Their music teacher was Henry Bredemers.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her off <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, {{capital of the}} Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E

However, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brothers</b> unable to travel and pursue the career {{musician}} life that May and Little craved, they asked Little's high-school friend Jason Douglas to join and also recruited Brian's younger brother Drew to play drums. The band was renamed [...] "Veda".|$|R

5|$|As a teenager, Quin {{heard that}} Fergal Devitt and Paul Tracey were opening a wrestling school in Ireland. In June 2002, {{she and her}} brother began {{training}} there. She made her professional wrestling debut five months later in November, using the ring name Rebecca Knox. She teamed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> in mixed tag team matches during {{the early part of}} her career. She also trained at British professional wrestling promotion NWA UK Hammerlock.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Pierre Messiaen enlisted and Cécile took their two boys to live <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> in Grenoble. There Messiaen became fascinated with drama, reciting Shakespeare to his brother {{with the help of}} a home-made toy theatre with translucent backdrops made from old cellophane wrappers. At this time he also adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Later, Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the Dauphiné, where he had a house built south of Grenoble where he composed most of his music.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys is {{beginning}} to gain confidence in her new role as Drogo's wife and gains {{the respect of the}} exiled knight Ser Jorah Mormont, but her relationship <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Viserys becomes strained when he angrily assaults her under the assumption that she is giving him commands. As punishment, Viserys is choked and nearly killed by Daenerys's bloodrider Rakharo and is forced to walk back to camp after Daenerys intervenes to spare his life.|$|E

Her frustration stems from her unhappy home life; {{she lives in}} a public housing estate <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Tiny and their single father, Sandro. Sandro pays for Tiny's boxing training in hopes of his becoming a professional boxer, although Tiny would prefer to be an artist.|$|E
5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, {{who later became}} the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone {{in the same room}} with the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the British people. It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours or whether they were circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E
5|$|The estate at Wierzchownia was isolated. Hańska {{was bored}} by {{visits to the}} court at St. Petersburg, and even more bored by noble guests in her own home. She found {{nothing in common with}} the ladies of high society, and longed for the {{stimulating}} discussions she had enjoyed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Henryk. She spent her time reading the books her husband imported from faraway lands.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{was still}} {{attached}} to her old friend when Mary Dudley left the court in July 1579because of bad health, or out of solidarity <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Robert, Earl of Leicester, who was in disgrace for having married. She joined her husband at Ludlow in 1582, where he was serving his third turn as President of the Council of Wales. A year later her health {{was in such a}} state that Henry Sidney believed he would soon have the opportunity to take a second wife. Mary Dudley died on 9August 1586, three months after her husband, in whose elaborate funeral she had participated. She was buried by his side at Penshurst.|$|E
5|$|In late 1873, Brunner {{suffered}} a paralysis {{of his left}} side which prevented him from working. By mid-April 1874, he had sufficiently recovered to begin soliciting the provincial government for suitable employment. However, {{on the morning of}} 22 April he {{suffered a}} stroke and died few hours later. His funeral service was held at Nelson Cathedral and was attended by several hundred people. A large Māori contingent, including his long-time friend Kehu, was also present. Brunner was buried at Wakapuaka Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, who moved to England soon after his death. She lived <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> until her death in 1895. The couple had no children.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{building}} feud, Spencer's sister Stephanie Pratt initially took a disliking to Conrad. However, she later apologized to Conrad for an earlier confrontation, and the pair became friends. Their relationship put a burden on Pratt's relationship <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> and Montag, who reacted by beginning to alienate her. Conrad and Port eventually left their positions at Teen Vogue after receiving employment from Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. By {{the end of the}} season, Conrad and Patridge had moved out of their apartment and purchased a home, with new housemate Bosworth becoming a distancing factor between the former two.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1968, Motown {{initiated}} {{a number of}} high-profile collaborations for the Supremes with their old colleagues, the Temptations. Besides {{the fact that both}} groups had come up together, the pairings made financial sense: the Supremes had a mostly white fanbase, while the Temptations a mostly black fanbase. By 1969, the label began plans for a Diana Ross solo career. A number of candidates—most notably Syreeta Wright—were considered to replace Ross. After seeing 24-year-old Jean Terrell perform <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother</b> Ernie in Florida, Berry Gordy decided on Ross' replacement. Terrell was signed to Motown and began recording the first post-Ross Supremes songs with Wilson and Birdsong during the day, while Wilson and Birdsong toured with Ross at night. At the same time, Ross began to make her first solo recordings. In November 1969, Ross' solo career was publicly announced.|$|E
5|$|Isabella, with Edward's envoys, {{carried out}} {{negotiations}} with the French in late March. The negotiations proved difficult, and they arrived at a settlement only after Isabella personally intervened <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother,</b> Charles. The terms favoured the French crown: in particular, Edward would give homage in person to Charles for Gascony. Concerned {{about the consequences of}} war breaking out once again, Edward agreed to the treaty but decided to give Gascony to his son, Edward, and sent the prince to give homage in Paris. The young Prince Edward crossed the English Channel and completed the bargain in September.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British {{officers}} a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match {{only to find}} that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball — new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (which the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha deliberately drops many catches. Later that evening, Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>brother.</b> She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.|$|E
