5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone, the <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{hardy breed}} with few breed {{specific}} health problems. The main hereditary problem {{highlighted by the}} American Sealyham Terrier Club is an eye condition called lens luxation, for which there are DNA tests. Lens luxation is {{a condition in which}} the lens slips out of position in the eyeball due to the <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibers that holds it in place.|$|E
5|$|<b>Weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{individual}} mandate {{through his}} first executive order, {{which resulted in}} limiting enforcement of mandate penalties by the IRS. For example, tax returns without indications of health insurance ("silent returns") will still be processed, overriding instructions from the Obama administration to the IRS to reject them.|$|E
50|$|Ectropion is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which the lower eyelid turns outwards. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notable aspects <b>of</b> newborns exhibiting congenital Harlequin-type ichthyosis, but ectropion can occur due to any <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower eyelid. The condition can be repaired surgically. Ectropion {{is also found in}} dogs as a genetic disorder in certain breeds.|$|R
40|$|A {{conjecture}} by Bollobás from 1995 (which is a <b>weakenning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous Tree Packing Conjecture by Gyárfás from 1976) {{states that}} any set of k trees T_n,T_n- 1, [...] .,T_n-k+ 1, such that T_n-i has n-i vertices, pack into K_n, provided n is sufficiently large. We confirm Bollobás conjecture for trees T_n,T_n- 1, [...] .,T_n-k+ 1, such that T_n-i has k- 1 -i leaves or a pending path of order k- 1 -i. As a consequence we obtain that the conjecture {{is true for}} k≤ 5...|$|R
50|$|Austria {{remained}} a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> re-established German Confederation, while Prussia still tried {{to improve its}} position within the confederation and even cherished its union plans. Around 1860, the German question became dynamic again. Austria came out <b>weakened</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year while Prusssia sought to gain <b>the</b> approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national movement. Several proposals were made to reform the German Confederation, most notably in 1863 at the Frankfurter Fürstentag. At this moment, <b>the</b> networks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political elites in Lesser Germany were already quite separate from the Austrian ones.|$|R
5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E

50|$|Cyclogenesis is <b>the</b> {{opposite}} <b>of</b> cyclolysis, which concerns <b>the</b> <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> surface cyclones. <b>The</b> {{term has}} an anticyclonic (high pressure system) equivalent—Anticyclogenesis, {{which deals with}} <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> surface high pressure systems.|$|R
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as it could have been.|$|E
5|$|Fort Steuben Bridge's replacement, the Veterans Memorial Bridge, was {{completed}} in 1990. The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding for maintaining the Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure over time. The assessment prompted a weight limit; reducing the bridge's traffic which consisted of heavy trucks. The bridge {{was known to be}} affected by rain vibration.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil and other similar disasters, the need to reinforce the buckling frontiers stretched the military and financial resources of the Caliphate. This was especially the case with the powerful Syrian army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime, which was parcelled out to reinforce distant provinces. Eventually, this <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the Dutch, Frisian and German dialects formed perfect dialect continuum, {{which has}} been {{gradually}} falling apart since the Late Middle Ages due to <b>the</b> pressures <b>of</b> modern education, standard languages, migration and <b>weakening</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dialects.|$|R

5|$|Initially exhibiting {{characteristics}} of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge {{to the south of}} Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, though {{at the same time the}} BoM noted the slight <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.|$|E
5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{ratification}} {{of this law}} was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what they regarded as the <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning of marriage. Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children. Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people {{from all parts of}} Spain. After its approval, the conservative People's Party challenged the law in the Constitutional Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. Turning back to the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E

50|$|Age also {{contributes}} to disorders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee. Particularly in older people, knee pain frequently arises due to osteoarthritis.

5|$|Unfavorable {{environmental}} conditions caused <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane by September4 as it resumed a west-northwest course away from Hawaii. Conditions later became favorable and Uleki acquired winds of 105mph (165mph) on September7, constituting its secondary peak. The hurricane crossed the International Dateline on September8 and was reclassified as typhoon. Remaining {{well away from}} land, the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by September12. Gradually turning north and later east, the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on September17 near the International Dateline.|$|E
5|$|After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz {{variation}} 3...Ne4 which {{concentrates on}} the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the bishop pair and tries to break through on the queenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps the material advantage of a pawn {{at the cost of}} a <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white pawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sack}} of Constantinople in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine {{successor}} states were established: the Empire of Nicaea, and the Despotate of Epirus. A third, the Empire of Trebizond, {{was created by}} Alexios I of Trebizond {{a few weeks before}} the sack of Constantinople. Of the three successor states, Epirus and Nicaea stood the best chance of reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled to survive the next few decades, however, and by the mid-13th century it had lost much of southern Anatolia. The <b>weakening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sultanate of Rûm following the Mongol invasion in 1242–43 allowed many beyliks and ghazis to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor. In time, one of the Beys, Osman I, created an empire that would eventually conquer Constantinople. However, the Mongol invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks, allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire to its north.|$|E
