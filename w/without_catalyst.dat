However, [EMIM]Tos produced less 5 -HMF from cellulose and wood, compared with [EMIM]HSO 4. This is due to the difference of ability to decompose cellulose and wood between these ionic liquids. Consequently, among various ionic liquids studied, [EMIM]HSO 4 achieved the highest yield of 5 -HMF from wood and cellulose at 4.5 and 10.2 wt% yields, respectively, after 10  h at 140  °C.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine was}} a cast iron V8 with single {{overhead}} camshafts operating sodium-filled valves against hardened valve seats on each aluminium alloy cylinder head. Each hand-built unit was bench-tested for 265 minutes, 40 {{of which were}} under full load. Bosch K-Jetronic electromechanical fuel injection was standard {{at a time when}} fuel-injected cars were uncommon. As in all Mercedes-Benz automobile engines, the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons were forged instead of cast. The 6.9 l (6834 cc or 417 in³) power plant was factory-rated at 286 hp (213 kW) with 405 lb·ft (549 N·m) of torque helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final drive ratio necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. A special version for Australia, based on the North American version, however <b>without</b> <b>catalyst,</b> was rated at 269 hp (198 kW) with 51 kpm (510 N·m) of torque. In the interest of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system was used. The system circulated twelve quarts of oil between the storage tank and the engine, as opposed to the usual four or five quarts found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached {{to the inside of the}} tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.|$|E
