500|$|Parker and Stone {{had trouble}} {{deciding}} how to resolve the episode and bring the zombie characters back to life. Although they ultimately settled on having Kyle kill the [...] "main zombie" [...] {{to bring back the}} others, Parker did not feel the resolution made sense and described it as a deus ex machina. Parker said of the ending, [...] "This was another big one of those episodes where we were sort of (like), 'How do <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this one?'" [...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving. But we were totally wrong, people totally loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|In a January 20, 1990, contest against conference foe Tennessee, Pitino benched senior {{shooting}} guard Derrick Miller {{to start the}} second half, giving his spot to Farmer. Farmer, who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half, responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half. Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 {{points in the second}} half as the Wildcats turned a 4439 halftime deficit into a 9583 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him get more comfortable in the game. After a mid-week loss to Auburn, Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup, replacing Sean Woods, for the Wildcats' January 27 contest against Ole Miss. [...] "We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration. We'll try Richie Farmer at the point and see what <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that. Right now we're not getting too much out of that position," [...] Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference. In a 9879 victory, Farmer tallied 11 points, 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes; Woods registered 8 points, 4 assists, and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench. Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats' next game against Mississippi State, and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
