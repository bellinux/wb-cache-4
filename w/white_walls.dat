5|$|The video {{starts with}} Paramore holding {{electric}} guitars, heading towards {{the side of}} a bridge. They begin smashing clocks with guitars on a roadside, and a title screen appears, announcing that the band broke the record of smashing 30 clocks with guitars— at a time of 31.33 seconds. The camera shifts to a room where the group attempts to catch flying feathers; Davis breaks the record of catching the most (18) feathers in 30 s. The next scene shows the group wearing eye goggles, in a room with <b>white</b> <b>walls,</b> destroying vinyl records in several ways—such as ripping them, stepping on them or punching them. The band breaks another record, after smashing 58 vinyl records in a minute, the highest number of broken records for that time. While the band is destroying more records, York makes a record as an individual by spinning a record on his finger for 32.81 s—the least time ever for that accomplishment.|$|E

25|$|The frescoes' {{effect on}} Renaissance artists was instant and {{profound}} (it {{can be seen}} most obviously in Raphael's decoration for the loggias in the Vatican), and the <b>white</b> <b>walls,</b> delicate swags, and bands of friezeframed reserves containing figures or landscapeshave returned at intervals ever since, notably in late 18th century Neoclassicism, making Famulus {{one of the most}} influential painters in the history of art.|$|E
25|$|According to NBC, the set for {{the show}} has had two major changes over the years. When the show first started in 1991, it was very basic with <b>white</b> <b>walls,</b> {{in an effort to}} capture the feel of fellow talk show Donahue, Jerry's haircut and glasses even seeming to make him look like Phil Donahue. The general look of this set was carried over when the series first moved to Chicago in September 1992, with an unpolished, open air look and bright colored shapes.|$|E
25|$|The central nave is {{decorated}} with evenly spaced sculptures of the twelve apostles. It also {{has a number of}} torture scenes from the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. These martyrs include Saint Sebastian, knights Saint George and Martin of Tours, Saint Maurice and the Theban Legion, Fidelis of Como and Victor Maurus. However, they are not immediately visible as they are placed in niches. Therefore, the nave is dominated by plain <b>white</b> <b>walls</b> that contrast with the opulent decorations elsewhere. From the central nave, the entrance to each of the four chapels has two allegorical female figures, representing eight Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount and created according to the iconography of Cesare Ripa. Their placement above the entrance arch is very similar to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. However, they are not depicted in order but rearranged so that they would better reflect the themes of the chapels.|$|E

500|$|One of the film's most {{excessively}} violent scenes {{features the}} death of Neal's ex-wife, Jane (played by Veronica Lario). This scene was one which suffered the most from cuts when the film was first released in Italy. The original scene featured Jane's arm being cut off at the elbow; blood sprays from the wound onto <b>white</b> <b>walls</b> until the character falls to the floor. After a back-and-forth between Argento and Italian censors (at the time a panel of judges), the scene was first trimmed from showing an [...] "immense" [...] spray to a small one, then a smaller one still. The scene was cut to almost nothing in the 1990s, when Lario married future Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to Alan Jones, Berlusconi [...] "did not want the public seeing [...] so explicitly murdered, {{even if it was}} in a film by his country's premier horror expert". For a few years, it was impossible to see the film in Italy legally, as prints were withdrawn altogether. A later DVD release did become available, with the scene restored.|$|E
500|$|The {{professional}} {{element in}} the orchestra {{was provided by the}} English Opera Group players, led by Emanuel Hurwitz, with [...] Ralph Downes at the organ. The children players, billed as [...] "An East Suffolk Children's Orchestra", included handbell ringers from the County Modern School, Leiston; a percussion group, whose instruments included the slung mugs, from Woolverstone Hall School; recorder players from Framlingham College; and bugle players from the Royal Hospital School, Holbrook. Graham, recalling the premiere some years later, wrote: [...] "The large orchestra (originally 150 players)... were massed around the font of Orford Church while the opera was played out on a stage erected {{at the end of the}} nave." [...] Philip Hope-Wallace, writing for The Manchester Guardian, observed that [...] "Charles Mackerras conducted the widespread forces, actually moving round a pillar to be able to control all sections in turn." [...] Martin Cooper of The Daily Telegraph noted: [...] "The <b>white</b> <b>walls</b> of Orford Church furnished an ideal background to the gay colours of Ceri Richards's costumes and the fantastic head-dresses of the animals. In fact, the future of the work will lie in village churches such as this and with amateur musicians, for whom Britten has written something both wholly new and outstandingly original." ...|$|E
500|$|Siegfried Kracauer said by {{coupling}} {{a fantasy}} in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority, with {{a reality in}} which authority triumphs over Francis, Caligari reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it. A contrast between levels of reality exists {{not only in the}} characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well. This, as Barlow writes, [...] "reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos". For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Dr. Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Dr. Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Dr. Caligari and Cesare. The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is particularly prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against <b>white</b> <b>walls,</b> but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Dr. Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes.|$|E

2500|$|The National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI for short), in Rome, was {{designed}} and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture {{is the sense of}} movement; [...] Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving <b>white</b> <b>walls</b> and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as [...] "bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take you off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called [...] "confluence, interference and turbulence", ...|$|E
2500|$|The Betty Parsons Gallery {{opened in}} 1946 at 15 East 57th Street in Manhattan. [...] The gallery {{regularly}} exhibited twelve shows a season, from September to May, with each show lasting only {{two to three}} weeks. At {{a time when the}} market for avant-garde American art was minuscule, Parsons was the only dealer willing to represent artists like Jackson Pollock after Peggy Guggenheim closed her Art of This Century gallery and returned to Europe in 1947. Parsons showed work by William Congdon, Clyfford Still, Theodoros Stamos, Ellsworth Kelly, Mark Rothko, Hedda Sterne, Forrest Bess, Michael Loew, Lyman Kipp, Judith Godwin, and Robert Rauschenberg among others. In 1950, she gave Barnett Newman, whom she had met in 1943, his first solo show; Rothko and Tony Smith assisted with the installation. In the late 1950s, Smith and Newman helped to remodel Parsons’ gallery, creating an almost cube-shaped main space framed by <b>white</b> <b>walls</b> with subtly curved corners and a concrete floor whose proportions fitted their ordered works. Helen Frankenthaler, the painter, who met Parsons in 1950, said, [...] "Betty and her gallery helped construct the center of the art world. She {{was one of the last}} of her breed." [...] Many of the Abstract Expressionist artists she had launched left her gallery for more commercial galleries such as Sam Kootz and Sidney Janis. Art critic B. H. Friedman noted, [...] "She was resentful. She had struggled so long to get them established, and other dealers capitalized on her efforts." ...|$|E
