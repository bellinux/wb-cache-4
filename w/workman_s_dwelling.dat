40|$|Tools for {{machining}} {{are made}} of hard steels and cemented carbide (WC-Co). For specialized applications, such as aluminium machining, diamond or polycrystalline cubic boron nitride are also used. The main problem with steel, is that it exhibits a relatively low hardness (below 10 GPa) which strongly decreases upon annealing above about 600 K. Thus, the majority of modern tools are nowadays coated with hard coatings that increase the hardness, decrease the coefficient of friction and protect the tools against oxidation. A similar approach has been recently used to obtain a longer duration of the dies for aluminium die-casting. Multi-component and nanostructured materials represent a promising class of protective hard coatings due to their enhanced mechanical and thermal oxidation properties. Surface properties modification is {{an effective way to}} improve the performances of materials subjected to thermo-mechanical stress. Three different thin hard nitrogen-rich coatings were mechanically, microstructurally, and thermally characterized: a 2. 5 micron-thick CrN-NbN, a 11. 7 micron-thick TiAlN, and a 2. 92 micron-thick AlTiCrxNy. The CrN-NbN coating main feature is the fabrication by the alternate deposition of 4 nm thick-nanolayer of NewChrome (new type of CrN, with strong adhesion and low coating temperature). All the three coatings can reach hardness and elastic modulus in excess of 20, and 250 GPa, respectively. Their main applications include stainless steel drawing, plastic materials forming and extrusion and aluminum alloys die-casting. The here studied TiAlN (SBN, super booster nitride) is one of the latest evolution of TiAlN coatings for cutting applications, where maximum resistance to wear and oxidation are required. The AlTiCrxNy combines the very high wear resistance characteristic of the Cr-coatings and the high thermal stability and high-temperature hardness typical of Al-containing coatings. All the coatings were deposited on a S 600 tool steels. The coatings were subjected to two different thermal cycling tests: one for 100 thermal cycles consisting of 60 <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> time, respectively at the high- (573 to 1173 K) and at the room-temperature, a second for 100 thermal cycles consisting of 115 <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> time, at same temperatures of the first test, followed by 5 <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> at room-temperature. The investigated coatings showed a sufficient-to-optimal thermal response in terms of stability of hardness, elastic modulus, and oxidation behavior. The temperature induced hardness and elastic modulus coating variations were measured by nanoindentation.

40|$|The European Union has set ambitious {{targets for}} 2020 {{known as the}} 20 / 20 / 20 targets aiming to reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions by 20 %, increase the share of renewables to 20 % and improve energy efficiency by 20 %. Buildings represents 40 % of the final energy use in the EU and has a large potential for contributing to these targets by implementing energy efficiency measures. Refurbishment of aging buildings together {{with the implementation of}} better solutions for energy performance becomes important. Often policy roadmaps use detailed information on energy and emission intensities, but lacks detailed information about the building stock itself. Renovation rates are often assumed to be easily increased by policy makers, but studies have shown that renovation rates are highly dependent on stock composition. As building stocks consists of different building types and age cohorts the potential for improved energy efficiency will vary due to changing technologies and building codes in the past. The energy characteristics and dynamics of the national dwelling stock of Norway has been investigated in previous studies. However, {{it is likely that the}} dwelling stock on a local scale could be of a different nature than the national average and that the local dwelling stock energy characteristics could differ from the national average. A regionalization of a dwelling stock model to develop specialized regionalized energy policies could prove to be of importance to local legislators, businesses and stakeholders. This MSc thesis models the energy use from the Norwegian city of Trondheim <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock by using a regionalized segmented dynamic stock model. Statistical data has been gathered for the period of 1800 to present day, combined with population forecasts and implemented into the model. A detailed energy analysis has been run on Trondheim <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock based on stock composition and corresponding parameters for sub segments, archetypes and cohorts such as average heated floor area, energy intensities, energy mix and system efficiencies. Four possible future scenarios in addition to the business as usual scenario has been analyzed. The results suggest that the composition of Trondheim <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock differs from the national stock. The energy characteristics has also been shown to differ from the national average. Trondheim <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock has been shown to have a larger share of Multi Family Houses than the national average. Additionally, the stock has a larger share of older dwellings. A future dwelling stock growth is expected. The energy analysis has shown that Trondheim s energy mix differs from the national average with a higher share of district heating. Historically, Trondheim s energy intensity has also been lower than the national average. Through the scenario analysis a roadmap giving possible future energy characteristics for Trondheim <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock has been created. Baseline results suggests that even though the dwelling stock is expected to increase the delivered energy to the system is expected to experience only minor growth. However, the potential for future energy savings is large. In the most optimistic scenario a 37 % decrease of delivered energy in 2050 compared to present day is expected. Somewhat surprisingly it has been shown that the potential for energy efficiency measures through advanced and more frequent renovation is limited. This is due to that much of the possible gains will be reached anyway before 2050 through natural standard renovation. However, an extensive policy of local energy use by using HPs and PVs has proven to be very effective and represents the largest opportunity for energy savings towards 2050. Moreover, it has been shown that there is a large potential to shift the current energy mix in the city to a larger share of district heating in 2050. This could represent an opportunity to free surplus electricity that can then be used to replace more carbon intensive energy carriers in other sectors. For instance, by powering a future electrical vehicle park with electricity. It has been shown that it will also be important in Trondheim as found for the whole country by Sandberg et al. (2017) to make efforts to limit the expected rebound effect. As the theoretical estimated energy need intensity decrease in the stock a change in user behavior is expected to counteract the improved energy efficiency through a higher energy use. This will limit the potential for energy savings in the stock and policies should be created to minimize this change in user behavior. The findings suggest that regionalized dwelling stock models will indeed be of great use for local policy makers. It has given much needed insight into Trondheim <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock composition. The model s ability to assess the stock s energy mix on a per type, cohort and archetype level has proven to be of key use when assessing the potential for district heating in Trondheim. Through a scenario based energy analysis of a segmented dynamic dwelling stock model different possible energy policies can be compared and tested against each other on a long-term scale...|$|R

40|$|Most {{dwellings}} in the United States are ventilated {{primarily through}} leaks {{in the building}} shell (i. e., infiltration) rather than by whole-house mechanical ventilation systems. Consequently, quantification of envelope air-tightness is critical to determining how much energy is being lost through infiltration and how much infiltration is contributing toward ventilation requirements. Envelope air tightness and air leakage can be determined from fan pressurization measurements with a blower door. Tens of thousands of unique fan pressurization measurements have been made of U. <b>S.</b> <b>dwellings</b> over the past decades. LBNL has collected the available data on residential infiltration into its Residential Diagnostics Database, {{with support from the}} U. S. Department of Energy.

The work reported here is an update of similar efforts carried out a decade ago, which used available data largely focused on the housing stock, rather than on new construction. The current effort emphasizes shell tightness measurements made on houses soon after they are built. These newer data come from over two dozen datasets, including over 73, 000 measurements spread throughout a majority of the U. S. Roughly one-third of the measurements are for houses identified as energy-efficient through participation in a government or utility program.

40|$|International audienceSemi-volatile organic {{compounds}} (SVOCs) partition indoors between the gas phase, airborne particles, settled dust, and other surfaces. Unknown concentrations of SVOCs {{in the gas}} phase (Cg) can be predicted from their measured concentrations in airborne particles. In previous studies, the prediction of Cg depended largely on choosing a specific equation for the calculation of the particle/gas partition coefficient. Moreover, the prediction of Cg is frequently performed at a reference temperature rather than the real indoor temperature. In this paper, a probabilistic approach based on Monte Carlo simulation was developed to predict the distribution of SVOCs' Cg from their concentrations in airborne particles at the target indoor temperature. Moreover, {{the distribution of the}} particle/gas partition coefficient of each SVOC at the target temperature was used. The approach was validated using two measured datasets in the literature: the predicted Cg from concentrations measured in airborne particles and the measured Cg were generally of the same order of magnitude. The distributions of the Cg of 66 SVOCs in the French housing stock were then predicted. The SVOCs with the highest median Cg, ranging from 1  ng/m 3 to >  100  ng/m 3, included 8 phthalates (DEP, DiBP, DBP, DEHP, BBP, DMP, DiNP, and DMEP), 4 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and anthracene), 2 alkylphenols (4 -tert-butylphenol and 4 -tert-octylphenol), 2 synthetic musks (galaxolide and tonalide), tributyl phosphate, and heptachlor.

40|$|The {{household}} {{is one of}} {{the basic}} settings for human social activity, and the study of this fundamental unit provides valuable insight concerning human interaction with the natural and social environments. The study of past households is especially important for examining these interactions through both time and space. Archaeological data constitute one of the most valuable and, often, one of the only sources of information about past households. Intrasite spatial analysis provides methods for examining the material content, structure and organization of past households but, unfortunately, many of these methods are limited in their utility for practical applications. Further, few models of household behavior in a spatial context have been developed. This dissertation addresses these problems by, (a) presenting a method of intrasite spatial analysis for use at historic period archaeological sites and, (b) developing a model of household behavior in a spatial context which is used to interpret the archaeological analysis. ^ The focus of this analysis is the colonial Chesapeake house hold. Methods are developed for analyzing architectural, fence line, and secondary refuse midden data from the van Sweringen site, a late 17 th century/early 18 th century household and inn in St. Mary 2 ̆ 7 s City, Maryland. A model of household organization and behavior is developed through a review of contemporary and secondary historical sources from both England and the Chesapeake and from previous archaeological research conducted in the region. Further, a room-by-room inventory of van Sweringen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dwelling,</b> taken in 1700, provides an important link between the more general historical model and the archaeological site. ^ The analytical methods applied to the van Sweringen site reveal significant patterning in the archaeological record. This patterning is then linked to chronological, social, and functional variability suggested by the historical model. Manifestations of public and private space, building and room use, and social status are all clearly visible in the archaeological record at the van Sweringen site. This analysis not only has important implications for the study of colonial Chesapeake culture, it demonstrates that temporal, social and functional variation in a spatial context can be deciphered and interpreted from the archaeological record. ...|$|R

The excavated buildings included the original 1638 manor house, 1640 s and 1660 s outbuildings, and a circa 1720 replacement farmhouse. Historical records document another dwelling of the 1740 s. Architectural preservation at the excavated sites was unusually good and significantly increased our knowledge of Chesapeake construction. The evolution of these structures illustrates extensive environmental and social adaptation. What society produced these buildings? What do these buildings {{tell us about that}} society?^ Manorial lord and Provincial Secretary John Lewger established St. John 2 ̆ 7 s Freehold. Circa 1640, his household numbered twenty persons. By English standards, Lewger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dwelling</b> was a modest center for such a household. By frontier standards, it was an unusually expensive one, as early Maryland carpenters commanded wages thrice those of their English peers. Subsequent owners of St. John 2 ̆ 7 s resorted to cheaper forms of construction. ^ During Maryland 2 ̆ 7 s first century, architecture evolved through four phases. The 1638 house was representative of the first [...] the importation of English prototypes. Few were functional in the Chesapeake. By circa 1650, carpenters were evolving a peculiarly Chesapeake architecture based on riven timber, post-in-the-ground framing, and tobacco house scaffolding. These buildings were cheap, but rotted down in 25 years. Circa 1675 - 1725, rapid evolution continued as carpenters developed a more enduring, inexpensive structure. Their product was the 2 ̆ 2 bastard 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 lap work 2 ̆ 2 building, a structure whose sills were raised off the ground on cedar or locust blocks, but whose walls and roofs were framed without expensive mortise and tenon joints. Following the 1713 improvement in tobacco prices, crude frontier construction increasingly was replaced with improved box-frame or brick buildings, but these new structures were thoroughly Chesapeake in design and bore little resemblance to the English structures that had been imported into the Chesapeake only a century earlier. ^ The rapid evolution of Chesapeake architecture establishes that seventeenth-century Englishmen were technologically innovative. This same evolution makes the study of architecture an effective way of monitoring cultural adaptation and social change. ...|$|R

This dissertation explores the hermit 2 ̆ 7 s but or the ascetic but as a key trope in ascetic discourse and proceeds to establish its significance {{in the context of}} ancient India. The study also attempts to untie the semantic knot that exists between the dweller and his dwelling, the two forming a crucial conjunction in the discourse. The dweller is also the “perfected ascetic” who has acquired that status by dint of achieving “enlightenment,” the most compelling figure being the Buddha. The ideal of ascetic perfectibility in the Indic context required an extensive review of Buddhist literature and iconography. ^ The ascetic but presents a polysemy, drawn from imageries of pragmatic dwellings to profound ideations. I have, in conclusion, proposed the term the “last” but to illustrate distinctive aspects in this diversity. Ascetic architecture, in essence, is a civilizational project, {{despite the fact that the}} ascetic but denotes a wide variety of domiciliary structures, from primitive to normative, and from naturalistic caves to trees. The “last” but condenses various shades of the ascetical enterprise, from considering the but as the symbol of being-in-the-world to being the emblem of “emptiness,” but most importantly embodying the enigmatic terminal goal (“enlightenment”) of the “perfected ascetic” visualized in the words of the Buddha as the cataclysmic event of “breaking the roof. ” ^ The characterization of the hermit 2 ̆ 7 s but as being intimately tied with its dweller presented a scope broader than architectural history. The study involved an inquiry into ascetical, religious, sociological and anthropological topics. Buddhist resources—literary and iconographic—form the core of the study, although works from Brahmanical sources are also included. The work of Joseph Rykwert provided a theoretical orientation towards the elemental hut, while the work of various Indological scholars, particularly Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Mircea Eliade, Stella Kramrisch, Sukumar Dutt, and more recently, Patrick Olivelle and Michael W. Meister established crucial Indic themes in the argument. While the dissertation benefited from this scholarship, it also recognizes that none of the work fully proposes the hermit 2 ̆ 7 s but as an ideational type, and considers elaborating its significance in the ascetic imagination. ...|$|R
30|$|The KB is {{the only}} method among the {{proposed}} ones in which the time to input a particular character {{does not depend on}} the previously entered one. Actually, every character, if not from the shortcut set, requires exactly five regular discrete tilts, i.e. 5 × 0.43 = 2.15 seconds. Of course, this holds for expert behavior, assuming no time is wasted for finding the desired character, or thinking about bisection strategy. Another characteristic of the expertise is performing long discrete tilts of duration of exactly 2.43 seconds (0.43 s for discrete-tilt movements and precisely 2 <b>s</b> for <b>dwelling).</b> However, this is extremely difficult, since a user will usually dwell in a valid tilt zone for a little longer. Shortcut activation times seem strange at first. Namely, the model predicts faster shortcut activation using regular tilts (4 × 0.43 = 1.72 s) in comparison with the single long tilt (2.43 s), thus the shortcut concept can be questioned. At this point we state that shortcuts do not always provide time gain, but are extremely valuable in lowering the interaction burden. Doing four regular tilts instead of one long tilt will certainly increase the fatigue level.|$|R

Mrs. Hilton desired a photograph {{to send to}} relatives back East, but felt embarrassed by the family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> sod <b>dwelling.</b> She insisted that Butcher not take {{a photo of the}} house, but asked the men to drag the Hiltons 2 ̆ 7 beautiful new pump organ out into the field, where the family could pose around the instrument. The sod house remained outside the photograph, and after the session the men returned the organ to the house. To Mrs. Hilton, the organ became her personal symbol of aspirations to middle-class refinement in spite of harsh conditions. While the Hiltons certainly could not control the circumstances of living in a dirt home, Mrs. Hilton could control the public display of refinement in her rural Plains home. Women who settled in the Great Plains between 1880 and 1920 often encountered the harshest of conditions and yet still sought to achieve 2 ̆ 2 gentility 2 ̆ 2 through various civilizing processes. These included adaptations of domestic refinement, access to material goods and literary culture, and the performance of civilizing manners and behavior that represented 2 ̆ 2 proper 2 ̆ 2 Euro-American civilization...|$|R
40|$|Cabins have {{a special}} place in the hearts of Norwegians. A main aspect of cabins is their {{function}} as meeting places between nature and civilization. It is therefore meaningful to read the cabin as a symbol of Norwegian identity and nature relations. Cabins are however in transition, and the objective of this thesis is to gain better awareness of the evolution of cabins in Norwegian culture and what this evolution might signify in terms of Norwegians understandings of nature. This thesis provides a qualitative semiotic analysis of nature in Norwegian cabin representations in selected media. It aims to answer the following research question: What is the role of nature in Norwegian mass media cabin representations in the 1960 s and today (2013 - 14) ? To answer this question this thesis provides a semiotic analysis of selected media: a cabin issue of Bonytt (1963), six articles in A-Magasinet (1964 - 67) and three issues of Hyttemagasinet (2013 - 2014). This semiotic study is coupled with a theoretical framework inspired by phenomenology: Tim Ingold <b>s</b> (2014) <b>Dwelling</b> Perspective, an alternative theoretical framework to understanding modern life as a negotiation between the dwelling and commodity perspectives. By applying this framework I attempt to offer an analysis of cabin representations of nature experiences in my data. I hope my findings can offer better insight in terms of Norwegian understandings of nature {{and at the same time}} contribute to a broader field of research on dwelling in modernity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Refractive error {{has been}} shown to {{fluctuate}} in poorly controlled diabetic patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure acute diurnal fluctuations in refractive error and blood glucose levels (BGLs) in diabetic and control subjects. Methods: Twenty-one type 2 diabetic subjects (age 56 ± 11 years), 20 type 1 diabetic subjects (age 38 ± 15 years) and 20 non-diabetic controls (age 49 ± 23 years) took part in the study. Refractive error was measured with an OPD ARK- 10000 autorefractometer (Nidek) and BGLs were measured using a finger stick test (Hemocue). All measurements were taken six times during the day, between 8 AM and 8 PM at approximately twohourly intervals. Using power vector analysis the variability in refractive error was mapped against time of day and related to BGLs, HbA 1 c, diabetic status and duration of disease. Results: Refractive error was similar between groups (p= 0. 96) and did not fluctuate significantly during the day in any of the three groups (ANOVA p> 0. 05). The mean ± SD values for BGLs during the day were 10. 4 ± 4. 40 mM/l in DM type 2, 10. 3 ± 5. 30 mM/l in DM type 1, and 5. 4 ± 1. 04 mM/l in control subjects. BGLs changed significantly during the day and between groups (ANOVA p 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis showed that neither BGLs, HbA 1 c, diabetic status, nor duration of disease had a significant effect on diurnal refractive error measurements. (p> 0. 05). Conclusions: Diurnal changes in BGLs do not result in significant acute refractive error fluctuations in diabetic patients, as measured with an autorefractometer. CR: C.

40|$|William Duncan Strong 2 ̆ 7 s {{excavation}} team, {{working at}} the base of the major ceremonial mound at Cahuachi, in the Nasca Valley, on the South Coast of Peru, encountered evidence of a thickly woven plain white cloth (fig. 1).

40|$|Context: Thyroid hormone use {{is common}} in older populations, but the {{frequency}} of over- or under-replacement is debated. Objective: We sought to describe the frequency of and factors associated with thyroid hormone over- or under-replacement in a population of older men and women. Design: Participants were 3678 U. <b>S.</b> community <b>dwelling</b> individuals aged 65 yr or older enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study who had thyroid function tests in 1989 – 1990. Thyroid hormone users (n = 339) were identified and classified into low TSH (4. 5 mU/liter). Results: Of the 339 thyroid hormone users, 41 % had a low TSH, 16 % had a high TSH, and 43 % were in the euthyroid range. In multivariable analyses, lower weight (P < 0. 001) was independently associated with low TSH status. For every 10 kg lower weight, the likelihood of having low TSH increased by 65 % [odd ratio (OR) 1. 65; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 31 – 2. 07]. Those with renal insufficiency {{were less likely to}} have low TSH levels (P = 0. 02). The presence of diabetes was independently associated with having low (OR 3. 35; 95 % CI 1. 46 – 7. 65) and high TSH levels (OR 2. 66; 95 % CI 1. 14 – 6. 21). Conclusions: There is a very high prevalence of thyroid function testing abnormalities in older people taking thyroid hormone preparations, particularly in those of low weight or with diabetes. Because of potential adverse cardiovascular and skeletal effects from over-replacement, older people represent a key population for increased TSH monitoring on therapy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} diurnal fluctuations in aberrations and blood glucose levels (BGLs) in diabetic patients and control subjects. Methods: Twenty-one type 2 diabetic subjects (age 56 ± 11 years), 20 type 1 diabetic subjects (age 38 ± 15 years) and 20 non-diabetic controls (age 49 ± 23 years) took part in the study. The distribution of refractive errors was similar between groups (p= 0. 96). Aberrations were measured with an OPD autorefractometer (NIDEK) and analysed for a 5 mm pupil diameter. BGLs were measured using a finger stick test (Hemocue). All measurements were taken six times during the day, between 8 AM and 8 PM at approximately two-hourly intervals. Results: The coefficients of third order coma, fourth order spherical aberration, and higher-order RMS error were found to be higher in the diabetic compared to the control group. The mean variation in the third and fourth order aberrations over the twelve-hour period was found to be higher in the diabetic when compared to the control group; however, these differences were not statistically significant. The higher-order RMS error showed a negative correlation with time in the diabetic group compared to a positive correlation in the control group (gradient: - 6. 4 x 10 - 3 in type 2 diabetes, - 24. 4 x 10 - 3 in type 1 diabetes and 74. 9 x 10 - 3 in control group; ANOVA p= 0. 025). In diabetic patients, increasing BGLs showed a negative trend with the third order horizontal coma (p= 0. 44) and fourth order spherical aberration coefficients (p= 0. 61), while a positive trend was observed between BGLs and the third order vertical coma (p= 0. 58) and higher order RMS (p= 0. 47). Conclusions: Compared to controls, diabetic patients exhibit greater variation in higher order aberrations. Ocular aberration coefficients varied during the day, with fluctuating BGLs. The variation in ocular aberration coefficients is possibly due to the effect of large fluctuations in BGLs leading to hydration effects on the diabetic crystalline lens. CR: B. Huntjens, None; H.

40|$|This study uses a novel spatial {{approach}} to compare population density change across cities and over time. It examines spatio-temporal change in Australia’s five most populated capital cities from 1981 to 2011, and documents the established and emerging patterns of population distribution. The settlement patterns of Australian cities have changed substantially {{in the last}} 30 years. From the doughnut cities of the 1980 s, programs of consolidation, renewal and densification have changed and concentrated population in our cities. Australian cities in the 1980 s were characterised by sparsely populated, low density centres with growth concentrated to the suburban fringes. ‘Smart Growth’ and the ‘New Urbanism’ movements in the 1990 <b>s</b> advocated higher <b>dwelling</b> density living and the inner cities re-emerged, inner areas were redeveloped, and the population distribution shifted towards increased inner city population densities. Policies aimed at re-populating the inner city dominated and the resultant changes are now visible in Australia’s five most populated capital cities. While this pattern {{has been reported in}} a number of studies, questions remain regarding the extent of these changes and how to analyse and visualise them across urban space. This paper reports on a spatial method which addresses the limitations of changing statistical boundaries to identify the changing patterns in Australian cities over time and space. Neil T.
