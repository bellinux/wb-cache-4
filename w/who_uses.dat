The percentage of female students regularly using supplements is 20. 9 %. Furthermore, 44. 2 % have used supplements and 32. 4 % have never used supplements. 2. The women <b>who</b> <b>use</b> supplements did so {{because they believe that}} it is good for health and are concerned about lack of proper intake of daily meals, more so than the women <b>who</b> <b>used</b> drinks. 3. The women <b>who</b> <b>use</b> supplements do so daily or twice a week which is more often than women <b>who</b> <b>use</b> drinks. 4.

Of the women <b>who</b> <b>use</b> supplements, 32. 1 % snack compared to 11. 1 % of non supplements users;therefore the number of women who snack is larger for those <b>who</b> <b>use</b> supplements. 7.

40|$|BackgroundThere {{have been}} no multicenter studies that {{estimated}} the relations of either nurse or pharmacist home visit program to drug costs of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). This study aimed to establish whether patients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse or pharmacist home visit programs (nurse or pharmacist program) had lower drug costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> did not <b>use</b> nurse or pharmacist programs for older patients living at home. MethodsThis cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} home care settings in Japan, involving 430 patients aged 65 or older, of whom 276 were female. All received regular home visits from five clinics between May and December 2013. After the PIMs were identified with the Screening Tool of Older Persons 2 ̆ 7 potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, we estimated the drug costs based on actual pharmaceutical prices and measured against <b>who</b> <b>using</b> nurse or pharmacist programs after a propensity score weighted adjustment. ResultsPatients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse programs had lower drug cost of PIMs than those <b>who</b> did not <b>use,</b> but it was not significantly different (5. 9 ± 13. 1 vs 7. 1 ± 13. 9 USD per month, P = 0. 199). The cost of PIMs for patients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> pharmacist programs also had no difference. (7. 2 ± 14. 5 vs 5. 5 ± 11. 5 USD per month, P = 0. 06). In the patient groups <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse programs, patients <b>who</b> also <b>used</b> pharmacist programs had significantly higher costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> <b>used</b> only nurse programs (5. 5 ± 13. 9 vs 2. 5 ± 6. 0 USD per month, P = 0. 006). In patients group <b>who</b> did not <b>use</b> pharmacist programs, patients <b>who</b> only <b>used</b> nurse programs had significantly lower costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> did not <b>use</b> nurse programs (3. 6 ± 7. 7 vs 5. 8 ± 12. 7 USD per month, P = 0. 022). ConclusionsPatients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse program have a trend towards lower drug costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse and pharmacist program or pharmacist program alone. Although this study tried to adjust the potential confounders as possible as we could by using propensity score analysis, further studies are needed to confirm our results...|$|R
