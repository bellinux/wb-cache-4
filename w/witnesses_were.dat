5|$|Ao Man-long stood {{trial in}} Macau on 5 November 2007, facing 30 years in prison. Given Ao's status of Government Secretary (equivalent to Minister), he was tried {{directly}} in the Court of Final Appeal of the Macau SAR. Over one hundred <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> called to testify.|$|E
5|$|Five {{defendants}} were then indicted for stealing £50 {{from the house}} of Robert Edwards in Ely. Mr Gurney addressed the jury at length describing the events occurring {{in the town of}} Ely {{on the morning of the}} 23 May 1816. Eight <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> called. The jury returned guilty verdicts against Dennis, Jefferson, and Rutter. Hopkin and Cammell were given not guilty verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} {{afternoon}} Burke and McDougal {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder of Docherty. The first <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> then called from a list of 55 that included Hare and Knox; not all the witnesses on the list were called and Knox, with three of his assistants, avoided being questioned in court. One of Knox's assistants, David Paterson—who had been the main person Burke and Hare had dealt with at Knox's surgery—was called and confirmed the pair had supplied the doctor with several corpses.|$|E
50|$|The {{general rule}} <b>is</b> that a <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> {{not allowed to}} testify about, nor may another <b>witness</b> <b>be</b> called to support, a {{previous}} consistent statement.|$|R
25|$|The {{court did}} not err in refusing to order {{production}} of a defense alibi witness, where the defense contended that the <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> under subpoena but no evidence was introduced {{to show that the}} <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> under subpoena, and no evidence was introduced to show the <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> ever served with a subpoena to testify.|$|R

5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who {{confirmed}} that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit {{on the head with}} a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
5|$|The next {{largest group}} of victims were non-Jewish Poles, who {{accounted}} for 70,000 to 75,000 deaths. Twenty-one thousand Roma and Sinti were killed, along with 15,000 Soviet POWs and 10,000 to 15,000 peoples of other nations. Around 400 Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts between men) were detained in concentration camps of which an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.|$|E
5|$|Then nine {{defendants}} {{were charged with}} threatening W. Cooper of Ely and stealing from him. Mr Gurney addressed the jury, explaining {{the circumstances of the}} disturbances carried out by the mob in Ely. Nine <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> called. Mr Justice Abbott spoke to the jury for a long time. The jury retired for fifteen minutes. On returning, it pronounced as guilty Dennis, Jessop, Atkin, Layton, Hobbs, Pricke, Cooper, and Jefferson. It acquitted Freeman.|$|E

5000|$|The {{testimony}} of two <b>witnesses</b> <b>is</b> equal in its {{force to the}} {{testimony of}} three or more witnesses. Thus if two witnesses say an event occurred, and one hundred witnesses say it did not occur, the groups of <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> considered to contradict one another, but no more weight {{is given to the}} larger group; other evidence is needed to reach a judgment. If one of the <b>witnesses</b> <b>is</b> disqualified, his entire group is disqualified, even if the other <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> themselves qualified and could present a valid testimony without his assistance.

5|$|In 1994, Croatian {{authorities}} tried Đuro Đurić, {{a former}} SAO Krajina policeman, in absentia {{on charges of}} war crimes committed in Struga, Zamlača and Kozibrod. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} twenty years in prison. Đurić surrendered to the Croatian police at the border crossing in Dvor in 2001. After two months in custody, he was released and left the country. Đurić returned to Croatia in February 2009, when he was arrested once again on identical charges. One month later, he was released after <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> questioned and failed to link him to the war crimes of which he was accused.|$|E
5|$|Over 168 {{news and}} {{television}} crews {{from around the}} world were on hand to report the execution, which was set up inside a warehouse at Utah State Prison in Draper. Nine media <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> allowed to record the actual event. Actor and activist Mike Farrell appeared as a commentator for the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to the death penalty. Elliott King, the uncle of Charla King, was the sole member of the victim's family to arrive as a witness and expressed that he had no sympathy for Taylor. Sister Helen Prejean, the author of Dead Man Walking, wrote Taylor a letter that was delivered right before his execution.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review {{the merits of the}} decision and conclude whether Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> a threat to public order, it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with the view that the existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. The judge also remarked that notion of public peace, welfare and good order in the SA was similar to the concept of public order envisaged by Article 15(4) of the Constitution. Thus the rationale of maintaining public order behind Order 179 fell within the permitted categories spelt out in both section 24(1)(a) of the SA and Article 15(4) respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of her purchaser is not known, nor are her activities after her sale, but Ozark {{was still in}} service in late 1873 and based at New Orleans. Louisiana governor William Pitt Kellogg used the ship to transport 35 soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment and 25 mounted members of the New Orleans Metropolitan Police to Colfax, Louisiana in October to apprehend the perpetrators of the Colfax Massacre. Due to widespread resistance by local whites, only a few men were arrested and transported to New Orleans by Ozark to stand trial in December. Prosecution <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> transported and housed in the ship during the trials in February–March 1874 {{to protect them from}} threats made by white supremacists. Nothing further is known about the Ozarks activities or fate.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry was {{launched}} on 31 May 2001, and was {{split into two}} phases: phase one and phase two. Phase one investigated the involvement of people and agencies in Climbié's death, {{in the form of}} hearings. Two hundred and seventy <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> involved. The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. Phase two of the inquiry, taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, took the form of five seminars, which looked at the child protection system in general. It was chaired by Garnham and brought together experts in all aspects of child protection.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Mazurkiewicz wrote {{a letter}} to Stanisław Radkiewicz, head of the Ministry of Public Security, {{complaining}} of the continued persecution of former Home Army soldiers and he was arrested again. During a two-year pre-trial confinement, Mazurkiewicz was interrogated and tortured—he was beaten and his teeth and hair were forcibly pulled out. He was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in a show trial, in which the prosecutor submitted a false confession allegedly made by Mazurkiewicz and no defense <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> allowed to appear. He remained imprisoned until the amnesty of 1956. Eventually rehabilitated, he was active in organizations which sought to protect former veterans of anti-Nazi resistance and served as vice-president of the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy, the Polish veterans association. In 1980, during a brief liberalization associated with the first Solidarity period he was promoted to the rank of General.|$|E
5|$|NC1 was {{the first}} to be sentenced, on 28 February 1990, after {{pleading}} guilty to having sex with someone under the age of consent. He was given six months' custody in a detention centre, the maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence. Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal, said it was likely that prosecutors did not charge NC1 with rape, as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely {{due to a lack of}} evidence; Leigh's complaints about the incident as reported by <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> hearsay and therefore inadmissible in court. On 11 May the sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours' community service. In reducing his sentence the judge stated the evidence obliged him to find that the sex was consensual, and that it was better for NC1 to do something positive for the community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody. A number of sources state the judge reached the conclusion that the sex had been consensual because of the inadequate way the evidence was presented to the court.|$|E
5|$|None of the Commission's {{recommendations}} {{ever made}} it into law under the Rump Parliament, though the Commission did produce 16 bills. Several were read in the House of Commons, and the remainder given to the Parliamentary Law Committee in July 1652 following the Committee's dissolution on 23 July. The Rump Parliament's successor, the Barebone's Parliament, brought two of the Commission's suggestions (to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) into force through statutes. Most of the Commission's suggestions were, at some point, followed. In 1837 {{the use of the}} death penalty was curtailed, and it was finally abolished in 1969. From 1702 onwards, <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> allowed for the defence, and the Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836 allowed legal representation for the defendants. The use of peine forte et dure was abolished in 1741, and the benefit of clergy in 1827. A permanent Law Commission was finally established with the Law Commissions Act 1965. County Courts were finally established in 1846, and a Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907.|$|E
50|$|The Pharisees posit that false <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{executed}} if {{the verdict}} is pronounced {{on the basis of}} their testimony—even if not yet actually carried out.

5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital. Taylor, recognizing that the slightest incident could lead to violence, ordered the men home, {{and many of them}} complied. Still, two or three hundred remained, awaiting the election committee's findings. Others remained as witnesses set to testify before the contest committee. Some of these Republican <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> arrested by local police, who were mostly Goebel partisans. Governor Taylor issued pardons for some of them, citing their claims that the police robbed them upon their arrest. To avoid arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, many of the Republican partisans began wearing their guns openly, adding to the tensions in the city, but effectively reducing the number of arrests by local police.|$|E
5|$|Having visited Bath, in {{the hope}} its waters would aid conception, Queen Mary became {{pregnant}} in late 1687. When the pregnancy became public knowledge shortly before Christmas, Catholics rejoiced. Protestants, who had tolerated James's Catholic government {{because he had no}} Catholic heir, were concerned. The Protestant disillusion came to a head after the child was known to be male, and many Protestants believed the child was spurious; if not, James II's Catholic dynasty would have been perpetuated. Popular opinion alleged that the child, named James Francis Edward, was smuggled into the birth chamber as a substitute to the Queen's real but stillborn child. This rumour was widely accepted as fact by Protestants, despite the many witnesses of the birth. Mainly by mismanagement on James' part, these rumours had some excuse as from personal prejudice he had excluded many from the ceremony whose testimony must have been counted valid; most of the <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> Catholics or foreigners, and several, such as the Princess Anne of Denmark, later to be Queen Anne, and the Protestant prelates, or the family of the Princesses whom the new birth would remove from the direct succession, were not allowed to be present. Anne later answered a memorandum of 18 questions regarding James Francis Edward's birth for her sister, the Princess of Orange. Anne's answers, biased and unreliable, convinced the Princess of Orange that her father had thrust a changeling upon the nation. Count Zuylestein, returning to the Netherlands shortly after the birth, agreed with Anne's findings.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the attackers}} {{seem to have}} wanted to force the Jews to convert, {{although}} they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, {{did their best to}} protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home. The attacks on the Jews were witnessed by Ekkehard of Aura and Albert of Aix; among the Jewish communities, the main contemporary <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> the Mainz Anonymous, Eliezer ben Nathan, and Solomon bar Simson.|$|E
50|$|In its {{original}} meaning, the word martyr, meaning <b>witness,</b> <b>was</b> {{used in the}} secular sphere {{as well as in}} the New Testament of the Bible.
