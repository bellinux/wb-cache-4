On the one hand, with a view to the emotional charge that is created when <b>we</b> <b>sense</b> the similarity of all human beings inside their nest.

The Theory of Forms and the principles of the unwritten doctrines fit together in a way that provides a unified theory of all existence. The existence of the Forms as well as therefore of the objects <b>we</b> <b>sense</b> are derived from two fundamental principles.|$|E

500|$|Many {{critics have}} {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} the religious themes in the poem. Vincent Bucklet stated that the Four Quartets [...] "presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance. The whole work is, in fact, the most authentic example I know in modern poetry of a satisfying religio-poetic meditation. <b>We</b> <b>sense</b> throughout it is not merely a building-up of an intricate poetic form on the foundation of experiences already over and done with, but a constant energy, an ever-present activity, of thinking and feeling." [...] In his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in British poetry, M H Abrams claimed, [...] "Even after a quarter-century, T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets has not lost its status as a strikingly 'modern' poem; its evolving meditations, however, merely play complex variations upon the design and motifs of Romantic representation of the poets educational progress." ...|$|E

It employs computer-generated animation as an aid to traditional techniques, rather than as a substitute for them, and <b>we</b> <b>sense</b> the touch of human artists in the vision behind the Egyptian monuments, the lonely desert vistas, the thrill of the chariot race, the personalities of the characters. This is a film that shows animation growing up and embracing more complex themes, instead of chaining itself in the category of children's entertainment." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine gave a negative review of the film saying, [...] "The film lacks creative exuberance, any side pockets of joy." [...] Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post praised the film saying, [...] "The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable." ...|$|E

Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is [...] "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the Boston Herald and Siona LaFrance of the New Orleans Times-Picayune both rated the best Buffy episodes giving [...] "The Body" [...] equal billing at the top with [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Once More, with Feeling", LaFrance designating the episode an [...] "instant classic". Jonathan Last in The Weekly Standard lists [...] "The Body" [...] eighth out of the ten best Buffy episodes, writing that it is [...] "the series' most difficult episode because it's real—and not real in the way ER or The Practice or Law & Order, all hyper-versions of reality, are real. At some point, {{most of us will}} experience a day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and <b>we</b> <b>sense</b> that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down to the absence of a musical score—right." [...] In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the vomit on the carpet. He does, however, write that some of the shots [...] "come off a little gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times.

40|$|Stories and causal {{theories}} {{are examples of}} two rather different ways that <b>we</b> make <b>sense</b> of the world.

Good art dwells with the particular in a way that connects with the audience. We see it and we understand in a way that allows us to understand our world a little differently, a little more. That understanding tends to be embodied, felt, and individual. In contrast, good science offers us a generalized theory that explains how some aspect of the world works in a cognitive, intellectual way. Artistic sensemaking is divergent, subjective, and embraces contradiction and paradox. Scientific sensemaking is convergent, objective, and strives for reliability and validity. Artistic forms seek essence. Scientific forms seek prediction and control...|$|R

For Plato, the Forms, not the objects of sense, are real Being: strictly, they and not the objects we experience are reality. Thus the Forms are the really existing things.

According to the [...] "transcendental unity of apperception", the concepts of the mind (Understanding) and the perceptions or intuitions that garner information from phenomena (Sensibility) are synthesized by comprehension.
