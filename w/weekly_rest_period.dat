25|$|A regular <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> is {{a period}} of at least 45 {{consecutive}} hours. An actual working week starts {{at the end of a}} <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period,</b> and finishes when another <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> is commenced, which may mean that weekly rest is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday–Sunday) week. This is perfectly acceptable – the working week is not required to be aligned with the ‘fixed’ week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent period of rest taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question. The compensating rest must be attached to a period of rest of at least 9 hours – in effect either a weekly or a daily rest period.|$|E
25|$|For example, where {{a driver}} reduces a <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> to 33 hours in week 1, he must {{compensate}} for this by attaching a 12-hour period of rest to another rest period {{of at least}} 9 hours {{before the end of}} week 4. This compensation cannot be taken in several smaller periods. A <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> that falls in two weeks may be counted in either week but not in both.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a vehicle}} is manned {{by two or}} more drivers, each driver must have a daily rest period of at least 9 {{consecutive}} hours within the 30-hour period that starts {{at the end of}} the last daily or <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, a <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> of {{at least}} 69 hours in total may be counted as two {{back-to-back}} <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> (e.g. a 45-hour <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> followed by 24 hours), provided that the driver does not exceed 144 hours’ work either {{before or after the}} <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> in question. Where reduced <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>periods</b> are taken away from base, these may be taken in a vehicle, provided that it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|R
50|$|<b>Weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>periods</b> (Art. 153 of the LC RF) {{constitute}} 2 {{consecutive days}} (48 hours) in a 5-day working week. When calculated, the rest shall amount {{to at least}} 36 hours between the weekly working period. If the accumulated calculation of working time refers to shift work, the rest must not be shorter than 24 hours.|$|R
50|$|Such advocates {{assert that}} the {{ratification}} and enforcement of ILO C189 would mean that migrant domestic workers would enjoy the same labour rights as other more 'masculine' fields {{as well as the}} citizens of their destination countries. An incomplete list of basic rights guaranteed by ILO C189 under Article 7 includes: maximum working hours; fixed minimum wages; paid leave; provision of food and accommodation; and <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>periods.</b> Guaranteeing these rights to migrant domestic workers would not constitute repayment the embodied debt owed to them, but they are entitled to these rights as they are both workers and human beings.|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} where, {{during each}} period of driving between any two consecutive daily rest periods, or between a daily rest period and a <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period,</b> {{there are at}} least two drivers in the vehicle to do the driving. For the first hour of multi-manning the presence of another driver or drivers is optional, but for the remainder of the period it is compulsory. This allows for a vehicle to depart from its operating centre and collect a second driver along the way, providing that this is done within 1 hour of the first driver starting work.|$|E
25|$|The daily {{driving time}} shall not exceed 9 hours. The daily driving {{time may be}} {{extended}} to at most 10 hours not more than twice during the week. The weekly driving time may not exceed 56 hours. In addition to this, a driver cannot exceed 90 hours driving in a fortnight. Within each period of 24 hours {{after the end of}} the previous daily rest period or <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> a driver must take a new daily rest period. An 11-hour (or more) daily rest is called a regular daily rest period. Alternatively, a driver can split a regular daily rest period into two periods. The first period must be at least 3 hours of uninterrupted rest and can be taken at any time during the day. The second must be at least 9 hours of uninterrupted rest, giving a total minimum rest of 12 hours. A driver may reduce his daily rest period to no less than 9 continuous hours, but this can be done no more than three times between any two weekly rest periods; no compensation for the reduction is required. A daily rest that is less than 11 hours but at least 9 hours long is called a reduced daily rest period. When a daily rest is taken, this may be taken in a vehicle, as long as it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|E
25|$|The Standard Unified Contract is a {{contract}} between the Employer and the migrant domestic worker. It was {{drawn up by}} The Ministry of Labour {{and it is the}} main source of the worker’s rights. The right for a clean and private place in which to relax in their free time. Also, clean and appropriate clothes, and sufficient food (Article 8). The right to medical care when needed, including dental and eye care, the costs of which should be met by the employer. The workers are covered by health insurance in the case of emergency (Article 9). The right to work for ten non-consecutive hours every day with frequent short breaks, and at least eight continuous hours of rest at night (Article 11). The right for a <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> of 24 hours, and deciding which day in the week is to be discussed between the worker and the employer (Article 12). The right for annual leave consists of 6 days also the dates should be discussed between the employer and the worker (Article 12). The right for a return ticket {{at the end of the}} contract (Article 13). The right for one phone call every month on the charge of the employer (Article 14). The right for sick leave when there is a medical report, half a month with pay and half a month with half pay (Article 15). There is no stipulation in the contract for any free legal assistance for the domestic workers.|$|E

40|$|The Working Hours Act {{regulates the}} working time {{conditions}} and {{together with the}} Working Time Directive of EU both acts aim to protect the workers. However, with The Swedish Model {{it is possible to}} diverge from the law-regulations by collective agreement by the parts of the Swedish labor market. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the national and international law regulations and further on study a few selected Swedish central collective agreements to discover in which extension deviation from the law occur. The sections of the Working Hours Act’s that has been investigated is ordinary working time, daily <b>rest,</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> <b>periods,</b> breaks and maximum weekly working time. To do this, a jurisprudential method has been used. The examination shows that agreements made by the parts of the labor market highly differentiate from Swedish law. This is due to adjustments to local conditions and flexible purposes. This effects the workers as the terms of their working hours can be found in different documents, international or Swedish law as well as in central or local collective agreements. Another effect of the deviation from the law is that the workers-organizations receive a great amount of power and influence of the workers working-conditions. They are responsible for negotiating for all the workers, whether they are members in the workers-organization or not. The Working Hours Act and the Work Environment Act have strong connections and the Swedish Working Environment Authority {{is currently working on a}} provision regarding the organizational and social working conditions. If it will be approved later this year it may influence the upcoming collective agreements. However, as of today, there is no assurance that the provision will be accepted. The possibility to replace the Working Hours Act by central collective agreements affects the protective intentions of the law. Instead of being confirmed in national law it is regulated in the collective agreements and therefore the protection of the workers varies depending on what sector they work...|$|R

40|$|U jednom industrijskom poduzeću izvršena je analiza distribucije periodiciteta tjednih odmora u tri periode vremena. Grupa radnika, prema kojoj smo uzimali podatke, radi u sve tri smjene i nema tjedni odmor u nedjelju nego u bilo koji dan u tjednu. Kod te grupe radnika utvrđeno je neperiodska distribucija tjednih odmora i produženi radni tjedan. Ta pojava utjecala je na povišenje drugih oblika apsentizma i vjerojatno na pogoršanje kvalitete proizvodnje pa i na druge pojave. The {{distribution}} of periodicity of <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> {{and its consequences}} have been studied in a factory operating in three shifts, where the <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> do not take place on Sundays, hut are spread all over the week including Sunday. This analysis has shown as follows: 1. 	The <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> are usually granted either successively or after {{a longer period of}} time, i. e. the <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> are not granted periodically and the {{distribution of}} periodicity of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> is rather large (δ = 5, 97). 2. 	The <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> are not granted as they ought to be, so that the average labour week is longer than it is justified or permitted. The average <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> takes place every 9, 02 day. 3. 	The <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> are not planned equally, so that the number of workers having <b>weekly</b> <b>rest</b> varies greatly from day to day. i. e. there is a huge daily variation Ln the total number of workers having <b>weekly</b> <b>rest.</b> 4. 	Variations of the total amount of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> on different days are not caused by any other form of absenteeism. 5. 	Variations in the number of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> represent the major part of the total of variations of all forms of absenteeism. 6. 	The <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> take place on the days when the other forms of absenteeism are most frequent. 7. 	The above mentioned distribution of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> 2 ̆ 7 increases the number of accidents at work. On an average, the accidents at work take place 6. 31 days after the previous <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> (M = 6, 31). 8. 	The above mentioned distribution of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> is likely to cause a lower quality of production and considerable financial losses. 9. 	This distribution of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> probably influences the increase of other forms of absenteeism and exerts a negative influence on working morale. In order to improve the existing state, the following measures are recommended: 1. 	To introduce an efficient recording of all the forms of absenteeism and other relating data. 2. 	To schedule the <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> so as to distribute them equally, in equal periods of time. 3. 	To inform the workers about the scheduled days of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests.</b> 4. 	To schedule the distribution of annual vacation {{in order to make the}} equal distribution of <b>weekly</b> <b>rests</b> possible...|$|R

The maximum driving time for a two-man crew taking advantage of this concession is 20 hours before a daily rest is required (although only if both drivers are entitled to drive 10 hours). Under multi-manning, the ‘second’ driver in a crew may not necessarily be the same driver fromthe duration of the first driver’s shift but could in principle be any number of drivers as long as the conditions are met. Whether these second drivers could claim the multi-manning concession in these circumstances would depend on their other duties. On a multi-manning operation the first 45 minutes of a period of availability will be considered to be a break, so long as the co-driver does no work.|$|E
