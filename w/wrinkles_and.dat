5|$|The {{shell of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and the aperture is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the shaggy, scaly, or woolly chanterelle, is a cantharelloid mushroom of the family Gomphaceae native to Asia and North America. It was known as Gomphus floccosus until 2011, when it {{was found to be}} only distantly related to the genus's type species, G.clavatus. It was consequently transferred from Gomphus to Turbinellus. The orange-capped vase- or trumpet-shaped fruiting bodies may reach 30cm (12in) high and 30cm (12in) wide. The lower surface, the hymenium, is covered in <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> ridges rather than gills or pores, and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – <b>Wrinkling</b> <b>and</b> {{fracture}} are {{the important}} defects in deep drawing operation, {{which can be}} prevented using blank holding force (BHF) which has to be optimized as lower BHF promotes <b>wrinkles</b> formation <b>and</b> higher BHF promotes fracturing. Hence the limits of <b>wrinkling</b> <b>and</b> fracture have to be established. These limits depend on various tooling and process parameters. In this work the effect of tooling parameters like die corner radius and punch corner radius on <b>wrinkling</b> <b>and</b> fracture limits are investigated using a finite element explicit solver LS-DYNA. Constant BHF is considered for analysis...|$|R

25|$|Because of its {{popularity}} after {{being introduced to}} North America in the 1970s, the breed suffered much inexperienced or rushed breeding. This resulted in not only a dramatically different look for the Shar-Pei (as its most distinctive features, including its <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> rounded snout, were greatly exaggerated), but also {{a large number of}} health problems. The American breed club states that few Shar Peis make it to age 10 and has a longevity program that records dogs that live 10 years or more.|$|E
25|$|To prevent <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> other problems, {{the fabric}} must be stabilized. The method of {{stabilizing}} {{depends on the}} type of machine, the fabric type, and the design density. For example, knits and large designs typically require firm stabilization. There are many methods for stabilizing fabric, but most often one or more additional pieces of material called stabilizers or interfacing are added beneath or on top of the fabric, or both. Stabilizer types include cut-away, tear-away, solvy water-soluble, heat-n-gone, filmoplast, and open mesh, sometimes in various combinations.|$|E

25|$|The {{operating}} room (OR) {{time required to}} harvest, refine, and emplace fat to the breasts {{is greater than the}} usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2-hours for the first 100cm3 volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100cm3 volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the plastic surgeon great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of tuberous breast deformity. In which case, no fat-graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with subcutaneously emplaced body-fat, immediately beneath the skin. Such controlled contouring selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation {{to the size of the}} nipple-areola complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected, breast-implant deformities, were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and capsular contracture, achieved with subcutaneous fat-grafts that hid the implant-device edges and <b>wrinkles,</b> <b>and</b> decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant. Furthermore, grafting autologous fat around the breast implant can result in softening the breast capsule.|$|E

500|$|Gomphus clavatus, {{commonly}} known as pig's ears or the violet chanterelle, is an edible species of fungus in the genus Gomphus native to Eurasia and North America. The fruit body is vase- or fan-shaped with wavy edges to its rim, and grows up to [...] wide and [...] tall. The upper surface or cap is orangish-brown to lilac, while the lower spore-bearing surface, the hymenium, is covered in <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> ridges rather than gills or pores, and is a distinctive purple color. Described by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774, G.clavatus has had several name changes and many alternative scientific names, having been classified as a chanterelle by several authorities, {{though it is not}} closely related to them.|$|E

The flesh is whitish to pale yellow, and has a brittle texture. On {{the underside of the}} cap, the pore surface is white to yellowish, sometimes with olive or tan tinges. There are roughly two circular pores per millimeter, and the tubes that comprise the pores are [...] deep, but depressed around the top of the stem. Injury to the pores will cause them to stain first greenish yellow, then greenish blue or blue.|$|E

The outer surface is a bright reddish-tan-brown with a purplish hint, often covered in tiny, downy hairs of a grey colour. It can be smooth, as is typical of younger specimens, or undulating with folds and wrinkles. The colour becomes darker with age. The inner surface is a lighter grey-brown in colour and smooth.

500|$|Calvatia craniiformis, {{commonly}} known as the brain puffball or the skull-shaped puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. It is found in Asia, Australia, and North America, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Its name, derived from the same Latin root as cranium, alludes to its resemblance to an animal's brain. The skull-shaped fruit body is [...] broad by [...] tall and white to tan. Initially smooth, the skin (peridium) develops <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> folds as it matures, cracking and flaking with age. The peridium eventually sloughs away, exposing a powdery yellow-brown to greenish-yellow spore mass (the gleba). The puffball is edible when the gleba is still white and firm, before it matures to become yellow-brown and powdery. Mature specimens have been used in the traditional or folk medicines of China, Japan, and the Ojibwe as a hemostatic or wound dressing agent. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the brain puffball.|$|E
500|$|A {{characteristic}} of the brain is gyrification (wrinkling of the cortex). In the womb, the cortex starts off as smooth but starts to form fissures that begin to mark out the different lobes of the brain. Scientists {{do not have a}} clear answer as to why the cortex later <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> folds, but the wrinkling and folding is associated with intelligence and neurological disorders. The fissures form {{as a result of the}} growing hemispheres that increase in size due to a sudden growth in cells of the grey matter. The underlying white matter does not grow at the same rate and the hemispheres are crowded into the small cranial vault. The first cleft to appear in the fourth month is the lateral cerebral fossa. The expanding caudal end of the hemisphere has to curve over in a forward direction to fit into the restricted space. This covers the fossa and turns it into a much deeper ridge known as the lateral sulcus and this marks out the temporal lobe. By the sixth month other sulci have formed that demarcate the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. A gene present in the human genome (ArhGAP11B) may play a major role in gyrification and encephalisation.|$|E
500|$|The convex cap {{measures}} [...] wide. Its {{color is}} orange-yellow, aging to yellow-brown. The cap margin has a narrow flap of sterile tissue. The {{surface of the}} cap is dry, with <b>wrinkles</b> <b>and</b> pits at maturity. It often becomes cracked in age, and the whitish flesh underneath shows through. The cap tends to undergo significant color changes throughout its development—first bright yellow, then dark brown, then finally pale tan—which may {{make it difficult to}} identify in the field. The flesh is white to pale yellow, and it stains reddish to burgundy when cut or bruised. This staining is most prominent at the junction of the cap and the stipe. Further exposure over the course of 20–60 minutes results in the flesh becoming grayish to blackish. The flesh has no distinctive door or taste. The pore surface is initially dull yellow, and sometimes ages to dingy olive-brown. Unlike many other boletes, it does not turn blue when bruised, although it may have natural blue-green stains. The pores are circular, measuring less than 1mm, while the tubes extend to 8–14mm deep. The stipe measures [...] long by [...] thick. It is nearly equal in length throughout or tapered from the top to base. Its color is pale yellow to brownish underneath the pale brown scabers that darken in age.|$|E
