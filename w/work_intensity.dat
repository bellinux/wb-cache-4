5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, <b>work</b> <b>intensity</b> is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. <b>Work</b> <b>intensity</b> can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the <b>work</b> <b>intensity</b> by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of <b>work</b> <b>intensity,</b> where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{importance}} of individual differences cannot be ignored, scientific evidence suggests that certain working conditions are stressful to most people. Such evidence argues for {{a greater emphasis on}} working conditions as the key source of job stress, and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy. Large surveys of working conditions, including conditions recognized as risk factors for job stress, were conducted in member states of the European Union in 1990, 1995, and 2000. Results showed a time trend suggesting an increase in <b>work</b> <b>intensity.</b> In 1990, the percentage of workers reporting that they worked at high speeds at least one-quarter of their working time was 48%, increasing to 54% in 1995 and to 56% in 2000. Similarly, 50% of workers reported they work against tight deadlines at least one-fourth of their working time in 1990, increasing to 56% in 1995 and 60% in 2000. However, no change was noted in the period 1995–2000 (data not collected in 1990) in the percentage of workers reporting sufficient time to complete tasks.|$|E
500|$|Poor {{families}} {{are much more}} constrained in their economic ability to [...] "buy back" [...] lost time through the market. Instead of buying market substitutes, they try {{to meet their needs}} without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a time.

50|$|<b>Work</b> <b>Intensity</b> {{is defined}} as {{activity}} {{in relation to the}} capacity for that work. It is a topic that affects developed and developing countries in different ways.

Multitasking is the overlap of many activities, usually care and informal work, that negatively impacts the livelihood of people, especially women, in the developing world.

5000|$|Because of {{the time}} and {{workload}} associated with <b>work</b> <b>intensity,</b> there is a negative correlation between <b>work</b> <b>intensity</b> and health. [...] While these health patterns occur in the developing and developed worlds, they manifest differently. An increase in work hours and multitasking may lead to higher monetary income and completed household tasks (for example, meals are cooked, clothes are washed, children are cared for), however the way in which women workers spend their time can lead to a deterioration in health due to stress, chronic fatigue, and a lack of recreation and sleep. In addition, working long hours in agriculture and in factories can cause nutritional deficiencies and physical strain. [...] Lower classes tend to bear the burden of the negative health implications associated with <b>work</b> <b>intensity,</b> and {{they are more likely to}} take undesirable jobs that cause said health problems.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relationships between heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO 2) and mechanical Peak crank torque (PCT) and Average crank torque (ACT 60) variables in response to submaximal exercise employing a cycling race ergometer (RE), treadmill cycling (TC) and cycling in the field (FC). The <b>work</b> <b>intensities</b> identified as sub LT, LT and supra LT were equated on the basis of HR. Voltage signals from the crank arm were recorded as FM signals for subsequent representation of peak crank force (PCT) and average crank torque (ACT 60). Field VO 2 measures were done by Douglas bag procedure while an open circuit method was used for all laboratory testing. Heart rates were recorded with a Polar Electro Sport Tester PE 3000. The observed results of field cycling demonstrated that laboratory conditions would overestimate the oxygen consumption in the field while force measurements suggested that laboratory conditions would underestimate mechanical work expenditures in the field. These differences become reduced at <b>work</b> <b>intensities</b> approximating VO 2 max. It was concluded that HR can not always be used as an indicator of work stress when attempting to equate similar work loads performed under different conditions. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

5000|$|Of {{the poverty}} {{eradication}} policies currently in place, {{very few of}} them incorporate <b>work</b> <b>intensity</b> into their reduction strategies and can often actually worsen conditions for citizens of developing countries. A common development strategy is to increase the size of a plot of land used for agriculture. While this increases a family’s output, it also increases the amount of work women have to do. [...] Another example would be moving a water source closer to a village. While women spend less time collecting water, their free time is rarely allocated to leisure and is instead allocated to more work that can often be more strenuous than the initial task of water collecting. The two development projects listed above are common in developing countries, however neither takes time poverty nor multitasking into account. A potential solution to these two problems is to include improved nutritional programs when <b>work</b> <b>intensity</b> increases. This way, women aren’t forced to choose between more work and more food as the nutrition program will be improved as <b>work</b> <b>intensity</b> increases.

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of <b>work</b> <b>intensity</b> and multitasking, women tend to be more {{affected}} than men. <b>Work</b> <b>intensity</b> is amplified by multitasking as women put forth more effort per unit of time through the performance of two or more tasks simultaneously. Women assume productive, reproductive, and managing roles in their communities, thus the demand for their time is greater. Each role requires a different amount of intensity, and the magnitude of the amount of work that women in the developing world complete is often disregarded. Current time use data and research ignores the multiplicity of roles and duties performed by women in developing nations, thus, the extent in which women multitask is vastly underreported. This creates an unfair distribution of work between men and women as women chiefly deal with the functioning of the familial unit.|$|E

Many economists want to tangibly see the reallocation of work after a certain labor-saving technology has been incorporated. However, individuals need time to recover and thus rest is as important as physical work. A big issue facing policymakers is the inadequacy of the way gender equality and time use are currently measured. Two current methods to quantify gender equality are the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM).
