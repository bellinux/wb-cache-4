500|$|C. L. R. James {{described}} St Hill as [...] "about {{six feet}} {{or a little}} under, slim, wiry, with forearms like <b>whipcord.</b> His face was bony, with small sharp eyes and a thin, tight mouth." [...] A reserved man, Hill kept his opinions to himself. Off the cricket field, James described him as partial to the [...] "good things of life".|$|E
2500|$|Louis [...] "Swampy" [...] Graves, a Texarkana Gazette {{reporter}} in 1946, described Gonzaullas as {{a handsome man}} {{with a lot of}} personality. [...] "He was well-built and wore a <b>whipcord</b> suit and a battle jacket with bright buttons. He was very clean looking, with an olive complexion, and wore pearl-handled pistols, one on each hip. He looked like a typical Texas Ranger," [...] said Graves. [...] "He would have been perfect in the Old West. He fit the description going around in those years about the number of Texas Rangers needed to quell a riot. One Riot, One Texas Ranger." ...|$|E
60|$|Streuss {{struck the}} table before which they were standing. The veins in his temples were like <b>whipcord.</b>|$|E
50|$|The cord form of <b>whipcording</b> is also {{sometimes}} called Interlocking. It {{is made by}} plaiting together four strands to make a stronger cord, usually using bobbins to weight the strands and make them easier to control. It can be worked as a solid color or in a stripe or a diagonal for a two color pattern.|$|R
60|$|So {{the cries}} and {{directions}} ran on, {{as the boat}} proceeded on her perilous voyage. The water was boiling on every side, and the lines which held the craft were as tight as <b>whipcords.</b> Considerable water had been shipped, and Earl was wet from head to foot. But he kept his place and shoved off, this way and that, with might and main.|$|R
60|$|Then--if {{the roof}} {{had fallen in}} upon him, Levi West {{could not have been}} more amazed--Hiram {{suddenly}} strode forward, and, leaning half across the table with his fists clenched, fairly glared into Levi's eyes. His face, dull, stupid, wooden, was now fairly convulsed with passion. The great veins stood out upon his temples like knotted <b>whipcords,</b> and when he spoke his voice was more a breathless snarl than the voice of a Christian man.|$|R
60|$|They {{left the}} room. Horser turned to Mr. Sabin, and the veins on his {{forehead}} stood out like <b>whipcord.</b>|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Jean {{caught a}} glint of moving color through the fringe of brush. Instantly he was strung like a <b>whipcord.</b>|$|E
60|$|Thorndyke was a florid and a puffy man. The veins {{upon his}} temples stood out like <b>whipcord.</b> He {{was not a}} {{pleasant}} sight to look upon.|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} lightly in both arms, her head resting above his left elbow. Ellen {{saw his face}} as a gray blur, then taking sharper outline, until it stood out distinctly, pale and clammy, with eyes cold and {{wonderful}} in their intense flare. As she gazed upward Colter {{turned his head to}} look back through the woods, and his motion betrayed a keen, wild vigilance. The veins of his lean, brown neck stood out like <b>whipcords.</b> Two comrades were stalking beside him. Ellen heard their stealthy steps, and she felt Colter sheer from one side or the other. They were proceeding cautiously, fearful of the rear, but not wholly trusting to the fore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shorty, I've got you skinned to death. I've reconstructed {{every cell}} {{in my body}} since I hit the beach at Dyea. My flesh is as stringy as <b>whipcords,</b> and as bitter and mean as the bite of a rattlesnake. A few months ago I'd have patted myself on the back to write such words, but I couldn't have written them. I had to live them first, and now that I'm living them there's no need to write them. I'm the real, bitter, {{stinging}} goods, and no scrub of a mountaineer can put anything over on me without getting it back compound. Now, {{you go ahead and}} set pace for half an hour. Do your worst, and when you're all in I'll go ahead and give you half an hour of the real worst." ...|$|R
50|$|The Giants and Big Heads {{are without}} a doubt {{one of the most}} beloved traditions for the people of Zaragoza. Giant costumed figures made of papier-mâché are made to look disproportionately big-headed, in the case of “cabezudos”, or huge like giants, in the case of “gigantes”. During the festival, the giants process daily around the streets, {{covering}} all areas of the city. There are ten “cabezudos”, with different names, and all of them wearing different costumes. The cabezudos depict well known local characters (such as “el Morico”, “el Boticario”, “el Robaculeros”, “el Torero”, “el Tuerto”, “el Forano”, “la Forana”, “el Verrugón”, “la Pilara” and el “Azutero”) and each of them has its own song. The cabezudos are teased by the children and teens, and they answer to this provocation by chasing them along the streets and hitting them gently with <b>whipcords.</b> The gigantes, or Giants, are a more formal part of the show, with a cast of regal and noble medieval and historic characters that entertain the people with their elegant dances in pairs. The current giants were designed in 1849 by the sculptor Felix Oroz.|$|R
60|$|The veins were {{standing}} out like <b>whipcord</b> on Granet's flushed forehead. He swayed on his feet. Twice he had {{seemed as though}} he would spring at his opponent.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{the veins}} in the Duke's {{forehead}} stand out like <b>whipcord.</b> He began a sentence {{and left it}} unfinished. He was in that condition when words are impotent.|$|E
60|$|Levasseur {{considered}} his victim, and beheld him tense and braced, his haggard {{face of a}} leaden hue, beads of perspiration glinting on his pallid brow just beneath the <b>whipcord.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Badawin of Al-Hijaz {{are short}} men, about {{the height of}} the Indians near Bombay, but {{weighing}} on an average a stone more. As usual in this stage of society, stature varies little; you rarely see a giant, and scarcely ever a dwarf. Deformity is checked by the Spartan restraint upon population, and no weakly infant can live through a Badawi life. The figure, though spare, is square and well knit; fulness of limb seldom appears but about spring, when milk abounds: I have seen two or three muscular figures, but never a fat man. The neck is sinewy, the chest broad, the flank thin, and the stomach in-drawn; the legs, though fleshless, are well made, especially when the knee and ankle are not bowed by too early riding. The shins do not bend cucumber-like to the front as in the African race.[FN#11] The arms are thin, with muscles like <b>whipcords,</b> and the hands and feet are, in point of size and delicacy, a link between Europe and India. As in the Celt, the Arab thumb is remarkably long, extending almost to the first joint of the index,[FN#12] which, with its easy rotation, makes it a perfect prehensile instrument: the palm also is fleshless, small-boned, and [p.84] elastic. With his small active figure, it is not strange that the wildest Badawi gait should be pleasing; he neither unfits himself for walking, nor distorts his ankles by turning out his toes according to the farcical rule of fashion, and his shoulders are not dressed like a drill-sergeant’s, to throw all the weight of the body upon the heels. Yet there is no slouch in his walk; it is light and springy, and errs only in one point, sometimes becoming a strut.|$|R
6000|$|Fishing-lines.--Twisted sinews {{will make}} a fishing-line. To make a strong fine line, unravel a good silk handkerchief, and twist the threads into a <b>whipcord.</b> (See also [...] "Substitutes for String.") ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I won't {{give him}} a case of murder to read,' muttered Sir Mulberry with an oath; 'but it shall be {{something}} very near it if <b>whipcord</b> cuts and bludgeons bruise.' ...|$|E
60|$|The old hag laughed hoarsely {{to herself}} until the scraggy sinews of her {{withered}} neck stood out like <b>whipcord.</b> She was still chuckling and coughing when the merchant {{came back into}} the room.|$|E
60|$|But {{drowning}} men {{clutch at}} straws. This was no moment to deliberate or reason. I would have trusted myself just then, broken leg and all, {{to a line}} of <b>whipcord,</b> if nothing else came handy.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Fentolin {{opened her}} lips once and closed them again. She laughed a little--a high-pitched, semi-hysterical laugh. The hand which gripped her fan was {{straining}} {{so that the}} blue veins stood out almost like <b>whipcord.</b>|$|E
60|$|The object {{which had}} {{caught his eye}} was a small dog lash hung on {{one corner of the}} bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of <b>whipcord.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Umph,' murmured Cristal betwixt his teeth. 'Close as wax, I see; {{and perhaps}} not quite so pliable. But take care, my pretty youth,' he added, scornfully; 'Hugh Redgauntlet will prove a rough colt-breaker--he will neither spare <b>whipcord</b> nor spur-rowel, I promise you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mother," [...] says he, {{with the}} <b>whipcord</b> in his mouth, and {{proceeding}} {{to wind up}} his sportive engine. [...] "You was a-saying that Harry was very poor now, and that we oughtn't to help him. That's what you was saying; wasn't it, madam?" ...|$|E
60|$|And now the panther {{was like}} a black, snake-like fury, blind with rage and {{unsatisfied}} lust, with tail lashing like a <b>whipcord</b> and yellow eyes that gleamed like tiny suns. His jaws were red and dripping, his claws had been torn by the same grapnels that had snatched his prey from him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say if not {{actually}} younger in days and years, you look more hardy and like <b>whipcord</b> than Jasper, {{or any of}} them; {{and there will be}} more of you, thirty years hence, than of all of them put together. A good conscience will keep one like you a mere boy all his life." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} opened. The man was still {{lying on the}} ground, but had rolled some {{distance}} from where they had left him. He had succeeded in getting his feet loosened from the handkerchief, but the <b>whipcord</b> round his wrists had resisted all his efforts to break or slacken it. He was panting heavily from the exertions he had made.|$|E
6000|$|... "So please your Excellency, {{to let me}} {{deal with}} him," [...] said Pearson, who was a true soldier of fortune, and had been a buccaneer in the West Indies, [...] "I think that, by a <b>whipcord</b> twitched tight round their forehead, and twisted about with a pistol-but, I could make either the truth start from their lips, or the eyes from their head." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{third of}} the hunters was a tall, slight figure, a man of about five and thirty, with muscles like <b>whipcord,</b> who could, if it were needed, go for 100 miles without a halt, and tire out the swiftest horse. In {{addition}} to these were ten natives, who assisted with the cattle, pitched the tent, cooked and skinned the game, and did other odd jobs.|$|E
60|$|She {{had slipped}} her knee already from the pummel, and slid down; the sheep-dogs were {{instantly}} on their hind-feet, propping themselves against her waist. Lennan held the black horse--a bizarre little beast, all fire and <b>whipcord,</b> with a skin like satin, liquid eyes, very straight hocks, {{and a thin}} bang-tail reaching down to them. The little creature had none of those commonplace good looks so discouraging to artists.|$|E
60|$|M. d'Ogeron looked on, a man bemused, {{unable to}} surmise what the issue either way could mean for him. Meanwhile, two of Blood's {{men who had}} taken {{the place of the}} Frenchman's negro guards, had removed the crown of <b>whipcord</b> from his brow. As for mademoiselle, she had risen, and was leaning forward, a hand pressed tightly to her heaving breast, her face deathly pale, a wild terror in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|He put {{one hand}} on the man's forearm and ran the other down the plump body beneath the coat. [...] "My goodness!" [...] said he to Torpenhow, [...] "and this gray oaf dares to be a thief! I have seen an Esneh {{camel-driver}} have the black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet dates, and he was as tough as <b>whipcord.</b> This thing's soft all over--like a woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you're like {{my brother}} Tom, Luke," [...] said Maggie, wishing {{to turn the}} {{conversation}} agreeably; [...] "Tom's not fond of reading. I love Tom so dearly, Luke,--better than {{anybody else in the}} world. When he grows up I shall keep his house, and we shall always live together. I can tell him everything he doesn't know. But I think Tom's clever, for all he doesn't like books; he makes beautiful <b>whipcord</b> and rabbit-pens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{foolish to}} persist." [...] Levasseur spoke without anger, with a coldly mocking regret. His fingers had been busy tying knots in {{a length of}} <b>whipcord.</b> He held it up. [...] "You know this? It is a rosary of pain that has wrought the {{conversion}} of many a stubborn heretic. It is capable of screwing the eyes out of a man's head by way of helping him to see reason. As you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, anyway, it's not for long," [...] growled the Colonel, finding {{speech at}} last. [...] "No, by....." [...] He {{emphasized}} the assurance by an unprintable oath. [...] "If I spend the last shilling of my fortune {{and the last}} ship of the Jamaica fleet, I'll have that rascal in a hempen necktie before I rest. And I'll not be long about it." [...] He had empurpled in his angry vehemence, and the veins of his forehead stood out like <b>whipcord.</b> Then he checked.|$|E
60|$|As for Captain Morgan, he {{went about}} his work with the utmost coolness and {{deliberation}} imaginable, unbuttoning the waistcoat and the shirt of the man he had murdered with fingers that neither twitched nor shook. There were a gold cross {{and a bunch of}} silver medals hung by a <b>whipcord</b> about the neck of the dead man. This Captain Morgan broke away with a snap, reaching the jingling baubles to Harry, who took them in his nerveless hand and fingers that he could hardly close upon what they held.|$|E
