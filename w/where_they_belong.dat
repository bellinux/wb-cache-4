Normal cells divide {{as many times as}} needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>belong,</b> and to die at the proper time.|$|E

Christian religious symbols such as crucifixes are visible to many Christian missionary schools. However, display of crucifixes to non-missionary schools are normally disallowed.|$|E

25|$|In the {{developing}} brain, neural stem cells must migrate from {{the areas where}} they are born to the areas where they will settle into their proper neural circuits. Neuronal migration, which occurs {{as early as the}} second month of gestation, is controlled by a complex assortment of chemical guides and signals. When these signals are absent or incorrect, neurons do not end up <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>belong.</b> This can result in structurally abnormal or missing areas of the brain in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus.|$|E

[...] Record Mirror awarded the album four stars out of five and Allen Evans of the NME also praised the LP: [...] "This is an exciting album, at times brash and noisy ('So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star', 'Have You Seen Her Face'), spooky (the science-fiction outer-space sounds on 'C.T.A.-102'), folksy ('Everybody's Been Burned'), weird (the irritating, monotonous backing to 'Mind Gardens'), and pleasant (the soft swinging of 'The Girl with No Name').

2500|$|The {{scheme is}} one of a number {{developed}} by Biodiversity Information Standards [...] particularly aimed at taxonomic databases. The starting point was the [...] "need for an agreed system of geographical units at approximately 'country' level and upwards for use in recording plant distributions". The scheme represents a compromise between political and botanical divisions. All boundaries either follow a political boundary (country boundary, province boundary, etc.), or coastlines. The scheme also aims to follow botanical tradition, in terms of the distribution categories used in works like the Flora Europaea, Flora Malesiana, or Med-Checklist. This approach occasionally leads to departures from political boundaries. Thus the scheme follows Flora Europaea in placing the eastern Aegean islands (such as Lesbos, Samos and Rhodes) in the West Asia region, rather than in Europe <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>belong</b> politically as part of Greece.|$|E
2500|$|The main characters, {{according}} to Hashino, share a mindset that they [...] "no {{longer have a}} place <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>belong</b> in society": {{the events of the}} game give them a sense of belonging. Hashino stated that while the last few titles were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, Persona 5 would feature more of the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during their activities. The characters have been described as [...] "juvenile academics". Their activities as thieves is part of the way they break way from societal norms and express themselves. The main aim of the game was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations. In contrast to previous Persona casts, the party of Persona 5 willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them. The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to a supporting role as part of the Confidant system. Technological advances such as smartphones and the use of social media were integrated into both story and gameplay due to its growing prevalence in modern society.|$|E
