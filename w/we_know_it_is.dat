500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Ordinary atomic {{matter as}} <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> really a mixed phase, {{droplets}} of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature phase boundary between vacuum and nuclear matter, at μ=310MeV and T close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase μ) keeping the temperature low, {{we move into}} a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a neutron star. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of μ, there is a transition to quark matter. At ultra-high densities we expect to find the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color-superconducting quark matter. At intermediate densities we expect some other phases (labelled [...] "non-CFL quark liquid" [...] in the figure) whose nature is presently unknown,. They might be other forms of color-superconducting quark matter, or something different.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Higgs {{field is}} non-zero {{everywhere}} {{and its effects}} ubiquitous, proving its existence was far from easy. In principle, it can be proved to exist by detecting its excitations, which manifest as Higgs particles (the Higgs boson), but these are extremely difficult to produce and to detect. The importance of this fundamental question led to a 40-year search, {{and the construction of}} one of the world's most expensive and complex experimental facilities to date, CERN's Large Hadron Collider, in an attempt to create Higgs bosons and other particles for observation and study. On 4 July 2012, the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and [...] was announced; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson.Q: 'If we don't know the new particle is a Higgs, {{what do we know about}} it?' <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> some kind of boson, says Vivek Sharma of CMS Q: 'are the CERN scientists just being too cautious?

2500|$|In a post-modern {{thesis on}} the superhero genre Michael Lecker wrote, [...] "In the superhero genre, clothes {{do the talking}} through semiotics, which [...] Barthes {{discusses}} in depth in his work: The 'first, literal message serves as a support for a second meaning, of a generally affective or ideological order' (Roland Barthes). The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that our society has projected onto cats and that the characters embody." [...] In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, [...] "Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not. Fetishism is used {{as an excuse for}} a bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather.

2500|$|The {{story of}} Titus Andronicus is fictional, not {{historical}}, unlike Shakespeare's other Roman plays, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus, {{all of which}} are based on real historical events and people. Even the time in which Titus is set may not be based on a real historical period. According to the prose version of the play (see below), the events are [...] "set in the time of Theodosius", who ruled from 379 to 395. On the other hand, the general setting appears to be what Clifford Huffman describes as [...] "late-Imperial Christian Rome", possibly during the reign of Justinian I (527–565). Also favouring a later date, Grace Starry West argues, [...] "the Rome of Titus Andronicus is Rome after Brutus, after Caesar, and after Ovid. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a later Rome because the emperor is routinely called Caesar; because the characters are constantly alluding to Tarquin, Lucretia, and Brutus, suggesting that they learned about Brutus' new founding of Rome from the same literary sources we do, Livy and Plutarch." [...] Others are less certain of a specific setting, however. For example, Jonathan Bate has pointed out that the play begins with Titus returning from a successful ten-year campaign against the Goths, as if {{at the height of the}} Roman Empire, but ends with Goths invading Rome, as if at its death. Similarly, T. J. B. Spencer argues that [...] "the play does not assume a political situation known to Roman history; it is, rather a summary of Roman politics. It is not so much that any particular set of political institutions is assumed in Titus, but rather that it includes all the political institutions that Rome ever had." ...|$|E
