5|$|With the Sporting Regulations {{amended to}} allow Honda to supply an extra engine without penalty, McLaren opted {{to use it}} in Hungary, where the tight {{confines}} of the Hungaroring and lower demands on outright power were expected to benefit the MP4-30. Despite further reliability problems preventing the car from reaching the final qualifying session as the team expected, both Button and Alonso expressed satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of the chassis and the team's development, describing it as their best weekend of the season. The team went on to record their first finish with both cars in the points after Alonso finished fifth and Button ninth, and the team went into the summer break with seventeen points, five points behind Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of {{a significant percentage of}} the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, even if they were low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound, {{known in}} Japan as , is a {{role-playing}} video game published by Nintendo for the Super NES video game console in 1994. Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka reprised their roles from Mother as composers for the game, and {{were joined by}} assistant composers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In an interview with Weekly Famitsu, Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the SNES gave the composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted than the NES, which made development of the music for EarthBound much easier than for its predecessor. This freedom was partially {{a result of the}} larger memory space available, because one of the many problems the composers had in the first game was trying to get all of their music on to the cartridge. Another advantage was that the SNES could support playing eight notes at the same time, which when combined with the increased sound quality meant that he could compose music for the game in a similar fashion to how he would compose music for real life. Suzuki cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed, as his songs about love matched up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of the game. Critics and players have noted similarities between parts of some songs in the game to popular songs, including several suspected homages to songs by Lennon and The Beatles. Legal issues surrounding these similarities were suspected to prevent the game from being released on the Virtual Console outside of Japan, but the rumors were ultimately proved untrue.|$|E

500|$|According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the {{emotional}} {{gulf between the}} state of his domestic affairs {{and the loss of}} his special friendship informs the reading of [...] "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem [...] "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, [...] "There is more about myself in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam." [...] Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.|$|E

[...] Jamieson Cox of Time and Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times agreed that the song is one of the album's highlights. Brennan Carley of Spin thought that the song [...] "revels convincingly in its vulnerability" [...] where as Lindsay Zoladz of New York cited [...] "Joan of Arc" [...] as one of the [...] "most affecting songs" [...] on the album for grappling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of being defeated and fatigued directly. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse was largely positive, declaring that the song [...] "is possibly Madonna’s best ballad since 'Miles Away'—or really since the Music or Ray of Light era." [...] On the other hand, Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen had mixed feelings about the song, calling it a [...] "lukewarm love [...] couples easy, inoffensive melodies with historical Christian imagery." [...] Further criticism came from Saeed Saeed of The National about the [...] "anaemic production", while The New Zealand Heralds Lydia Jenkin called it awfully pedestrian".|$|E

500|$|As writer Tim Burton's {{upbringing}} in Burbank, California {{was associated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. [...] "Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, [...] it was great. It gave you {{some sort of}} texture {{all of a sudden}} that wasn't there before", Burton would later recall. After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, Burton, who was then-employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas. Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children's book. [...] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed [...] "too weird" [...] to the company. As Disney was unable to [...] "offer his nocturnal loners enough scope", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984, and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice and Batman.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} {{development}} process as smooth as possible, Hataya tried {{to work in the}} same environment as Sasaki so that they could exchange data more efficiently. The main tools and software used during development were Digital Performer and Pro Tools, which, according to Hataya, were the standard tools used in music production. In order to stress that the atmosphere of Journey of Dreams was centred around surrealism and dreams themselves, Sasaki discarded tying the game's music down to a single genre and took the approach of not having a clear musical policy. Sasaki also ensured that each theme included the exhilaration of [...] "flying in the air", as it was a core element of gameplay. Hataya echoed that the music of the game was produced by focusing on being able to empathise <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of flying, as well as to exemplify the game's atmosphere and characters. Since the team were aware that Journey of Dreams had a greater sense of adventure than the original, the team knew that they could incorporate a larger variety of music into it so that players would enjoy a wider range of emotions. In addition to composing the music itself, Hataya took the responsibility of re-arranging Sasaki's music in different ways so that the theme matched the in-game situation. Hataya said that he and Sasaki produced around 70 percent of the game's music between them; the rest was produced by Sega's sound team.|$|E

Given our cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but once you get past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E

500|$|Following her {{positive}} comments, however, Battersby concludes negatively. The {{book is a}} [...] "bleak performance... a tired {{study of}} the vacuous" [...] <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of an improvised screenplay being performed by an uncommitted cast. She sums that Ellis' novel [...] "consists of too many doors being left slightly ajar, and not enough rooms, or opportunities, being fully explored." [...] Some critics have questioned the book's relevance to a contemporary audience. Dallas News poses the question, whether Imperial Bedrooms is [...] "a story anyone is interested in anymore", because Ellis' [...] "blunt, spare, journal-entry prose" [...] is no longer, in 2010, [...] "the backstage pass" [...] it once was {{to the lives of}} [...] "LA's rich and famous". Furthermore, Tom Maurstrad argues that since the 1980s, that decade has become a [...] "go-to bargain bin for retro-trends and ready-made nostalgia, easy to package into fashion lines and TV shows". The review bemoans that the novel's theme, the dark side of Hollywood, is no longer a culture-shocking revelation, and that Ellis fails to capitalize on the narratorial conceit which it opens with. Maurstrad does highlight positive aspects, however. Ellis wisely [...] "appropriates the unblinking brutality ... American Psycho, to add some dramatic heft to this anorexic update", making the sequel a [...] "celebrity snuff film" [...] to the earlier [...] "backstage pass". The Wall Street Journal damned the novel as [...] "a dull, stricken, under-medicated nonstory that goes nowhere."
