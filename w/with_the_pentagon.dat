25|$|In {{summer and}} autumn 1951, the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF's 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing—only 44 at one point—continued seeking battle in MiG Alley, where the Yalu River marks the Chinese border, against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of {{deploying}} some 500 aircraft. Following Colonel Harrison Thyng's communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951; {{for the next}} year-and-a-half stretch of the war, aerial warfare continued.|$|E
25|$|Anthony Shaffer, {{a former}} DIA officer, has claimed that DIA {{was aware of}} and failed to {{adequately}} act {{against one of the}} organizers of the September 11 attacks prior to the event, in {{what became known as the}} Able Danger controversy. Shaffer's claims were rejected and later his security clearance revoked, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> denying any wrongdoing. Later Shaffer published his book Operation Dark Heart but, upon complaints from DIA and NSA that it included national security information, the Defense Department went as far as to buy and destroy the initial 10,000 copies of the book, causing the Streisand effect.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to general postwar growth, the Cold War resulted in further growth in both Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> already established in Arlington, {{the newly formed}} Central Intelligence Agency located its headquarters further afield at Langley (unrelated to the Air Force Base). In the early 1960s, the new Dulles International Airport was built, straddling the Fairfax County-Loudoun County border. Other sites in Northern Virginia included the listening station at Vint Hill. Due {{to the presence of}} the U.S. Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, in 1952 the Allied Command Atlantic of NATO was headquartered there, where it remained {{for the duration of the}} Cold War. Later in the 1950s and across the river, Newport News Shipbuilding would begin construction of the USS Enterprise—the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier—and the subsequent atomic carrier fleet.|$|E
25|$|The Army Research Laboratory {{extended}} {{funding for}} the Arizona State University Flexible Display Center (FDC) in 2009 with a $50million grant. The university has partnered <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> on such endeavors since 2004 with an initial $43.7million grant. In 2012, researchers at the center created the world’s largest flexible full-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED), {{which at the time}} was 7.4 inches. The following year, the FEDC staff broke their own world record, producing a 14.7-inch version of the display. The technology delivers high-performance while remaining cost-effective during the manufacturing process. Vibrant colors, high switching speeds for video and reduced power consumption are some of the features the center has been able to successfully integrate into the technology. In 2012, ASU successfully eliminated the need for specialized equipment and processing, thereby reducing costs compared to competitive approaches.|$|E
25|$|Following Finland's trade {{agreement}} with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia. However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.|$|E
50|$|In early 2014, it was {{suggested}} that the United States had attempted to secure the release of Bergdahl by paying a ransom, and that <b>the</b> intermediary absconded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> money. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> states that a ransom was not paid, but there was a payment made for intelligence, that did lead to the release of Bergdahl.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the late}} stages of WWII in 1945, Galbraith was invited by Paul Nitze {{to serve as}} one of the {{directors}} of the Strategic Bombing Survey, initiated by the Office of Strategic Services. It was designed to assess the results of the aerial bombardments of Nazi Germany. Galbraith contributed to the survey's unconventional conclusion about general ineffectiveness of strategic bombing in stopping the war production in Germany, which went up instead. The conclusion created a controversy, with Nitze siding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> officials, who declared the opposite. Reluctant to modify the survey's results, Galbraith described the willingness of public servants and institutions to bend the truth to please the Pentagon as, the [...] "Pentagonania syndrome".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2016 it was {{reported}} that to meet Package 1 of the Multi Role Vehicle-Protected (MRV-P) requirement, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) was in talks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> on acquiring the JLTV via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route. “We can confirm that we are talking to the US DOD regarding Package 1 , to inform our understanding of an FMS option for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle,” said an MoD spokesman. [...] It was stated in January 2017 by Maj. Gen. Robert Talbot Rice, the director of land equipment at the Defence Equipment and Support arm of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), that: [...] "We are working through the Foreign Military Sales process. A letter of request has been sent to our American colleagues, and we expect a response in the next few months." [...] Talbot Rice told an audience of industry executives and military personnel at the International Armoured Vehicles conference in London on 24 January that the Army had opted for the single-source purchase due to its ability to meet UK requirements and its value for money.|$|E

2500|$|On August 15, 2011, the United States again {{deferred}} the ROCAF {{request to}} purchase 66 new F-16C/Ds but offered a retrofit package for older F-16A/B's. A $5.3 billion upgrade package for ROCAF's existing F-16A/B fighters was announced on 21 September 2011. The upgrade budget {{was to be}} spread over 12 years, though the Ministry of Defense indicated that it would try to reduce the period. In November 2011, the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission recommended that new fighters be sold to the ROCAF. Nonetheless, as of 2012, the MND was still haggling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> over cost and local industry participation on the upgrade. After denying the RoC Air Force the funds needed to upgrade their jet engines, President Ma Ying-jeou said that he hoped that the upgraded fighters would have on par performance. Taiwan is also balking {{at the cost of}} the radar upgrade, as it {{does not want to be}} the lead customer who pays to develop the upgrade and also because they will be unable to afford both the upgrade and the new fighters, should these be offered. In response to a U.S. vote in the House of Representatives to force the sale of the C/D models, the ROC MND said that the upgrade package offered some superior capabilities over the C/D model aircraft and some defense officials have said that in light of the PRC's increasing capabilities, only the F-35 would be sufficient. In July 2012, Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. and Lockheed Martin announced plans to establish a maintenance and overhaul center to upgrade and maintain the F-16s in place without having to ship them back to the United States. In 2012 a letter of acceptance was agreed on for a US$3.8 billion deal that included the radars, electronic warfare, structural improvements and new weapons. The high cost of the fighter upgrade is causing other modernization priorities such as tanks to be pushed back. [...] A Pentagon report has corroborated that claim, asserting that the PRC would probably seek to destroy ROCAF airfields in the first stages of any attack, making a STOVL fighter such as the F-35B vital for effective defense.|$|E
60|$|On {{the western}} side of the Itchen, exactly at the border where the chalk gives way to the other deposits, lies the ground of which this memoir {{attempts}} to speak. It is uneven ground, varied by undulations, with gravelly hills, rising above valleys filled with clay, and both alike favourable to the growth of woods. Fossils of belemnite, cockles (cardium), and lamp-shells (terebratula) have been found in the chalk, and numerous echini, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pentagon</b> star on their base, are picked up in the gravels and called by the country people Shepherds' Crowns--or even fossil toads. Large boulder stones are also scattered about the country, exercising the minds of some observers, who saw in certain of them Druidical altars, with channels for the flow of the blood, while others discerned in these same grooves the scraping of the ice that brought them down in the Glacial age.|$|E
