5|$|In the 2012–13 season, Arsenal fell at {{the last}} 16 stage {{for the third time}} in three years, losing 3–1 to Bayern Munich at home, but {{managing}} to win 2–0 in the return leg, meaning they <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> away goals rule. They were once again eliminated by Bayern Munich in the 2013–14 season after losing 2–0 at home, and drawing 1–1 away at Munich. They were eliminated by Monaco in Round of 16 in the 2014–15 season on away goals, and by Barcelona 5–1 on aggregate in 2015–16. Arsenal exited {{at the last}} 16 for the seventh consecutive time to Bayern Munich, losing 10–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton did {{go out on}} {{the softer}} tyres in Q2, setting the fastest time of the session, the first to lap in under 1 minute, 20 seconds. Behind him Vettel was second ahead of Rosberg. Räikkönen <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> harder {{compound}} tyre, but aborted his running after spinning in turn one, leaving him fifteenth fastest with a grid penalty for his gearbox change yet to come. Max Verstappen put in a fast lap {{towards the end of the}} session, demoting his teammate Sainz, Jr. out of the top ten. Also eliminated were both Lotus and the second Sauber of Ericsson.|$|E
5|$|Fearless <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same patrol, but {{encountered}} nothing. She {{participated in}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight and the Cuxhaven Raid later that year. The ship and her destroyers were transferred to the Grand Fleet in early 1915. , on the other hand, remained with the Grand Fleet and both ships played minor roles in the Battle of Jutland the following year. After the battle, Fearless was converted into a submarine depot ship and rejoined the Grand Fleet in 1917 {{as the leader of}} a submarine flotilla. A year later, she accidentally rammed and sank one submarine as part of an incident that sardonically {{came to be known as}} the Battle of May Island.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the guardrail at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile barely made it into Q2, but was under investigation for exiting the pit lane while it was closed.|$|E

25|$|From June 1943 to January 1944, the 100th Bomb Group {{concentrated}} {{its efforts}} against airfields in France and naval facilities and industries in France and Germany. The 100th BG received a Distinguished Unit Citation for seriously disrupting German fighter plane production with {{an attack on}} an aircraft factory at Regensburg on 17 August 1943.

25|$|Gregan {{missed a}} lot of the 2005 Super 12 season after {{breaking}} his leg during a game against the New South Wales Waratahs in Canberra. Gregan returned for the match against Italy in Melbourne, which the Wallabies won 61 to 29. Though after a win over the French and one over the Springboks, the Wallabies fell {{to the bottom of the}} 2005 Tri Nations Series table, losing all of their games. With his start in the final match of the 2005 Tri Nations at Eden Park in Auckland against the All Blacks, Gregan equalled England's Jason Leonard as the most-capped player for a national team in Test rugby, with 114 (Leonard also has five Lions caps). Appropriately, when Australia made their entrance for that match, Gregan <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field by himself before any of his team-mates entered the pitch.|$|E

25|$|Fifth Day of the Fifth Moon; this one-day holiday {{dubbed the}} Dragon Boat Festival {{was held in}} honor of an ancient Chinese statesman Qu Yuan (c. 340-278 BC) from the State of Chu. Ashamed {{that he could not}} save the dire affairs of his state or his king by {{offering}} good council, Qu Yuan leaped into a river and committed suicide; it was said that soon after many <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river in boats {{in a desperate attempt to}} rescue him if still alive. This act turned into a festive tradition of boarding a dragon boat to race against other oarsmen, and also to call out Qu's name, still in search of him. The type of food commonly eaten during the Tang period for this festival was either glutinous millet or rice wrapped in leaves and boiled.|$|E
25|$|Her major investigative works include La noche de Tlatelolco (Massacre in Mexico) (1971), Fuerte es el silencio (Strong is Silence) (1975) and Nada nadie. Las voces del temblor (Nothing No one: The Voices of the Earthquake) (1988). The {{best known}} of these is La noche de Tlatelolco about the 1968 {{repression}} of student protests in Mexico City. She {{found out about the}} massacre on the evening of October 2, 1968, when her son was only four months old. Afterwards, Poniatowska <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets in the neighborhood and began interviewing people while there was still blood on the streets and shoes strewn about and women searching for the children who had not come home. The books contains interviews with informants, eyewitnesses, former prisoners which are interspersed with poems by Octavio Paz and Rosario Castellanos, excepts from pre Hispanic texts and newspaper as well as political slogans. Massacre in Mexico was the only book published on the subject for twenty years, contradicting the government's account of the events and the number dead. The government offered her the Xavier Villaurrutia Award in 1970 for the work but she refused it.|$|E

Haywood commented, [...] "We were about six songs into recording and someone had this idea, so we sat down to write it." [...] Hillary Scott, Kelley and Haywood wrote the song with Dallas Davidson. Davidson discussed the conception of the song with country music blog Taste of Country: [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road with them, and we wrote a couple of things.

500|$|On Easter weekend 1991, Kennedy {{was at a}} get-together at the family's Palm Beach, Florida, estate when, {{restless and}} maudlin after reminiscing about his brother-in-law, he left for a late-night visit to a local bar, getting his son Patrick and nephew William Kennedy Smith to {{accompany}} him. Patrick Kennedy and Smith returned with women they met there, Michelle Cassone and Patricia Bowman. [...] Cassone said that Ted Kennedy subsequently walked in on her and Patrick, dressed only in a nightshirt and with a weird look on his face. Smith and Bowman <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach, where they had sex that he said was consensual and she said was rape. The local police made a delayed investigation; soon Kennedy sources were feeding the press with negative information about Bowman's background and several mainstream newspapers broke a taboo by publishing her name. The case quickly became a media frenzy. While not directly implicated in the case, Kennedy became the frequent butt of jokes on The Tonight Show and other late-night television programs. Time magazine said Kennedy was being perceived as a [...] "Palm Beach boozer, lout and tabloid grotesque" [...] while Newsweek said Kennedy was [...] "the living symbol of the family flaws".|$|E

[...] Darwin later recalled how he [...] "clambered over the mountains... with a bounding step and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer!." [...] He agreed with the saying attributed to the people of St Helena that [...] "We know we live on a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder", and noted the care taken to sustain [...] "houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain".
