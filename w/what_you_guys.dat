[...] Bart's rebellious nature, which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children. Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that [...] "Bart outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he's the child we wish we'd been, and fear our children will become." [...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as [...] "egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited." [...] In response to the criticism, James L.

5000|$|Only a few {{minority}} players, such as Tiger Woods, {{have dominated}} professional golf. Woods is of African American and Asian-American descent. With 83 percent of golf participants being white, a white majority dominates golf. Tiger Woods, a multiracial individual, has {{the second most}} major wins of any individual in golf's history with 14. [...] His excellence was well recognized as {{he became one of}} the most marketable players in the world. Woods helped tear down the imposing racial discrepancies in golf by not only competing with golf's current best but also by challenging other accomplished golfers for being the best of all time. In 1997, Woods became the first black player to win a Men's major golf championship at just 21 years of age. After winning the 1997 Masters Tournament, Woods faced ridicule from Fuzzy Zoeller, who won this championship in 1979. Zoeller responded to Woods' win by stating [...] "That little boy is driving well and he's putting well. He's doing everything it takes to win.

[...] "It's a hard world that asks you tolive with {{a lot of things that}} are unlivable", Springsteen announced before starting the show, [...] "And it's hard to come out here and playtonight, but there's nothing else to do."

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the pronominal system in Asian Englishes, namely Indian English, Singapore English, Hong-Kong English and the Philippines English. The object of study is the second person pronoun in the plural form, which, in Present-Day English, presents the canonical form you (ambiguous between the singular and the plural) and also new forms which {{have been added to the}} paradigm (Kortmann and Schneider 2004 : 1142), and which are unambiguously plural, as is the case of <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> (e. g. <b>What</b> did <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> talk last Friday) or you all (e. g. You all can leave now) among others. Thus, in this study I intend to analyze the factors that determine the selection of the alternative forms other than you and show how the gap in the paradigm for the second person plural person in PDE in Asian Englishes is being filled with these alternative forms...|$|R
5000|$|Songwriter David John Matthews, {{working in}} Charlottesville, Virginia, as a {{bartender}} at Miller's bar in November 1990, became {{a friend of}} a lawyer named Ross Hoffman. Hoffman convinced the usually reserved Matthews to record a demo of the few songs he had written. Hoffman hoped Matthews could shop the songs in order to find other musicians to perform on some studio work with him. Hoffman encouraged Matthews to approach Carter Beauford, a local drummer on the Charlottesville music scene. Beauford had been in several bands and was then playing on a jazz show on BET. After hearing Matthews' demo, Carter agreed to spend some time playing the drums, {{both inside and outside the}} studio. Matthews also approached LeRoi Moore, another local jazz musician who often performed with the John D'earth Quintet, to join them. Moore skeptically listened to the demo, but liked what he heard and decided that he too would give Matthews a chance. The trio began working on Matthews' songs in 1991. Matthews recollects that, [...] "...the reason I went to Carter was not because I needed a drummer, but because I thought he was the baddest thing I'd ever seen and LeRoi, it wasn't because I desperately wanted a saxophone, it was because this guy just blew my mind. At this jazz place I used to bartend at Miller's, I would just sit back and watch him. I would be serving the musicians fat whiskeys and they'd be getting more and more hosed, but no matter how much, he used to still blow my mind. And it was the sense that everyone played from their heart. And when we got together and they asked, 'What do you want the music to sound like?' I said, 'I know this is a song I wrote and I like <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> play, so I want you to play the way you react to my song.' There was a lot of breaking of our inhibitions." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stewart also {{discussed}} how short-selling was {{detrimental to the}} markets and investors. Cramer admitted to Stewart that short-selling was detrimental, stated his opposition to it, and claimed {{that he had never}} engaged in it, which contradicts earlier statements in which he described going short while managing a hedge fund. In a December 2006 interview from TheStreet.com's [...] "Wall Street Confidential" [...] webcast Cramer said, [...] "A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund. ... When I was positioned short—meaning I needed it down—I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures." [...] He said, [...] "I will say this: I am trying to expose this stuff, exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> do, and I've been trying to get the regulators to look at it." [...] However, Stewart played several video clips from 2006 where Cramer discussed the spreading of false rumors to drive down stock prices and encouraged short-selling by hedge funds as a means to generate returns. At one point in a clip from December 22, 2006, he said, [...] "I would encourage anyone in a hedge fund to do it." [...] He called it a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. He continued, [...] "By the way, {{no one else in the}} world would ever admit that, but I don't care, and again, I'm not gonna say it on TV." [...] Stewart responded, [...] "I want the Jim Cramer on CNBC to protect me from that Jim Cramer." [...] Cramer again admitted that he can do better, and that he should try to change. The interview ended when Stewart pointedly suggested: [...] "Maybe we can remove the 'financial expert' and the 'In Cramer We Trust' and start getting back to fundamentals on the reporting, as well, and I can go back to making fart noises and funny faces." [...] Cramer responded: [...] "I think we make that deal right here".|$|E

5000|$|Bozak joined C.G. Conn in 1944 to {{help them}} develop an {{electronic}} organ. While in Elkhart, Indiana, {{he noticed that the}} human sense of hearing was unpredictable at best. Years later, Bozak recounted this story about the Conn electronic organ project: [...] "The general sales manager, who was a pianist and played organ, sat down and played the thing and said it was great, just what we were looking for. A week later he was invited back into the laboratory and sat down and played the instrument again. He didn’t play ten or fifteen bars when he said, This goddamn thing doesn’t sound right. <b>What</b> did <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> do to it?’ We said we hadn’t done anything. Well, he didn’t believe us. ‘You did something to it.
