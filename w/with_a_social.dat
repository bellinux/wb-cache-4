5|$|Most of {{the films}} {{directed}} by Umboh were romantic melodramas, a genre which had existed in Indonesia since the 1950s but was refined by Umboh. However, he preferred shooting films <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> message; he considered Pengemis dan Tukang Becak his favourite film. When shooting, Umboh minimised his use of master shots, instead preferring to use medium and close-up shots; his obituary in Kompas notes that around 80per cent of any given Umboh film used these latter two shots.|$|E
5|$|A {{precocious}} student, Durkheim {{entered the}} École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year {{was one of}} the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his agrégation in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.|$|E

25|$|In February 1992, {{and with}} {{amendments}} in January 1995, the Riigikogu renewed Estonia's 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens. Elected on an ambitious programme of reform, Mart Laar's cabinet took several decisive measures (Shock therapy). Fast privatization was pursued {{and the role}} of the state in the economy as well as in the social affairs was reduced dramatically. After an initial steep decline in GDP, the Estonian economy started to grow again in 1995. Changes came <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> price: the average life expectancy in Estonia in 1994 was lower than in Belarus, Ukraine and even Moldova. Among the vulnerable sectors of society, the radical reforms sparked an outrage. In January 1993, a pensioners' demonstration took place in Tallinn, as pensioners felt it was impossible to live with a pension as low as the one in effect at the time (260 EEK (around 20 EUR) a month). The meeting was aggressive and demonstrators attacked the minister of social affairs Marju Lauristin.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 she reprised {{her part}} as Christine from Stolen Kisses in Truffaut's Bed and Board as a married woman. The Truffaut films {{influenced}} her type as lovingly gentle modern {{young woman in}} contemporary cinema, which she contrasted in ambivalent figures: Critic Vincent Canby praised her in work in Gérard Brach's The Boat on the Grass (Le bateau sur l'herbe, 1971), in which she starred as Eleonore, a young girl between two friends (Jean-Pierre Cassel, John McEnery). She starred in Hearth Fires (Les feux de la chandeleur, 1972) as Laura, a daughter who wants to reconcile her parents (Annie Girardot, Jean Rochefort) and {{who falls in love}} with her mother's best friend (Bernard Fresson). Alongside Robert Hossein she played the priest's love Françoise in Forbidden Priests (Prêtres interdits, 1973).
