The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted.

[...] She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.|$|E

This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to do what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

[...] The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: [...] "Based around a points system and six-sided dice, GURPS succeeds better than most 'generic' games. The rules are flexible and its well supported - regardless of what you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it, you'll probably find a supplement with some advice and background. The game suffers from being a little too detailed at times, and can get bogged down in numbers. Still, it's an adaptable system with some superb supplements." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{their second}} album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), Muse wanted {{to craft a}} more {{aggressive}} sound.

2500|$|After several delays, {{director}} Oliver Stone finally started {{production on}} the film The Doors, based on the band of the same name. Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the story because Kilmer didn't believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer saw Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, that {{were not part of}} the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told [...] "a thousand different ways" [...] and didn't want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed. Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Jim Morrison's songs prior to his audition, and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. Stone was not impressed with the tape, but Paul Rothchild (the original producer of The Doors) said [...] "I was shaken by it" [...] and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.|$|E
2500|$|After {{arguing that}} both ASCAP and BMI were showing bias towards {{international}} broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations, Pandora announced on June 11, 2013 {{that it would}} attempt to acquire KXMZ, a radio station in South Dakota, under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iHeartRadio (which is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., itself America's largest radio broadcaster). The move was criticized by David Israelite, CEO of the National Music Publishers Association, who declared that Pandora was now [...] "at war with songwriters," [...] and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to [...] "lawsuits and gimmicks" [...] to make its point. However, a member of Public Knowledge praised the move, by stating that it was [...] "a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system {{that is based on}} who wants a license instead of just what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the music they’re using." [...] ASCAP also objected to the deal, filing a petition to deny with the FCC. The organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of Pandora's intent {{to use it as a}} [...] "bargaining chip" [...] for royalty payments. ASCAP also alleged that Pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure, failing to prove that less than 25% of the company was owned by foreign interests. On January 14, 2014, the FCC denied the acquisition until Pandora [...] "demonstrate adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification." ...|$|E
