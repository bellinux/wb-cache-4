5|$|As a self-governing body, the {{orchestra}} selects the conductors with <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> works. At some stages in its history, it has dispensed with a principal conductor and worked only with guests. Among conductors with <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is most associated are, {{in its early}} days, Hans Richter, Sir Edward Elgar, and Sir Thomas Beecham, and in more recent decades Pierre Monteux, André Previn, Claudio Abbado, Sir Colin Davis, and Valery Gergiev.|$|E
5|$|The dive {{profile is}} often {{recorded}} {{in some way}} {{as part of a}} permanent record of the dive. Maximum depth, bottom time and any decompression required are routinely logged by most professional divers, for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> may be a legal requirement, and by many recreational divers, for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is usually a recommendation of the training agencies.|$|E
5|$|Conceptually {{deriving}} legitimacy {{from the}} Diet, <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is responsible to, the Cabinet exercises its power {{in two different}} ways. In practice, much of its power is exercised by the Prime Minister, while others are exercised nominally by the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|Prior to selection, the Maralinga {{site was}} {{inhabited}} by the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara Aboriginal people, for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> {{had a great}} spiritual significance. Many were relocated to a new settlement at Yalata, and {{attempts were made to}} curtail access to the Maralinga site. These were often unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{geography}} – {{the only place}} in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{returns to}} the inner Solar System have been {{observed}} and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time. The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is now named.|$|E

5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|LGBT, or GLBT, is an initialism {{that stands}} for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, {{the term is}} an {{adaptation}} of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay {{in reference to the}} LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> referred.|$|E

5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's plan {{met with}} {{opposition}} {{from most of}} the prospective member states—who refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence—as well as from the Allied powers, for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> would be too bold a change to the existing balance-of-power structure. According to historian George Sanford, around 1920 Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of this version of his Intermarium project.|$|E
5|$|Six more temples were {{discovered}} in the city, including the temple called the Massif Rouge (to <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> was dedicated is unknown), and temples dedicated for Ninni-Zaza, Ishtarat, Ishtar, Ninhursag and Shamash.

5|$|The Environment Agency is the {{navigation}} {{authority for the}} river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford. The management of the lower river has been intimately tied up with the drainage of Deeping Fen, and the river remains important to the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> provides the final conduit to the sea for pumped water.|$|E
5|$|The {{park was}} {{established}} {{on the former}} 90-acre estate of textile manufacturer Charles Pomeroy for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is named. The park entered the rolls of the Connecticut State Register and Manual in 1953, when it was listed at 84 acres, that figure expanding to 104 acres ten years later. The state added 91 acres through two separate purchases in 2001 and another 2.3 acres in 2007.|$|E
5|$|To {{develop the}} game's overall aesthetic, the main {{aim was to}} create designs that would combine comic book style with realism. The {{environmental}} architecture and characters had to be extravagant enough to represent the Batman universe, but needed realistic texture and detail. The second aim was to recreate the dark, Gothic imagery inherent to the Batman universe, especially Arkham Asylum, so that the structure would feel as insane as those <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> houses. The asylum was considered an ideal location because it can house many of Batman's foes.|$|E
5000|$|... “Voices of Violin” Concerto No.2 for {{violin and}} {{orchestra}} also represents an unusual idea: the soloist {{is invited to}} play six movements not only from different historical periods of time, not only from different geographical areas, but also different performance styles, styles of sound-making, bowing, intonation, grace notes and so on. The piece was commissioned by Trans-Siberian Art Festival 2014, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France and Berliner Symphoniker and performed by Vadim Repin to <b>whom</b> <b>it’s</b> dedicated.|$|R
