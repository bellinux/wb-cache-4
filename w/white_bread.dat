5|$|Shakshouka, {{originally}} a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically {{served in the}} same frying pan {{in which it is}} cooked, with thick slices of <b>white</b> <b>bread</b> to mop up the sauce, and a side of salad. Modern variations include a milder version made with spinach and feta without tomato sauce, and hot chili shakshouka, a version that includes both sweet and hot peppers and coriander.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{inclusion}} of oat fractions on bread quality was evaluated. An oat flour inclusion of about 10 % (as a partial {{replacement for the}} soft white flour) proved optimum for brown soda breads and enhanced crust colour and crumb softness. In yeasted <b>white</b> <b>breads,</b> an oat flake inclusion rate of 5 % (in addition to the wheaten flour) was optimum and gave bread with an enhanced loaf volume and a softer, creamier crumb {{in the presence of}} added gluten. In the absence of added gluten, the addition of oat flakes caused crumb hardening and a reduction in loaf volume in yeasted <b>white</b> <b>breads...</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{making his}} debut as Hughie Grant in the Oxford-financed Privileged (1982), Grant dabbled {{in a variety}} of jobs, such as working as an {{assistant}} groundsman at Fulham Football Club, tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows, and working for Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products such as Mighty <b>White</b> <b>bread</b> and Red Stripe lager. To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse, a regional theatre, and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate. Bored with small acting parts, he created his own comedy revue called The Jockeys of Norfolk, a name taken from Shakespeare's Richard III, with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington. Starting on a low note, The Jockeys of Norfolk eventually proved a hit at the Edinburgh Festival after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on the BBC2 TV show called Edinburgh Nights. During this time, Grant also appeared in theatre productions of plays such as An Inspector Calls (at the Royal Exchange, Manchester), Lady Windermere's Fan, and Coriolanus.|$|E

Pita bread supplemented with MG had significantly higher evenness of layers, grain appearance, and grain uniformity, leading to significantly increased overall score compared with other treatments. All supplemented pita breads did significantly differed from the control {{in the ability to}} roll and fold and quality of tearing, but these characteristics decreased upon storage. The penetrometer reading (penetrated distance) was significantly lower for the second than the first day as a result of staling of pita bread for all treatments.

25|$|In the 1930s in the United States, {{the term}} {{sandwich}} loaf referred to sliced bread. In contemporary times, U.S. consumers sometimes refer to <b>white</b> <b>bread</b> such as Wonder Bread as sandwich bread and sandwich loaf. Wonder Bread produced and marketed a bread called Wonder Round sandwich bread, {{which was designed}} to be used with round-shaped cold cuts and other fillings such as eggs and hamburgers, but it was discontinued due to low consumer demand.

25|$|Meals {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two {{meals a day}} during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of white rice each year, while {{the remainder of the}} year was filled with cheaper grains, such as millet and barley. For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as <b>white</b> <b>bread</b> and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during World War II.|$|E
25|$|The {{staple of}} the Parisian diet was bread; unlike rural France, where peasants ate dark bread, baked weekly, Parisians {{preferred}} a spongy <b>white</b> <b>bread</b> with a firm crust, fresh from the oven, which they commonly ate by soaking it in a meat bouillon. It {{was similar to the}} modern baguette, not invented until the 20th century, but took longer to make. Parisians ate an average of 500 grams of bread, or two loaves a day; laborers consumed four loaves a day. Napoleon wanted to avoid the popular uprisings of 1789 caused by bread shortages, so the price of bread was strictly controlled between 1800 and 1814, and was much lower than outside the city. Parisians were very attached to their variety of bread; in times of grain shortages, when the government attempted to substitute cheaper dark breads, the Parisians refused to buy them.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous rural children and identify the main foods contributing to their GI and GL. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of food intake of 215 children (38. 1 % were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders) 10 to 12 y old obtained by three 24 -h recalls was conducted. The foods were ranked according to their total contribution to total carbohydrates, GI, and GL. Results: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants had a significantly higher dietary GL (155. 8 ± 46. 8 versus 135. 4 ± 31. 2, P < 0. 001) and GI (58. 3 ± 3. 9 versus 56. 9 ± 3. 8, P = 0. 008) than the non-Indigenous participants. <b>White</b> <b>breads</b> were the main contributors of GI and GL in both groups and were a main driver for the increasing GI. Fiber {{was not associated with}} GI, whereas sugar and starch were positively associated. Subjects with a higher GI tended to be less physically active. Conclusion: The quality of carbohydrates in the diets of the participants was low, with poorer dietary items contributing most of the GI and GL. Substituting <b>white</b> <b>breads</b> with low/lower GI alternatives may be a useful strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Bread {{products}} are consumed {{all around the}} country. The deeply rooted bread, pastry, and dessert-making tradition derives from blending the above nationalities' products. Bakeries sell not only a wide scope of breads, cookies, and cakes, but also pastries.

The most popular type of pastry {{is said to be}} that of medialunas, based upon French croissants. Furthermore, sandwiches de miga are another type of bread products; they are made only with thin layers of <b>white</b> <b>bread</b> (generally referred to as crustless bread) and stuffed with food items ranging from ham and cheese to other more sophisticated combinations such as raw ham, tomatoes, olives, hard boiled eggs, tuna, lettuce, red pepper, and the like.|$|E
