5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. The cause <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of a sharp frost {{in the morning and}} unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{went on to}} pen {{a string}} of Adventures of Tintin, sending his {{character}} to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, the United States, Egypt, India, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, the East European kingdom of Syldavia, or the fascist state Borduria—whose leader, Müsstler, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler and Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini.|$|E

5|$|Khrimian {{collaborated with}} the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF or Dashnaktsutyun) to {{organize}} mass demonstrations against the edict. According to the historian Rouben Paul Adalian, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of Dashnaktsutyun's popular resistance and Khrimian's personal defiance {{that resulted in the}} edict being canceled in 1905.|$|E
5|$|The AEC would {{eventually}} concede, as well, that even {{low levels of}} radiation were harmful. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of rising public support for a test ban and {{the shock of the}} 1957 Soviet Sputnik launch that encouraged Eisenhower to take steps towards a test ban in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The ads {{were based}} on the film series and was {{basically}} an amalgamation of both directors visuals. For example, The Batmobile was the one used in Batman and Batman Returns, while the Batsuit <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of what was worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and George Clooney in Batman & Robin. The commercials also featured the Danny Elfman Batman theme from Tim Burton's two films.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have also been}} put forward to explain the derivation of Bunbury, and Bunburying, which {{are used in the}} play to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal acquaintance of Wilde's youth. Another suggestion, put forward in 1913 by Aleister Crowley, who knew Wilde, was that Bunbury <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> word: that Wilde had once taken a train to Banbury, met a schoolboy there, and arranged a second secret meeting with him at Sunbury.|$|E
5|$|Figures for troops {{involved}} in ancient battles are often unreliable, and Cannae is no exception. They {{should be treated}} with caution, especially those for the Carthaginian side. The Carthaginian army <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of warriors from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000-50,000. Along with the core of an estimated 8,000 Libyans, there were 8,000 Iberians, 16,000 Gauls (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and around 5,500 Gaetulian infantry. Hannibal's cavalry also came from diverse backgrounds. He commanded 4,000 Numidian, 2,000 Iberian, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-Phoenician cavalry. Finally, Hannibal had around 8,000 skirmishers consisting of Balearic slingers and mixed-nationality spearmen. The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass tube, and a stool that was electrically insulated from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E
50|$|Perceived {{sharpness}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of both {{resolution and}} acutance: it <b>is</b> thus <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the captured resolution, which cannot be changed in processing, and of acutance, {{which can be}} so changed.|$|R

5|$|In September 1994, Reso {{enrolled}} in a wrestling school at Sully's Gym, run by Ron Hutchison. One of Reso's early ring names, Christian Cage, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> {{of the names of}} Christian Slater and Nicolas Cage. Christian's wrestling career began in June 1995 in a match against Zakk Wyld, which resulted in a draw. In 1997, he was a part of Thug Life, a stable that included Joe E. Legend, Zakk Wyld, Rhino Richards, and Sexton Hardcastle (Copeland). As a tag team on the Canadian independent circuit, Copeland and Reso were known as High Impact and later The Suicide Blondes. The duo held titles in numerous promotions, and competed in the United States and Japan. Reso won the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) Heavyweight Championship on July 18, 1998, which he held until October 15, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Ravenscroft {{commissioned}} the architect Thomas Edward Knightley {{to design the}} new hall. Using a floor plan previously prepared by C. J. Phipps, Knightley designed a hall with a floor area of 21,000 square feet (2,000 m²) and an audience capacity of 2,500. Contemporary newspapers commented on the unusual elevation of the building, with the grand tier at street level, and the stalls and arena downstairs. The exterior carving was by Sidney W. Elmes and Son, and the furnishing was by Lapworth Brothers and Harrison. The lighting <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of gas and electricity.|$|E
5|$|SS Oriente <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> cargo and {{passenger}} vessel built by William Cramp and Sons, Philadelphia, for the Ward Line. In mid-1917 the United States Shipping Board (USSB) commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress, including the still-incomplete Oriente {{and her sister}} ship Orizaba. Plans for both ships were modified for troop carrying duties. Oriente was launched on 15August 1917, renamed Siboney on 28February 1918, delivered to the navy on 8April, and commissioned the same day, Commander A.T. Graham in command.|$|E

5000|$|The genus name Cyclopsitta <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the Greek name of {{the mythical}} Cyclops (a race of one-eyed Sicilian giants, whose name <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the Greek word kuklos, meaning [...] "circle" [...] and ōps, meaning [...] "eye"), and the modern Latin psitta, meaning [...] "parrot".|$|R
5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of a full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> {{electric}} {{piano and}} synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of}} a Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{was followed by}} a national day of mourning in Canada, and a ban on all E350 Ford Club Wagon type vehicles being used for student transport in New Brunswick. Two investigations, one by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the other by Transport Canada, found that the cause of the disaster <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of poor road conditions, lack of proper snow tires, and possible driver error. Pressure from the public and victims' families prompted the chief coroner of the province to launch an inquiry, which produced recommendations to improve student transport safety in New Brunswick. The provincial government agreed with the majority of the suggestions and has since enacted many of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} {{scenes were}} due to be filmed in co-operation with the Swiss army who annually used explosions to prevent snow build-up by causing avalanches, but the area chosen naturally avalanched just before filming. The final result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of a man-made avalanche at an isolated Swiss location shot by the second unit, stock footage, and images created by the special effects crew with salt. The stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. For the scene where Bond and Tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on it constantly. Lazenby and Rigg {{did most of the}} driving due to the high number of close-ups.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team {{did not want to}} disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E
