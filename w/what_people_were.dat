25|$|Interactionism {{had become}} popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a {{politically}} radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing {{society as a}} system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions. The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused {{on the process of}} law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.|$|E

Morrison dismissed these photos as [...] "rubbish". However, Johnny Rogan commented that the front cover looks far worse; it included a [...] "hilarious" [...] image of Morrison in a full-length kaftan. Morrison complained about the stereotypical front cover as well: [...] "people think you're a hippie because of the long hair and beard. ... I'd bought the kaftan in Woodstock, and that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> wearing."

There's no question that we're seeing a continuation , and even in some instances a worsening of our republic under this administration. The Obama Administration has contended that no documents stamped as secret by a government agent should ever be allowed into evidence by our courts.

2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, all I knew was that there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond v. Raymond mirrors Usher's 2004 Confessions, as a self-confessional album, {{with several}} {{recordings}} from the album inferring to Usher's marriage. Jive Records urban music president and album executive producer Mark Pitts also conceived the album as {{a return to}} the themes of the latter album; [...] "based on what happened with Confessions", Pitts wanted to reproduce its success. Pitts told The New York Times that [...] "Usher had a rough couple years", elaborating: [...] "The scrutiny of everything going on, he was worrying too much about <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> thinking. We felt like we had to get his swagger back. Dust off the bed and get it popping and young again." [...] Pitts noted that it was important Raymond v. Raymond addressed the rumors that circulated around Usher's marriage. The latter reiterated that the album is not specifically about his marriage, and that it is [...] "about the tug-of-war between man and woman, and the honesty a man has to have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 20th century, states enacted labor rights to advance social and {{economic}} progress. But despite the Clayton Act, and abuses of employers documented by the Commission on Industrial Relations from 1915, the Supreme Court struck labor rights down as unconstitutional, leaving management powers virtually unaccountable. In this Lochner era, the Courts held that employers could force workers to not belong to labor unions, that a minimum wage for women and children was void, that states could not ban employment agencies charging fees for work, that workers could not strike in solidarity with colleagues of other firms, and even {{that the federal government}} could not ban child labor. It also imprisoned socialist activists, who opposed the fighting in World War One, meaning that Eugene Debs ran as the Socialist Party's candidate for President in 1920 from prison. Critically, the courts held state and federal attempts to create social security to be unconstitutional. Because they were unable to save in safe public pensions, millions of people bought shares in corporations, causing massive growth in the stock market. Because the Supreme Court precluded regulation for good information on <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> buying, corporate promoters tricked people into paying more than stocks were really worth. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out millions of people's savings. Business lost investment and fired millions of workers. Unemployed people had less to spend with businesses. Business fired more people. There was a downward spiral into the Great Depression. This led to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt for President in 1932, who promised a [...] "New Deal". Government committed to create full employment and a system of {{social and economic}} rights enshrined in federal law. But despite the Democratic Party's overwhelming electoral victory, the Supreme Court continued to strike down legislation, particularly the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, which regulated enterprise to ensure fair wages and prevent unfair competition. Finally, after Roosevelt's second overwhelming victory in 1936, and Roosevelt's threat to create more judicial positions if his laws were not upheld, one Supreme Court judge switched positions. In West Coast Hotel Co v Parrish the Supreme Court found that minimum wage legislation was constitutional, letting the New Deal go on. In labor law, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 guaranteed every employee the right to unionize, collectively bargain for fair wages, and take collective action, including in solidarity with employees of other firms. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 created the right to a minimum wage, and time-and-a-half overtime pay if employers asked people to work over 40 hours a week. The Social Security Act of 1935 gave everyone the right to a basic pension and to receive insurance if they were unemployed, while the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ensured buyers of securities on the stock market had good information. The Davis–Bacon Act of 1931 and Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936 required that in federal government contracts, all employers would pay their workers fair wages, beyond the minimum, at prevailing local rates. To reach full employment and out of depression, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 enabled the federal government to spend huge sums of money on building and creating jobs. This accelerated as World War Two began. In 1944, his health waning, Roosevelt urged Congress to work towards a [...] "Second Bill of Rights" [...] through legislative action, because [...] "unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world" [...] and [...] "we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home." ...|$|E

Somehow, things seemed to get worse and worse, as the play went on; for our small spectator was being rapidly enlightened by the gossip going on all about her, as well as by her own quick eyes and girlish instincts. When four-and-twenty girls, dressed as jockeys, came prancing on to the stage, cracking their whips, stamping the heels of their topboots, and winking at the audience, Polly did not think it at all funny, but looked disgusted, and was glad when they were gone; but when another set appeared in a costume consisting of gauze wings, and a bit of gold fringe round the waist, poor unfashionable Polly {{did n't know what to}} do; for she felt both frightened and indignant, and sat with her eyes on her play-bill, and her cheeks getting hotter and hotter every minute.|$|E
