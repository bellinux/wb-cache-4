5|$|In 1938, Éditions Casterman {{collected}} the story {{together in a}} single hardcover volume, publishing it under the title L'Île noire (The Black Island). Hergé however <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with this publication due to errors throughout, most egregiously that the front cover omitted his name.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} for the Office of War Information's Bureau of Motion Pictures on December 2, 1942. The Bureau's chief, Lowell Mellett, <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{with the picture}} and found it heavy-handed. MGM promoted Spencer Tracy for an Academy Award for Best Actor {{but he was not}} nominated.|$|E

5|$|Van Damme {{redesigned}} {{his final}} fight with Stallone, with the latter's approval. Van Damme <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the scripted fight, which had his character running away {{and only a}} brief confrontation between the pair. He felt that the audience wanted a longer fight scene between the two actors.|$|E
5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Glover, Lord and Paice, who wanted him in the fold for the band's 25th anniversary tour, Gillan rejoined Deep Purple in 1992 to record the album The Battle Rages On. Gillan <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with working on the album, as {{it had already been}} {{partially}} completed with Joe Lynn Turner, and he was only required to write replacement lyrics and vocal melodies, which, unsurprisingly, drew criticism from Blackmore.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>unhappy,</b> Alvin Mulrady. You <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{because you}} want to give your {{daughter}} a dowry of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and you will not use the fortune that you think may be mine." ...|$|R

5|$|Even {{after the}} album had been completed, Collins <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> about leaving the drumkit to sing lead, {{and the band}} were unsure he would be {{comfortable}} as frontman on tour. The group decided to try anyway, and needed someone to drum while Collins was singing. Collins insisted on choosing the touring drummer himself, selecting Bill Bruford, who he had already worked with in Brand X. Collins continued to drum during instrumental sections.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the {{creation}} of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS), Austria-Hungary transferred the vessels of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy to the new nation. The Kingdom of Italy <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious powers. As a result, the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were 12 torpedo boats, and they had to build their naval forces almost from scratch.|$|E
5|$|Fransen {{failed to}} explain to the Bradleys that he was not the owner of the concept, and Chamberlin <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the fact that someone {{overseas}} was copying his idea.

Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Gillibrand had {{numerous}} potential challengers in the September 14, 2010, Democratic primary election. Some were obvious {{at the time}} of her appointment. Most notably, Long Island Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Gillibrand's stance on gun control, but McCarthy ultimately decided not to run. Harold Ford, Jr., a former Congressman from Tennessee, considered a run but ultimately decided against it in March 2009. Congressman Steve Israel was also a potential contender but was talked out of it by President Obama.|$|E

5|$|It transpired {{that the}} only {{manufacturer}} able to supply suitable tiles was Royal Doulton, although they were {{unable or unwilling to}} replicate DeMorgan's designs, and they were duly commissioned to manufacture the 24 tiles, delivered in May 1908. Mary Watts <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the design of the tiles, which were significantly different in colour and appearance from DeMorgan's original tiles, and they were installed without ceremony on 21 August 1908, immediately below DeMorgan's original row of tiles.|$|E

5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpah's {{longtime}} {{composer and}} collaborator Jerry Fielding {{was hired to}} do the film score for The Getaway. He had worked previously with the director on Noon Wine (1966), The Wild Bunch (1969), Straw Dogs (1970), and Junior Bonner. After the film's second preview screening, McQueen <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the music and used his clout to hire Quincy Jones to rescore the film. Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured harmonica solos by Toots Thielemans and vocals by Don Elliott, both {{of whom had been}} his associates. Peckinpah <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> with this action and took out a full-page ad in Daily Variety on November 17, 1972, including a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work. Fielding would work with Peckinpah on two more films, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) and The Killer Elite (1975). Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe award for his original score.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah {{encounters}} the Fire Gang {{had to be}} altered in post-production {{as it had been}} filmed against black velvet cloth, to disguise the puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind.

5|$|There was a {{split at}} the club in 1906, after some of the staff {{considered}} moving Juve out of Turin.
