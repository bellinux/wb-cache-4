Another of Svěrák's films, Dark Blue World, was submitted to the Academy for the 74th Academy Awards, but not accepted as a nominee. The two other Czech directors to have films accepted as nominees are Jan Hřebejk and Ondřej Trojan. Hřebejk's Divided <b>We</b> <b>Fall</b> was accepted as a nominee for the 73rd Academy Awards, but his submission for the 77th Academy Awards, Up and Down, was not. Trojan's Želary was a nominee for the 76th Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as <b>we</b> <b>fall</b> towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E

In Japan, the album peaked at number nine on the Oricon Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipping 400,000 copies. In Australia, the album debuted at number two on November 19, 1995 and topped the record chart the following week. It {{stayed on the}} top 50 for 19 weeks and received quadruple platinum award from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 280,000 copies. It also became a top-ten album in New Zealand, peaking at number eight, and was certified platinum by the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) for shipments of 15,000 copies. Overall, the album {{has sold more than}} ten million copies worldwide. With the commercial success it achieved, Something to Remember set a trend of releasing ballad albums afterward, such as the 1996 albums Love Songs by Elton John and If <b>We</b> <b>Fall</b> in Love Tonight by Rod Stewart.|$|E

She reunited with Gary Morris in 1987 to record the album, What If <b>We</b> <b>Fall</b> In Love, which would yield another theme from a {{television}} soap opera, Another World (number 4).

2500|$|When Roosevelt {{began his}} {{run for a}} second term in May 1930, he reiterated his {{doctrine}} from the campaign two years before: [...] "that progressive government by its very terms, must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but <b>we</b> <b>fall</b> back in the march of civilization." [...] He ran on a platform that called for aid to farmers, full employment, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions. His Republican opponent could not overcome the public's criticism of the Republican Party during the economic downturn, and Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a margin of 14%. With the Hoover administration resisting proposals to directly address the economic crisis, Governor Roosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds. Led first by Jesse I. Straus and then by Harry Hopkins, the agency assisted well over one third of New York's population between 1932 and 1938.|$|E
