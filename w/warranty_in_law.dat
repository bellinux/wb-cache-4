40|$|The {{history of}} the {{technical}} <b>warranty</b> <b>in</b> insurance <b>law</b> is instructive <b>in</b> showing how a rule, never very good or necessary, may, like more human creatures, so degenerate through later associations and changed conditions as to become positively bad, and so injurious to society that it must needs be brought to an end by legal process. In the United States, {{the reign of the}} technical warranty is almost over. For over a century it has been condemned by courts and text writers as an instrument of oppression and unfair dealing, and this sentence of condemnation is now being rapidly executed in the several states by the enactment of statutes wholly abolishing it as a rule of <b>law.</b> Even <b>in</b> those states, now relatively few, in which it has not been specifically abolished by statute, the warranty has been deserted even by its only friends, the underwriters. It is seldom that one now finds a trace of the <b>warranty</b> <b>in</b> the policies of reputable life insurance companies; and in the standard fire policy, now almost universally <b>in</b> use, <b>warranties</b> have been confined to a small and relatively un-objectionable field...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the legal effect of breach of <b>warranty</b> <b>in</b> construction insurance contracts in Malaysia {{in light of the}} current developments in The English insurance law. The required data and information were collected from Malaysian and English court decisions dealing with breach of <b>warranties</b> <b>in</b> English marine insurance law from the online Malayan Law Journal published on the LexisNexis online database and from published textbooks related to insurance warranties. This study would help to offer judicial guidance to courts in Peninsular Malaysia on how to resolve the legal dilemma associated with breach of <b>warranty</b> <b>in</b> Malaysian insurance <b>law.</b> It was found out that the effect of breach of a continuing <b>warranty</b> will result <b>in</b> the contract of insurance remaining in existence and the risk is being treated as having incepted at the outset but automatically coming to an end as of the date of the breach. More so, the insurer is being discharged from any future liability, although any liabilities of the insurer before the date of the breach are unaffected...|$|R
40|$|The citadel of privity has {{undergone}} a massive assault {{in the field of}} products liability yet still remains a viable force <b>in</b> <b>warranty</b> <b>law.</b> <b>In</b> most cases, the privity requirement is held to be a function of the dangerousness of the product, the type of harm caused and the situs of the chose in action. As a prerequisite to recovery under a contract theory for breach of warranty, courts have required a finding of privity [...] a direct nexus between vendor and vendee. While the strict application of the doctrine created harsh results, courts made inroads to mitigate its effects and to satisfy judicial notions of justice where conduct was inexcusable and harm intolerable. The results in some instances were unpredictable and inconsistent until they were finally codified judicially into a category of exceptions that either supplied privity directly or obviated the need for its application, although in many instances the route taken was obfuscated. This article will explore the devices employed to evade the privity requirements and will discuss the necessity of extending judicial reasoning to its logical extreme [...] the elimination of the vertical privity barrier, regardless of the qualitative aspect of the harm caused...|$|R

50|$|A {{good deal}} of {{confusion}} has been caused <b>in</b> South African <b>law</b> by the expression warranty, which {{has a variety of}} technical meanings <b>in</b> English <b>law.</b> <b>In</b> South Africa, the word warranty is non-technical and simply means ‘term’.

40|$|A {{development}} of a status of marine insurance <b>warranties</b> <b>in</b> the English <b>law</b> has been a lengthy process. Since the XVIII century, the English insurance warranty regime was governed by such rigid rules, as: the strict compliance doctrine, the absolute character of warranties, disregard to materiality or causative character of a breach and irrelevance of a future rectification. A unique remedy of automatic discharge from liability, introduced by the MIA 1906 s 33 (3), made the warranty regime even more beneficial to insurers and detrimental to assureds. In practice, this disproportion resulted in that the insurer was entitled to rely on an irrelevant breach of warranty to refuse a cover. Moreover, as the warranty regime is strikingly different from a general civil law approach to alteration of risk, its maintenance has become a hindrance for a process of internationalization of the English insurance law. Therefore, English courts and the insurance industry endeavored to mitigate harsh effects of warranties. Various measures of amelioration were adopted, {{but none of them}} could be described as a finale solution. In 2006, the UK Law Commission jointly with the Scottish Law Commission started a project Insurance Contract Law. The project concluded with an adaptation of the Insurance Act 2015, which envisaged significant changes of the warranty regime. This thesis intends to analyze the historical premises, the aims and the content of this reform, as well as its results: for instance, has the English insurance law solution became closer to approaches adopted <b>in</b> other civil <b>law</b> and/or common law countries? The main method of the research is a comparative analysis of the classical <b>warranty</b> regime <b>in</b> England, its alterations, introduced by the recent reform and the relevant approaches in other common and civil <b>law</b> countries. <b>In</b> conclusion, a summary of the {{development of}} the warranty regime and a brief outlook on future perspectives of <b>warranties</b> <b>in</b> the English marine insurance law are given...|$|R

40|$|Warranty law is an {{important}} supplement to tort law principles governing liability for defective products. Warranties arise from promises or assertions associated with either {{the sale of a}} product or some other transfer of a product for value. Such promises or assertions about a product may be express, made {{in the form of the}} seller’s statements about the qualities or attributes of the product, or they may simply be implied as a matter of policy. Although warranty law is generally regarded today as part of the body of contract law, the origins of <b>warranty</b> lie <b>in</b> tort. Important developments <b>in</b> contract <b>law</b> form a critical part of the developmental history of products liability law. Once tort law rejected privity as a limitation on the negligence law duty to foreseeable victims of personal or property injuries resulting from defective products, contract law incorporated the idea of warranties implied as a matter of law to make product manufacturers strictly liable for harms caused by defective products. This led ultimately to the recognition that the manufacturer’s strict liability was not based on an agreement between the manufacturer and the plaintiff but imposed instead by law for reasons of policy. “[T]he liability is not one governed by the law of contract warranties but by the law of strict liability <b>in</b> tort. ” <b>Warranty</b> <b>law</b> as it relates to the sale of products evolved as a matter of common law and then was eventually codified. <b>In</b> Minnesota, <b>warranty</b> <b>law</b> is expressed <b>in</b> Chapter 336 of the Minnesota Statues, Minnesota’s version of the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C. C.), and in judicial interpretations of that statute, particularly Article 2 governing the sale of goods. Additional important sources of <b>warranty</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> Minnesota include state statutes designed to protect consumers against certain deceptive and unfair trade practices and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. There is substantial similarity between Minnesota warranty law under the U. C. C. and products liability in tort, but there are also important differences...|$|R
